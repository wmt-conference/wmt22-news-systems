          <seg id="1">Матрас Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105х195.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Модель "Микропакет Престиж": комфортабельность и природный состав.</seg>
          <seg id="3">У матраса разная жесткость сторон: средне-жесткая поверхность образована латексированным кокосовым волокном и натуральным латексом, умеренно мягкая – плитой натурального латекса.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Пружинный блок с 1000 пружин на квадратный метр быстро адаптируется под тело спящего, предупреждая появление эффекта "волны" или "гамака".</seg>
          <seg id="5">Среди достоинств модели нужно выделить дышащие материалы.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Латекс, перфорированный для воздухопроницаемости, отлично вентилируется естественным образом, как и койра кокоса.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Благодаря этому сохраняется здоровый микроклимат спального места.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Также на матрас распространяется расширенный гарантийный срок.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Срок официальной гарантии от производителя – 5 лет, на деле срок эксплуатации матраса больше.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Защита от пыли и загрязнений возложена на съемный чехол из жаккарда, поставляемый в комплекте.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Приобретите в пару к матрасу ортопедическую подушку – она рекомендована для поддержания оптимального положения позвоночника во время сна.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Наполнитель определяет назначение сторон – кокос служит анатомической поддержкой для спины, латекс расслабляет мышцы.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The two sides of the mattress have different firmness: the medium firm surface is made from coconut fiber and natural latex, and the moderately soft one is from a natural latex slab.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The spring unit with 1,000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another advantage of this model is its breathable materials.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The latex perforated for air permeability is naturally well-ventilated, as is the coconut coir.</seg>
          <seg id="7">This ensures a healthy micro-climate for the sleeping area.</seg>
          <seg id="8">There is also an extended warranty for this mattress.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The official warranty from the manufacturer is valid for 5 years, but the mattress will actually last longer.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Protection from dust and dirt is delegated to the removable Jacquard cover that comes with the package.</seg>
          <seg id="11">You can buy an orthopedic pillow to complement the mattress, which is recommended to keep your spine in the optimal position during sleep.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The filler determines the purpose of each side — coconut anatomically supports the back and latex relaxes the muscles.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Германия: Четвертая прививка от коронавируса неизбежна</seg>
          <seg id="2">Четвертая вакцинация потребуется летом или осенью 2022 года.</seg>
          <seg id="3">По мнению эксперта, нынешняя вакцинация в Германии не станет заключительной, а продолжится с новой силой.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Несмотря на активную прививочную кампанию в Германии, ни двух, ни трех доз вакцины от коронавируса, вероятно, не будет достаточно для полной защиты.</seg>
          <seg id="5">В этом убежден руководитель Ассоциации врачей общей практики Ульрих Вайгельдт.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Об этом в субботу, 11 декабря, сообщает Die Welt.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Мы ожидаем, что четвертая вакцинация потребуется летом, самое позднее осенью", - считает эксперт.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Кроме того, Вайгельдт надеется, что четвертую вакцинацию от коронавируса можно будет проводить "в сочетании с вакцинацией от гриппа".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Это поможет добиться наилучших результатов.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Помимо того, усиленная вакцинация может помочь в борьбе с распространением нового штамма коронавируса "Омикрон".</seg>
          <seg id="11">Причем новый вариант особо опасен.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Так, вероятность повторного заражения "Омикроном" в три раза выше, чем у штаммов Delta или Beta.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Об этом свидетельствуют результаты предварительного исследования, проведенного в ЮАР.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Исходя из этого, производители BioNTech / Pfizer к марту 2022 года планируют предоставить вакцину, адаптированную для Omikron.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Компании подчеркивают, что две дозы вакцины не обеспечивают достаточной защиты от заражения новым вариантом коронавируса "Омикрон".</seg>
          <seg id="16">Исследование BioNTech и Pfizer показало, что при двух дозах вакцины эффективность существенно ниже: "нейтрализующий потенциал сокращается более чем в 25 раз".</seg>
          <seg id="17">"Это указывает на то, что две дозы BNT162b2 не обеспечивают достаточной защиты от заражения омикрон-штаммом", - подчеркнули BioNTech и Pfizer.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Поэтому необходима третья доза.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Эксперты настаивают на ускорении темпов вакцинации в стране.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Например, председатель Немецкого общества инфекционных болезней Бернд Зальцбергер выступает за сокращение интервала между второй и третьей прививкой.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Более того, как считает Зальцбергер, ускоренная вакцинация окажет влияние на распространение как дельта-вируса, так и омикрон-варианта коронавируса.</seg>
          <seg id="22">"Опыт Израиля очень убедительно показывает это", - подчеркнул эксперт.</seg>

          <seg id="3">According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed force.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for complete protection.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.</seg>

          <seg id="9">This will help to achieve the best results.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In addition, the increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the Omicron new coronavirus strain.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Thus, reinfection with Omicron is three times more likely than with the Delta or Beta strains.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Evidence of this comes from the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.</seg>
          <seg id="14">On this basis, the manufacturers BioNTech/Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of coronavirus Omicron.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness is significantly lower with two doses of the vaccine: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."</seg>

          <seg id="2">Серия Bet-A-Vib – особая ветвь семейcтва Bet-A от компании Pontoon21®.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Она (как и серия Kalikana Vib) отличается от множества других вибов тем, что изначально создавалась с учётом использования для подлёдной рыбалки, а не только для ловли взаброс.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Эти вибы имеют больший, чем у близких по габаритам аналогов, удельный вес, что, несомненно, положительно сказывается на нюансах применения этих интересных приманок.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Другая узнаваемая особенность – верхний плавничок из прочного и упругого пластика, создающий дополнительные оттенки вибрации при вертикальной и горизонтальной проводках.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В качестве "зимнего виба" при ловле в отвес Bet-A-Vib демонстрирует довольно агрессивную игру.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Часто наиболее уловистой бывает простая монотонная анимация, то есть движения удильником вверх-вниз почти без пауз.</seg>
          <seg id="8">При планировании отклонение от вертикальной оси не очень велико, что удобно при ловле в ограниченном пространстве, захламленном подводной растительностью, корягами и прочими препятствиями, за которые возможен зацеп.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Кроме того, небольшое отклонение актуально при ловле зимой судака и крупного окуня, и особенно в середине зимы, когда требуется точечная и агрессивная подача приманки.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Достигнув крайней точки траектории, Bet-A-Vib мгновенно разворачивается и возвращается к исходной вертикали.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Не менее успешно Bet-A-Vib применяется и для зимней ловли прудовой форели.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Чтобы угодить её капризам, можно выбрать из двух модификаций: с шумовой капсулой (NS – NanoSound) или без неё (SL – Silent).</seg>
          <seg id="13">Также отмечено, что Bet-A-Vib игрой в отвес способен раздразнить пассивную щуку, не реагирующую даже на живца.</seg>
          <seg id="14">При ловле взаброс Bet-A-Vib демонстрирует дальность и точность.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Этот воблер понятен и не капризен, хорошо сочетается с леской и плетёными шнурами даже больших диаметров.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Для ловли взаброс щуки, судака, ерша или окуня кроме равномерной актуальна и "ступенька", иногда с "чирканьем" по дну.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Если вы ловите в закоряженных местах, можно сменить передний тройник на двойник, что уменьшит вероятность зацепов.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Среди приманок своего класса Bet-A-Vib в числе наиболее устойчивых в работе и, как следствие, одной из наиболее уловистых.</seg>
          <seg id="19">С одинаковым успехом может использоваться как на относительно мелких, так и на довольно глубоких участках.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Все модели оснащены крючками Owner ST-36.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21® company.</seg>
          <seg id="3">It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally designed to be used in both ice and cast fishing.</seg>
          <seg id="4">These vibs have a higher specific weight than their close-in-size analogues, which certainly has a positive effect on the application nuances of these interesting baits.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another recognizable feature is the upper finlet made of strong and resilient plastic, which creates additional degrees of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieval.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite an aggressive game as a "winter vib" in plumb fishing.</seg>
          <seg id="7">A simple monotonous animation is often the best for fishing, which means moving the rod up and down almost without any pauses.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with submerged aquatic vegetation, snags and other obstacles you can get caught on.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for zander or large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when you need a point and aggressive bait feeding.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the initial vertical.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Also, Bet-A-Vib is equally successful when used during winter fishing for pond trout.</seg>
          <seg id="12">To please it, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS — NanoSound) or without it (SL — Silent).</seg>
          <seg id="13">It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib play plumb can annoy a passive pike that does not react even to live bait.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy during cast fishing.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fish line and braided cords even of large diameters.</seg>
          <seg id="16">When fishing for pike, zander, ruffle or perch, in addition to flat, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with scratching on the bottom.</seg>
          <seg id="17">If you are fishing in a muddy area, you can change the front treble to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snagging.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable to use and, as a result, one of the best for fishing among the baits of its class.</seg>
          <seg id="19">It can be used with equal success in both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Bet-A-Vib Series is a special branch of Bet-A family from Ponton21®.</seg>
          <seg id="3">It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other samples because it was originally created in the light of the use for submarine fishing, not only for catching.</seg>
          <seg id="4">These discharges are larger than those of the analogues close to the dimensions, which certainly have a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another recognizable feature is the upper smoothness made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional vibration shades with vertical and horizontal wiring.</seg>
          <seg id="6">As a "winter wine" when catching in the Beet-A-Vib waist shows a fairly aggressive game.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Often the most catching is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the particle up-down almost without pause.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When planning a deviation from a vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, refrained by underwater vegetation, corners and other obstacles for which the capture is possible.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching a winter vessel and a large window, especially in the middle of the winter, when a precise and aggressive bait is required.</seg>
          <seg id="10">By reaching the extreme points of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly deploys and returns to the original vertical.</seg>
          <seg id="11">No less successful Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter catching pound trolley.</seg>
          <seg id="12">You can choose from two modifications: noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).</seg>
          <seg id="13">It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib plays in the curtain can irritate passive piece, not even reacting to the animal.</seg>
          <seg id="14">When catching, Bet-A-Vib shows the range and accuracy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This obobler is understood and not captured, well combined with glossy and woven cords even large diameters.</seg>
          <seg id="16">For catching a piece, a sudden, a ersha or a window, except uniformly relevant and a "scale", sometimes with a "scale" on the bottom.</seg>
          <seg id="17">If you catch in the wounded places, you can change the front throne to a double, thereby reducing the probability of corners.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Among the baits of their Beit A-Wib class, one of the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most caught.</seg>
          <seg id="19">With the same success, both on relatively small and relatively deep areas can be used.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.</seg>
          <seg id="3">It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with ice fishing in mind, and not just for casting.</seg>
          <seg id="4">These vibes have a greater specific weight than their close-in-size counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and resilient plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wiring.</seg>
          <seg id="6">As a "winter vibe," Bet-A-Vib shows a rather aggressive game when fishing in the plumb.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Simple monotonous animation is often the most effective, that is, the movement of the fishing rod up and down with almost no pauses.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for winter walleye and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when pinpoint and aggressive bait feeding is required.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Bet-A-Vib has also been used with equal success for winter pond trout fishing.</seg>
          <seg id="12">To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).</seg>
          <seg id="13">It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to tease a passive pike, which does not react even to a live bait, with a plumb game.</seg>
          <seg id="14">When fishing, the Bet-A-Vib cast demonstrates range and accuracy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This wobbler is clear and not capricious, goes well with fishing line and braided cords, even of large diameters.</seg>
          <seg id="16">For catching pike, zander, ruff or perch, in addition to a uniform cast, a "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chirp" along the bottom.</seg>
          <seg id="17">If you're fishing in congested areas, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snagging.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most effective.</seg>
          <seg id="19">It can be used with equal success both in relatively shallow and rather deep areas.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Bet-A-Vib XL series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.</seg>
          <seg id="3">It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not only for casting.</seg>
          <seg id="4">These vibes have a greater specific weight than their counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another recognizable feature of the XL is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.</seg>

          <seg id="14">По данным агентства, "Вагнер" предположительно действует в девяти странах Африки - ЦАР, Ливии, Судане, Мозамбике, Гвинее, Гвинее-Бисау, Мадагаскаре, Зимбабве и Анголе.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Компания обеспечивает военную подготовку местных сил, личную охрану лидеров и защиту энергетических объектов.</seg>
          <seg id="16">В обмен на эти услуги дочерние предприятия "Вагнера" получают определенные привилегии и лицензии на использование полезных ископаемых и природных ресурсов, а также на поставки оружия, технологий и военных услуг в эти страны", - говорится в статье.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Как утверждают СМИ, "вагнеровцы" якобы воевали в Донбассе, Сирии, Мозамбике, Судане и ЦАР.</seg>

          <seg id="3">В результате показатели индустрии по итогам 11 месяцев оказались хуже прошлогоднего результата, сообщает Bloomberg, ссылаясь на данные Ассоциации автомобильных производителей Турции.</seg>
          <seg id="4">По данным ассоциации, в ноябре в Турции были выпущены с заводов 115 тыс. автомобилей, что на 20% меньше, чем годом ранее.</seg>
          <seg id="5">На экспорт было отправлено порядка 75,9 тыс. машин, что более чем на 25% уступает прошлогоднему показателю.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Причиной такого падения стало резкое ослабление курса турецкой лиры, которая в ноябре подешевела на 29% по отношению к доллару.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Врач предположил, что люди с ослабленным иммунитетом могут переносить его легче, чем те, у кого сильная защитная реакция организма</seg>
          <seg id="3">Пульмонолог Сергей Пурясев объяснил, почему штамм коронавируса "окмирон" может оказаться опасным.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Причина стоит искать в условиях зарождения вируса.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Ученые полагают, что "окмирон" зародился в теле инфицированного ВИЧ или страдающего иммунодефицитом.</seg>
          <seg id="6">То есть, при мутации он не встречал никакого сопротивления от иммунитета.</seg>
          <seg id="7">За счет этого он более агрессивный.</seg>
          <seg id="8">За счет того, что не было ответа от иммунитета, он стал очень быстрый.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Видимо, там у него этих спайк-белков, шипов, может быть больше, чем положено, их антитела не урезали во время мутаций, - комментирует пульмонолог Сергей Пурясев.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Врач предположил, что люди с ослабленным иммунитетом могут переносить "окмирон" легче, чем те, у кого сильна защитная реакция организма.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Оказывается, сильный ответ организма на что-либо, на любую инфекцию, - это не всегда хорошо.</seg>
          <seg id="12">В таких случаях организм может сам себя убить.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Так это и бывает при пневмококковых инфекциях, когда гибнет молодежь 30-летняя, а старики 60-летние в виде чиха это переносят.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Иммунный ответ бешеный у молодого, он совершенно неадекватный: там, где можно было только погрозить пальчиком, он бьет, как из пушки по воробьям, - заключил Сергей Пурясев.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Врач также напомнил, что у коронавируса есть опасные побочные явления и самое неприятное из них - это пневмония.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Воспаление легких бывает бактериальное и вирусное.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Если первое лечится очень успешно и быстро, во втором случае часто можно купировать только симптомы - вся надежда на организм.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Первым признаком развивающейся пневмонии будет начало интоксикации организма - это температура, слабость, недомогание.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Потом идут респираторные симптомы: затрудненное дыхание, першение в горле, кашель.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Боли справа или слева, абдоминальные боли тоже могут свидетельствовать о развивающейся проблеме.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Тем временем в России до конца года могут начать вакцинировать подрастающее поколение от 12 до 18 лет.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Вирусолог, руководитель лаборатории геномной инженерии МФТИ Павел Волчков отметил, что эта категория очень активно страдают от ковида.</seg>
          <seg id="23">У подростков, которые ходят в школу, количество контактов максимально.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Therefore, it is more aggressive.</seg>

          <seg id="18">The first symptoms of pneumonia are the onset of body intoxication: high temperature, weakness, feeling unwell.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Then respiratory symptoms appear: respiratory distress, throat irritation, cough.</seg>

          <seg id="3">По данным ВОЗ, этим заболеванием страдают более 55 млн человек.</seg>

          <seg id="5">Голошейкин отметил, что чаще всего к деменции приводят нейродегенеративные расстройства, травмы головы, некоторые инфекции, метаболические нарушения и нехватка определенных витаминов.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Некоторые факторы повышают риск развития заболевания.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Это в том числе гипертония, диабет, повышенное содержание холестерина, ожирение, депрессия и алкоголизм.</seg>
          <seg id="8">На поведенческом уровне возможна роль таких факторов как социальная изоляция и отсутствие активной когнитивной деятельности", - сказал он.</seg>
          <seg id="9">На развитие деменции также влияют и пагубные привычки - курение, злоупотребление алкоголем, нарушения режима сна и малоподвижный образ жизни.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Среди первых признаков эксперт отметил забывчивость, неспособность сконцентрироваться и снижение уровня абстрактного мышления.</seg>

          <seg id="3">According to WНO data, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The syndrome manifests itself as the systematic loss of cognitive function — as time passes, the person orientates himself with difficulty, even in familiar environments.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Golosheykin pointed out that the most frequent reasons for dementia are neurodegenerative diseases, head traumas, some infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Certain factors increase the risk of disease development.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Hypertonia, diabetes, high concentration of cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism are among them.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"On a behavioral level, social isolation and the absence of active cognitive performance may also play a role," he said.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Addictions like smoking, excessive drinking, sleep disorders and an inactive lifestyle also cause the development of dementia.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduced levels of abstract thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="11">"There is a debate that hearing loss can be either an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors of its appearance," the biologist added.</seg>
          <seg id="12">To prevent the disease, WНO recommends maintaining the proper level of physical activity, practicing cognitive skills and abilities that require involvement of memory and logic.</seg>

          <seg id="2">За последние 10 лет правительству Каира удалось вернуть на родину около 30 тыс. артефактов, которые были незаконно вывезены из страны контрабандным путем.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом сообщил в субботу, 11 декабря, в эфире телеканала Al-Hayat главный инспектор департамента возвращенных древностей министерства туризма и древностей Египта Шаабан Абдель Гауад.</seg>
          <seg id="4">С 2011 года египетскому государству удалось вернуть 29 300 артефактов.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Только в этом году в Музее Библии в Вашингтоне было обнаружено 5300 памятников древнеегипетской цивилизации", - сказал он.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Абдель Гауад уточнил, что все вывезенные контрабандным путем артефакты зарегистрированы в архивах.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Сейчас сотрудники департамента работают над их возвращением в Египет.</seg>
          <seg id="8">В частности, специалисты "отслеживают аукционы по всему миру и продажи в интернете" через зарубежные и египетские сайты, а также социальные сети.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Главный инспектор рассказал, что по возвращении культурные ценности реставрируют, а затем выставляют в музеях.</seg>
          <seg id="10">По его словам, одним из возвращенных артефактов стал обнаруженный в Бельгии древний скелет человека, который сейчас является частью экспозиции Национального музея египетской цивилизации в Каире.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В 2020 году египетские власти обратились в Интерпол с просьбой помочь найти проданный на аукционе в Лондоне бюст фараона Тутанхамона.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Аукционный дом Christie's 4 июля провел торги, на которых бюст возрастом свыше 3 тыс. лет был продан за $5,97 млн (около 680 млн рублей).</seg>
          <seg id="13">Это вызвало недовольство со стороны Египта.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Египетская сторона также утверждает, что предмет искусства незаконно вывезли в 1970-х годах из Карнакского храма в Луксоре.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Голова Тутанхамона, изображенного в образе бога солнца Амона, хранилась в частной коллекции и не выставлялась на торги с 1985 года.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Каким образом реликвия попала в Европу, неизвестно.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Египет в последние годы активно добивается репатриации незаконно вывезенных из страны в разное время памятников древности.</seg>
          <seg id="18">По данным властей, 95% контрабандных древностей является результатом археологических изысканий "черных копателей".</seg>

          <seg id="2">Credit Suisse требует от своих сотрудников предоставить банку доступ к их персональным мобильным устройствам, пишет Financial Times.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Дело в том, что в Европе и США швейцарский банк не выдает своим сотрудникам корпоративные устройства связи, вместо этого предлагая скидку на приобретение мобильного телефона или смартфона у партнера - телекоммуникационного оператора.</seg>
          <seg id="4">По действующим правилам, банк может просматривать информацию на корпоративных устройствах, выданных своим сотрудникам, так как те используются для решения деловых вопросов с коллегами или клиентами.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Банк пользуется правом проверки мобильных устройств в крайних случаях - например, если сотрудник использовал его для проведения встречи с клиентом, которая не была одобрена Credit Suisse.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Теперь же, после того как многие сотрудники перешли на удаленный режим работы, банк хочет распространить это правило на все устройства, которые были использованы для решения рабочих вопросов.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Часть 4</seg>
          <seg id="2">Последний год жизни Сергея Есенина - 1925-й - был плодотворным в плане творчества, но тяжелейшим для земного бытия поэта и его "эго".</seg>
          <seg id="3">Он уже вне каких-либо литературных объединений, расплевался с имажинизмом, он сам по себе, но известен, востребован, временами крепко ругаем критиками, даже злобно, но читающая публика готова носить его на руках.</seg>
          <seg id="4">За год было написано более 60 стихотворений, многие из них - настоящие шедевры, завершен цикл "Персидские мотивы", написана поэма "Анна Снегина", издано 8 книг, сборник "Русь Советская".</seg>
          <seg id="5">А главный успех - в конце июня 25-го года Госиздат заключил с Есениным договор на издание его сочинений в 3-х томах.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Никто из современных Сергею Александровичу поэтов такой чести не удостаивался, он первый!</seg>
          <seg id="7">К тому же это сулило очень хорошие деньги - по договору гонорар составлял 1000 рублей ежемесячно в течение 20 месяцев (директор завода, к примеру, получал 300 руб. в месяц, инженер - 200).</seg>
          <seg id="8">Средства в тот год были нужны как никогда.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Есенин женился на внучке Льва Толстого Софье Толстой, нужно было обустраивать семейный быт, содержать сестер Катю и Сашу, а также мать.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Вроде бы жизнь налаживалась, есть чему радоваться, но для него все окрашено преимущественно в темные тона, будто материализовался кошмар из поэмы "Черный человек" (написанной в ноябре 1925-го и опубликованной уже после смерти Есенина):</seg>
          <seg id="11">Друг мой, друг мой,</seg>
          <seg id="12">Я очень и очень болен.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Сам не знаю, откуда взялась эта боль.</seg>
          <seg id="14">То ли ветер свистит</seg>
          <seg id="15">Над пустым и безлюдным полем,</seg>
          <seg id="16">То ль, как рощу в сентябрь,</seg>
          <seg id="17">Осыпает мозги алкоголь.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Многие знакомые отмечали, что Есенин сильно сдал, плохо выглядит, явно болен.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Все чаще повторяются загулы, нервные срывы.</seg>
          <seg id="20">И причина, вероятно, не только в алкоголизме...</seg>
          <seg id="21">Впрочем, если такой диагноз - алкоголизм - Сергею Александровичу кем-то и ставился, достоверных документов не осталось.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Скажем, относящихся к маю 1923 года, когда Есенин по настоянию четвертой жены, американки Айседоры Дункан поправлял здоровье в клинике под Парижем у профессора Петра Ганнушкина (снова к нему Есенин попадет два года спустя, уже в Москве).</seg>
          <seg id="23">А вот свидетельств запоев поэта, скандалов на этой почве, приводов в милицию предостаточно - рассыпаны по десяткам мемуаров.</seg>
          <seg id="24">С начала 20-х страшный роман поэта с зеленым змием стремительно развивался.</seg>
          <seg id="25">В конце лета 1923 года Есенин на короткое время поселился у приятеля, имажиниста Ивана Старцева.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Удивительно, но у Есенина при его очень неплохих доходах никогда не было своего жилья ни в Москве, ни в Питере, обретался он на съемных квартирах, в гостиницах или у знакомых.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Старцев вспоминает:</seg>
          <seg id="28">"Приходил только ночевать, и в большинстве случаев в невменяемом, пьяном состоянии.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Sergei Yesenin's last year of life — 1925 — was fruitful in terms of creative work, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his ego.</seg>
          <seg id="3">He is already beyond any literary associations, he broke with imagism, he is all by himself, but famous, popular, sometimes much scolded by critics, even wickedly, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Over 60 poems were written throughout the year, many of them are real masterpieces; the cycle "Persian Motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, "Soviet Russia" collection.</seg>
          <seg id="5">And the main success — in late June in the 25th year, Gosizdat entered into an agreement with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.</seg>
          <seg id="6">None of Sergei Aleksandrovich's poet contemporaries was honored in this way; he is the first!</seg>
          <seg id="7">In addition, this promised very good money — under the agreement, remuneration was 1,000 rubles a month for 20 months (a factory manager, for example, earned 300 rubles a month, an engineer — 200).</seg>
          <seg id="8">Money was needed that year as never before.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstaya, it was needed to set up the family home, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Life was seemingly getting better, there are reasons to rejoice, but for him everything is painted primarily in gloomy tones, as if the nightmare from "The Black Man" poem (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) was materialized:</seg>
          <seg id="11">My friend, my friend,</seg>
          <seg id="12">How sick I am.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Nor do I know whence came this sickness.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Either the wind whistles</seg>
          <seg id="15">Over the desolate unpeopled field,</seg>
          <seg id="16">Or as September strips a copse,</seg>
          <seg id="17">Alcohol strips my brain.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had a significant breakdown, looks bad, is clearly ill.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Drinking bouts and nervous breakdowns happen more often.</seg>
          <seg id="20">And the reason, presumably, is not only alcoholism...</seg>
          <seg id="21">However, if somebody gave Sergei Aleksandrovich such a diagnosis as alcoholism, there are no original documents left.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Let's say, those referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in Professor Pyotr Gannushkin's clinic near Paris (Yesenin will go to him again two years later, already in Moscow).</seg>
          <seg id="23">At the same time, there is more than enough evidence of the poet's drinking sprees, related scandals, police arrests scattered in dozens of memoirs.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Since the early 20s, the terrible love affair between the poet and the green serpent evolved rapidly.</seg>
          <seg id="25">In the late summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed at his friend's, imagist Ivan Startsev, for a short time.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It is amazing, but Yesenin, with his quite good income, never had his own home in Moscow or Peter; he stayed in rented apartments, hotels or with acquaintances.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Startsev recalls:</seg>
          <seg id="28">"He came just to stay overnight, and, in most cases, he was a mess, drunk.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Once, returning at 4 am, Yesenin fell down the stairs...</seg>
          <seg id="30">Falling down, he scratched his face and he was wheezing.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Coming to his senses a bit, he started coughing endlessly, spitting blood all over the bedsheet..."</seg>
          <seg id="32">Yesenin, after a trip across Europe and the USA (prohibition was in place in the States then, but Duncan took lots of alcohol with her), confessed:</seg>
          <seg id="33">"I saw nothing there, except taverns and streets...</seg>
          <seg id="34">I even stopped recognizing people in the end...</seg>
          <seg id="35">And, he was drinking, of course...</seg>
          <seg id="36">I was drinking because I was tormented by sorrow".</seg>

          <seg id="10">Life is likely to be found, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is primarily painted in dark tones, if materialized by the nightmare of the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin):</seg>
          <seg id="11">My friend, my friend,</seg>

          <seg id="18">Many familiar mentioned that Essenin gave a lot, looks bad, clearly hurt.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Increasingly repeated guns, nervous disruptions.</seg>
          <seg id="20">And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...</seg>
          <seg id="21">However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, reliable documents were not left.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In May 1923, when Essenin was in tension of the fourth wife, American Asedori Dunkan corrected health in the clinic under Paris with Professor Peter Hanushkin (again, Essenin will fall two years later, already in Moscow).</seg>
          <seg id="23">But here are the testimony of the poets, scandals on this ground, leads to the militia are scattered by dozens of memoirs.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible novel of the poet with green snake has developed rapidly.</seg>
          <seg id="25">At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend, imaginationist Ivan Startsev.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It was surprising that Yesenin had a very low income in Moscow, neither in Peter, turned to removable apartments, hotels or acquaintances.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Old people remember:</seg>

          <seg id="32">Yes and Esenin himself after the war in Europe and the United States (the dry law was then in the United States, but Duncan captured a decent stock of alcohol) was recognized:</seg>

          <seg id="2">The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".</seg>
          <seg id="3">He is already out of any literary associations, spat with Imagism, he is in himself, but known, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in his arms.</seg>
          <seg id="4">During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".</seg>
          <seg id="5">And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House concluded an agreement with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.</seg>

          <seg id="7">In addition, this promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).</seg>
          <seg id="8">Funds were needed that year more than ever.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sofya Tolstaya, it was necessary to equip the family life, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.</seg>
          <seg id="10">It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death):</seg>

          <seg id="24">From the beginning of the 1920s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent developed rapidly.</seg>
          <seg id="25">At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, imagist Ivan Startsev.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.</seg>

          <seg id="1">"Не по Сеньке шапка": когда бархатный пиджак делает из мужчины посмешище</seg>
          <seg id="2">На светских мероприятиях 2021 года доминировали бархатные пиджаки.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Пожалуй, первым, кто заявил о своем новом модном решении, был Дэниел Крейг.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Еще в сентябре на премьере фильма "Не время умирать" он появился в бархатном малиновом пиджаке и традиционной "бондовской" бабочке.</seg>
          <seg id="5">После его примеру дважды последовал принц Уильям, который сначала надел на церемонию награждения экопремии The Earthshot Prize несоответствующий королевскому дресс-коду зеленый бархатный пиджак, а после выбрал более классический вариант на мероприятие в поддержку благотворительного фонда Royal Variety.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Пару недель назад тренд примерил на себя и Лионель Мессии.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Футболист пришел забирать седьмой "Золотой мяч" в бархатном пиджаке Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Кстати, его сыновья были одеты в такие же.</seg>
          <seg id="9">AliExpress уже отмечает растущий спрос на бархатные мужские пиджаки в России.</seg>
          <seg id="10">По данным аналитиков сервиса, поступившим в "Газету.Ru", их стали покупать в 1,4 раз чаще.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Наиболее популярны теплые бархатные пиджаки с подкладкой и приталенным силуэтом, основные цвета - темно-бежевый, бордовый, темно-синий и, конечно, черный.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Средняя цена таких моделей - от 3 до 6 тыс. руб. При этом мужчины предпочитают покупать исключительно пиджаки - комплекты бархатных костюмов они выбирают реже.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Купить их можно не только у онлайн-ритейлеров.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Бюджетные варианты есть в H&amp;M, Mango, Next и Zara.</seg>
          <seg id="15">В сегменте люкс пиджаки из бархата в этом сезоне представлены практически во всех брендах - и Brioni, и Paul Smith, и Etro, и Saint Laurent.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Самой желанной считается модель Gucci, в которой вышел на одну из премьер фильма "Дом Gucci" амбассадор бренда Джаред Лето.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Выбирая пиджаки дорогих марок, можно быть уверенным в том, что бархат сделан из шелка.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Благодаря особой технологии переплетения нитей получается плотная ткань с ворсистой внешней текстурой и гладкой внутренней стороной.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Более бюджетные варианты делаются из хлопка или полиамида, но и, соответственно, служат меньше.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Модный эксперт Lamoda Илья Вахошкин, предупреждает, что в случае с бархатным пиджаком главное - не его модель или фасон, а уместность.</seg>
          <seg id="21">"Бархат требует вечернего света, поэтому такой пиджак идеален, если вы собрались на вечеринку или торжественное мероприятие, - объясняет Вахошкин. - Он подойдет и для тех случаев, если в приглашении указан дресс-код "Black Tie" или "Creative Black Tie".</seg>
          <seg id="22">Другим важным критерием, соблюдение которого разрешает сделать выбор в пользу бархатного пиджака, является статус его покупателя.</seg>
          <seg id="23">"Мужчина в бархатном пиджаке, в первую очередь, должен обзавестись правильной продвинутой тусовкой с достатком, - считают авторы Telegram-канала о мужской моде "Красавчик Браммелл". - Обладатели бархатных пиджаков, как правило, принадлежат к касте тех людей, которые редко покупают билеты.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Их попросту приглашают на приуроченные светские мероприятия, где всегда указан дресс-код.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Илья Вахошкин предлагает сочетать пиджак из бархата с такими же нарядными вещами: классическими брюками со стрелками, однотонными рубашками, шелковыми галстуками, лоферами с кисточками, запонками.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Слишком простые и повседневные вещи будут выглядеть неуместно.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Модные эксперты из "Красавчика Браммелла" уверены: неуместным будет и появление в бархатном пиджаке рядового служащего на корпоративе, а вот если речь идет о "руководителе из числа тех, кто этим мероприятием заправляет, то - "да", ему такая вещь в тему".</seg>
          <seg id="28">Если служащий рангом пониже, а целью его является желание продвинуться повыше в сложной иерархии компании или выбить финансовые бонусы, то лучше бархатный пиджак не надевать.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Руководство это точно оценит фразой "не по Сеньке шапка", - считают редакторы Telegram-канала о мужской моде.</seg>

          <seg id="1">"The hat is not for Senka": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock</seg>
          <seg id="2">Velvet jackets prevailed at the social events of 2021.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Perhaps, the first person to declare his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Back in September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.</seg>
          <seg id="5">His example was then followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that was inappropriate for the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize environmental award ceremony and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Lionel Messi also tried out the trend a few weeks ago.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The footballer came to pick up his seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket.</seg>
          <seg id="8">By the way, his sons wore the same.</seg>
          <seg id="9">AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="10">According to data from the service's analysts, obtained by Gazeta.Ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.</seg>

          <seg id="24">They are simply invited to coinciding social events, where the dress code is always specified.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with things that are just as elegant: classic pleated pants, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, tassel loafers, cufflinks.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Things that are too simple and casual will look inappropriate.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Fashion experts from Krasavchik Brammell are convinced: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will be inappropriate, but if it is "one of the heads from those who run the event, then — yes, such a thing will be just for him."</seg>
          <seg id="28">If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move up higher in the company's complex hierarchy or wheedle out financial bonuses, than it would be better not to put on a velvet jacket.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Velvet jackets dominated the social events of 2021.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Back in September, at the premiere of the film "It's not time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.</seg>
          <seg id="5">His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that did not comply with the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity foundation.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiahs tried on the trend.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket.</seg>
          <seg id="8">By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.</seg>
          <seg id="9">AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="10">According to the analysts of the service, received by "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy them 1.4 times more often.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.</seg>
          <seg id="13">You can buy them not only from online retailers.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Budget options are available in H&amp;M, Mango, Next and Zara.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The most desirable model is considered to be Gucci, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".</seg>
          <seg id="17">Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a fleecy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.</seg>
          <seg id="19">More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, they serve less.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its relevance.</seg>
          <seg id="21">"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a special event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is specified in the invitation.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.</seg>
          <seg id="23">"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced hangout with prosperity," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell" believe. - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.</seg>
          <seg id="24">They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Fashion experts from the "Handsome Brummell" are sure that the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then - "yes," such a thing is in the subject for him."</seg>
          <seg id="28">If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.</seg>

          <seg id="23">"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the correct advanced party with wealth," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brammell" believe. "Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.</seg>
          <seg id="24">They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Ilya Vakhoshkin proposes to combine a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Fashion experts from Brammell's Beauty are sure that the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate event will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then" yes, "he is such a thing in the subject."</seg>
          <seg id="28">If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not according to Senka's hat," the editors of the Telegram channel believe about men's fashion.</seg>

          <seg id="1">"Большая семерка" предупредила Россию о "масштабных последствиях" в случае вторжения в Украину</seg>
          <seg id="2">Страны "Большой семерки" (Великобритания, Германия, Италия, Канада, США, Франция и Япония) опубликовали заявление по итогам встречи глав МИД в Ливерпуле.</seg>
          <seg id="3">В нем подчеркивается, что "военная агрессия" России против Украины "будет иметь огромные последствия и дорого обойдется" Москве, но конкретные меры в документе не описываются.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"Мы, министры иностранных дел Канады, Франции, Германии, Италии, Японии, Соединенного Королевства и Соединенных Штатов Америки и Высокий представитель Европейского Союза, едины в нашем осуждении наращивания военной мощи России и агрессивной риторики в отношении Украины", - говорится в заявлении.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Далее министры призывают Россию "ослабить эскалацию, использовать дипломатические каналы и соблюдать свои международные обязательства в отношении прозрачности военной деятельности", о чем президент США Байден говорил во время видеозвонка президенту РФ Путину 7 декабря.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"Мы подтверждаем нашу поддержку усилий Франции и Германии в нормандском формате по достижению полного выполнения Минских соглашений с целью урегулирования конфликта на востоке Украины", - заявляют также министры иностранных дел "Большой семерки".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Любое применение силы для изменения границ строго запрещено международным правом.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Россия не должна сомневаться в том, что дальнейшая военная агрессия против Украины будет иметь огромные последствия и серьезную цену в ответ", - предупреждают они.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Мы подтверждаем нашу непоколебимую приверженность суверенитету и территориальной целостности Украины, а также право любого суверенного государства определять свое будущее.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Мы приветствуем сдержанную позицию Украины.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Мы будем интенсифицировать наше сотрудничество по нашему общему и всестороннему ответу", - говорится также в заявлении.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Ранее днем глава британской дипломатии Элизабет Трасс заявила, что Россия подвергнется "серьезным последствиям" в случае вторжения на Украину.</seg>
          <seg id="13">По ее словам, эта встреча показала "единый голос стран "Большой семерки", на долю которых приходится 50% мирового ВВП, и которые очень ясно дали понять, что вторжение в Украину будет иметь огромные последствия для России".</seg>

          <seg id="2">Глава министерства обороны Украины Алексей Резников обвинил правительство бывшего канцлера ФРГ Ангелы Меркель в блокировке приобретения Киевом смертоносного оружия в рамках НАТО.</seg>
          <seg id="3">В интервью газете Financial Times 12 декабря Резников напомнил, что в прошлом месяце Германия наложила вето на закупку Украиной противоснайперских систем и винтовок для поражения беспилотников.</seg>
          <seg id="4">При этом отмечается, что позднее Берлин смягчил свою позицию касательно винтовок, признав их несмертоносным оружием.</seg>
          <seg id="5">По утверждению министра обороны, Киев намерен добиваться приобретения вышеупомянутого оружия в рамках двусторонних соглашений с союзниками.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В частности, речь идет о США, Великобритании, Литве и Франции.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Между тем FT отмечает, что позиция нового немецкого правительства под руководством канцлера Олафа Шольца по поводу разрешения поставок вооружений на Украину пока остается неясной.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Ранее в воскресенье посол Украины в Германии Андрей Мельник выразил мнение, что Киеву не стоит ждать от Берлина поставок оружия при канцлере Шольце.</seg>
          <seg id="9">По его словам, предыдущее руководство ФРГ объясняло свой отказ в предоставлении вооружений риском развития военной эскалации конфликта в Донбассе, несмотря на "оккупацию Россией" части украинской территории.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Такую же "нелогичную" позицию, уверен дипломат, Германия сохранит и при новом канцлере.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В августе украинский лидер Владимир Зеленский заявил, что Киев ожидает помощи от Берлина в оснащении морского флота.</seg>
          <seg id="12">На Украине рассчитывают, что Германия "будет партнером Украины в техническом смысле", добавил президент.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Также отмечалось, что весной текущего года сопредседатель партии "зеленых" ФРГ Роберт Хабек посетил республику, где выступил за продажу Киеву оборонительных вооружений.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Oleksii Reznikov, head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, has accused the government of the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of preventing Kyiv from buying deadly weapons from NATO.</seg>
          <seg id="3">In his interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of counter-sniper systems and rifles for striking drones.</seg>
          <seg id="4">There is also a mention that Berlin later softened its stance on the rifles, acknowledging them as non-deadly weapons.</seg>
          <seg id="5">According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to make every effort to obtain the above-mentioned weapons as part of the bilateral agreements with its allies.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.</seg>
          <seg id="7">However, as FT points out, the position of the new German government headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on permitting weapons supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect deliveries of weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to him, the previous German leadership attributed its refusal to supply weapons to the risk of military escalation of the Donbas conflict, despite the fact that "Russia was occupying" part of Ukraine's territory.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The diplomat is convinced that Germany will hold the same "illogical" stance under the new chancellor.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In August, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Kyiv counts on Berlin's help to equip its navy.</seg>
          <seg id="12">They expect Germany to be "Ukraine's partner in the technical sphere," the president added.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It was also mentioned that spring this year marked the visit of Robert Habeck, the co-leader of Germany's "Green" Party, to the republic, where he advocated selling defensive weapons to Kyiv.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Раскрыты способы возврата украденных через интернет-магазины денег</seg>
          <seg id="2">Существует несколько способов, чтобы вернуть деньги, украденные через интернет-магазины, и не стать жертвой мошенничества в будущем.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Их раскрыли эксперты по информационной безопасности в беседе с РБК.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Так, для снижения риска крупных потерь при попадании данных банковской карты в руки злоумышленников рекомендуется хранить основные средства на карте или банковском счете, которые не используются при онлайн-шопинге.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Часть накоплений можно откладывать на сберегательный счет и выводить по мере необходимости.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Эксперты рекомендуют также завести отдельную карту для покупок в сети.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Если деньги были украдены при покупках в магазинах, не использующих защитную технологию 3D Secure, можно запустить процедуру возврата средств.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"В рамках правил, установленных платежными системами, по несанкционированным транзакциям, проведенным без использования 3D Secure, ответственность возлагается на того участника в цепочке расчетов, кто не использует данный сервис", - уточнил представитель Промсвязьбанка.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Эксперт от международного платежного провайдера Ecommpay Артур Заремба подчеркнул, что покупатель имеет право подать заявление в банк на оспаривание мошеннической операции не позднее чем через 120 дней после покупки.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Помимо этого, если преступник использовал карту на онлайн-ресурсах, не требующих двухфакторной авторизации, транзакцию можно опротестовать и вернуть деньги.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Отмечается, что в некоторых случаях интернет-магазины сами возвращают средства клиенту, если заказ еще не отправили в доставку.</seg>
          <seg id="12">19 ноября член Общественной палаты, директор Лиги безопасного интернета Екатерина Мизулина сообщила, что только в 2021 году было получено 11 тысяч обращений по разным случаям мошенничества: от продажи поддельных документов до кражи персональных данных.</seg>
          <seg id="13">По ее словам, эффективным решением при текущих обстоятельствах может стать создание единого окна для жалоб на онлайн-мошенников.</seg>

          <seg id="2">There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="3">They were revealed by information security experts during a conversation with RBC.</seg>
          <seg id="4">So, to reduce the risk of big losses if the bank card details fall into the hands of fraudsters, it is recommended keeping the main funds on a card or a bank account that are not used for online shopping.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Part of the savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.</seg>
          <seg id="7">If money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use the protective 3D Secure technology, you can initiate the refund procedure.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions made without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," said the representative from Promsvyazbank.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Artur Zaremba, an expert at the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer is entitled to apply to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It is noted that in some cases, online stores return funds to the customer themselves if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.</seg>
          <seg id="12">On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, member of the Public Chamber, head of the Safe Internet League, reported that 11 thousand appeals on different cases of fraud were received in 2021 alone: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.</seg>
          <seg id="13">According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.</seg>

          <seg id="9">The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to lodge an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Шольц прибыл в Польшу для обсуждения "Северного потока-2" и законодательства ЕС</seg>
          <seg id="2">Новоизбранный канцлер Германии Олаф Шольц прибыл в Варшаву для переговоров, посвященных кризису с мигрантами на границе с Беларусью, независимости судебной власти в Польше, наращиванию российских войск у границ Украины и ситуации с российским газопроводом "Северный поток-2".</seg>
          <seg id="3">Хотя Шольц заявлял о своем стремлении к сохранению хороших отношений между Германией и Польшей на долгие годы, лидеры двух стран выразили недвусмысленные ожидания друг от друга.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Премьер-министр Польши Матеуш Моравецкий заявил, что он будет призывать Шольца выступить против "Северного потока-2", по которому предполагается доставлять российский газ в Германию в обход Украины.</seg>
          <seg id="5">По мнению Моравецкого, Россия может использовать газопровод против Европы как средство политического давления.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В свою очередь, Германия поддержала усилия Польши по остановке потока мигрантов, пытающихся попасть в страну из Беларуси.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Берлин заявил, что поможет Варшаве и Брюсселю в урегулировании этого кризиса.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Судебная система Польши, однако, остается одной из причин для разногласий.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Европейский суд оштрафовал Польшу, установив, что судебные реформы, проведенные правой партией "Право и справедливость", нарушают законодательство ЕС.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Польша отказалась платить штраф, и ее высший суд постановил, что национальное законодательство имеет приоритет над правилами ЕС.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Новое правительство Германии, приведенное к присяге в среду, несмотря на требования Польши и США, не взяло на себя публичных обязательств остановить работу "Северного потока-2" в случае вторжения России в Украину.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Американские чиновники заявили членам Конгресса, что они достигли понимания с Германией об остановке газопровода, если Россия вторгнется в Украину, сообщил во вторник высокопоставленный сотрудник Конгресса США.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Германские официальные лица не подтвердили эти сообщения, но Шольц в среду предупредил о последствиях, если Россия нарушит границу Украины, и эту позицию в воскресенье подтвердили представители "Большой семерки".</seg>

          <seg id="1">Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU laws</seg>
          <seg id="2">The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the Belarussian border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, Russia's troop buildup around Ukraine and the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline situation.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Although Scholz declared his aspiration for good long-term relations between Germany and Poland, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to act against Nord Stream 2, which is designed to transport Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="5">According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In turn, Germany supported Poland's effort to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Berlin announced its assistance to Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The European court fined Poland, having established that the judicial reforms adopted by the right-wing Law and Justice party infringe EU law.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Poland refused to pay the fine and its supreme court has ruled that national laws have priority over EU rules.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the US, has not made any public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="12">American officials declared to members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about halting the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, reports a high-ranking US member of Congress on Tuesday.</seg>
          <seg id="13">German officials did not confirm these statements, but on Wednesday, Scholz warned of the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by G7 on Sunday.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Сантехнику, который нашел деньги в стене церкви в американском штате Техас, выплатят награду.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом сообщается в пресс-релизе некоммерческой организации Crime Stoppers of Houston.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Инцидент произошел в крупной евангелической церкви Лейквуд, где проповедует пастор Джоэл Остин, обещающий, что набожных христиан ждет богатство и процветание.</seg>
          <seg id="5">В ноябре 2021 года сантехник Джастин Коули ремонтировал один из церковных туалетов и обнаружил под теплоизоляцией тысячи пакетов с деньгами и чеками.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Он передал находку церкви и, по его словам, не получил от Остина даже благодарности.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Я хотел услышать, как он скажет: "Знаешь, Джастин, ты поступил правильно.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Мы понимаем, что ты сделал и что мог бы сделать"", - цитирует его KPRC-TV.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Судя по всему, находка связана с кражей, которая произошла в церкви Лейквуд семь лет назад.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Тогда пропали около 200 тысяч долларов наличными и 400 тысяч долларов в виде чеков, которые хранились в церковном сейфе.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Деньги были застрахованы, поэтому церковь не понесла убытков.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Тем не менее за информацию о преступниках объявили награду, составлявшую 25 тысяч долларов.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Джастин Коули не мог претендовать на эту сумму, поскольку срок действия награды уже истек.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Несмотря на это, некоммерческая организация Crime Stoppers of Houston, в свое время выделившая на награду пять тысяч долларов и позднее получившая еще 20 тысяч долларов в дар от церкви Лейквуд, решила вознаградить честность сантехника.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Он получит 20 тысяч долларов.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Ранее сообщалось, что полиция допросила пастора Джоэла Остина по поводу денег, найденных в стене церкви Лейквуд.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Вирусолог, доктор медицинских наук, заслуженный деятель науки России Анатолий Альтштейн в беседе с Ura.ru раскрыл схему полной защиты от коронавирусной инфекции.</seg>
          <seg id="3">По его словам, этого можно добиться путем введения инъекции и применения назальной вакцины.</seg>
          <seg id="4">При интерназальном применении образуются в большом количестве иммуноглобулины А. При введении вакцины инъекцией этого не происходит.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Иммуноглобулины А защищают слизистую оболочку, поэтому вирус не может проникнуть в организм.</seg>
          <seg id="6">А внутри после вакцинации у нас больше всего образуется иммуноглобулинов G (антитела).</seg>
          <seg id="7">И если вы введете обе вакцины, то получите много иммуноглобулинов A и G. Но пока нет решения о двойной вакцинации", - рассказал медик.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Главный профилактолог УрФО, доктор медицинских наук Сергей Токарев, в свою очередь, заявил, что главным преимуществом применения назальной вакцинации совместно с инъекционной является возможность перестать являться носителем COVID-19.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Он добавил, что это поможет тем, что в таком случае защита организма, предположительно, должна стать максимальной.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Ранее министр здравоохранения Нижегородской области Давид Мелик-Гусейнов заявил, что к новому всплеску пандемии COVID-19 приведет распространение новой коронавирусной инфекции среди детей.</seg>
          <seg id="11">По его словам, именно такая картина наблюдается в других странах, куда очередная волна пандемии пришла раньше.</seg>

          <seg id="3">According to him, it can be achieved by injection and by using a nasal vaccine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">With intranasal use, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are produced. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.</seg>

          <seg id="6">And inside, after vaccination, the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies) are being produced.</seg>
          <seg id="7">And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet," said the physician.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Sergei Tokarev, chief preventologist of the UFD, in turn, said that the main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection was the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He added that it would help because in this case, the body's protection should probably reach its maximum.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Earlier, Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseinov, said that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new episode of the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>

          <seg id="3">According to him, this can be achieved by injection and use of nasal vaccine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Internasal use produces large amounts of immunoglobulin A. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And inside after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).</seg>
          <seg id="7">And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The chief prophylactician of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injectable vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He added that this will help that in such a case the protection of the body, presumably, should become the maximum.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Earlier, Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseinov said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
          <seg id="11">According to him, this is the picture in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Всемирная организация здравоохранения (ВОЗ) заявила, что новый штамм коронавируса "омикрон" выявлен уже в 63 странах.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Ряд экспертов уже говорят, что распространение нового штамма может иметь катастрофические последствия.</seg>
          <seg id="4">О темпах распространения штамма рассказали в сообщении ВОЗ.</seg>
          <seg id="5">По данным организации на 9 декабря штамм выявлен уже в 63 странах, во всех шести регионах ВОЗ.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Это при том, что он стал активно распространяться только с конца ноября.</seg>
          <seg id="7">ВОЗ выражает также обеспокоенность высокими темпами распространения нового варианта коронавируса.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Эксперты ВОЗ выражают опасение, что новый штамм по предварительным данным может обойти по степени распространения штамм "дельта", он же индийский вариант коронавируса, который лидирует сейчас во всех абсолютно странах без исключения.</seg>
          <seg id="9">До этого генеральный директор Всемирной организации здравоохранения Тедрос Адханом Гебрейесус заявил, что омикрон-штамм способен оказать существенное влияние на ход пандемии коронавируса.</seg>
          <seg id="10">В аналогичным выводам пришли также и в Великобритании.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Эксперты Лондонской школы гигиены и тропической медицины (LSHTM) считают, что "омикрон" в ближайшие месяцы вытеснит "дельту".</seg>
          <seg id="12">А число заболевших только в Британии составит около 1 млн. Это при том, что официально "омикроном" в настоящий момент в Королевстве болеют несколько сотен человек, а по оценочным данным до 10 тысяч.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Британские эксперты прогнозируют десятки тысяч смертей от штамма "омикрон", а на пике в больницы будут отвозить более 2 тысяч человек ежедневно.</seg>
          <seg id="14">С чем британская системе здравоохранения справиться будет не в состоянии.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Ситуация осложняется тем, что согласно последним исследованиям эффективность вакцины от компании Pfizer-BioNTech против штамма "омикрон" в 32 раза ниже в сравнении с остальными видами заболевания.</seg>
          <seg id="16">О том как реагирует на "омикрон" российский "Спутник V" пока неизвестно - это станет понятно в ближайшие несколько недель.</seg>

          <seg id="3">A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain can have disastrous consequences.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The WHO reported on the strain's spread rate.</seg>
          <seg id="5">According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.</seg>
          <seg id="6">This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The WHO is also concerned about the high spread rate of the new coronavirus variant.</seg>
          <seg id="8">WHO experts fear that, according to preliminary data, the new strain can beat the Delta strain spread rate, the same as the Indian coronavirus variant, which is now leading in all countries without exception.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Previously, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.</seg>
          <seg id="12">And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that currently several hundred people officially have Omicron in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.</seg>

          <seg id="15">The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Такие данные опубликовала аналитическая компания App Annie, представившая доклад о рынке мобильных приложений в 2021 году.</seg>
          <seg id="8">В 2021 году мировая экономика вышла из локдауна и начала постпандемийное восстановление.</seg>
          <seg id="9">"Затормозит ли такой "возврат к физическому" рост экономики приложений? Нисколько", - считают авторы доклада.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Лидером по числу скачиваний приложений стала Индия: на нее приходится около 20% всех загрузок.</seg>
          <seg id="11">За ней идут США (9%) и Бразилия (8%).</seg>
          <seg id="12">Пользователи гаджетов на iOS, как и раньше, тратили больше, чем пользователи с Android: на iOS пришлось 65% всех расходов в приложениях.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Среди приложений первое место по числу скачиваний за 2021 год занял видеоредактор CapCut.</seg>

          <seg id="15">В топ-10 по числу загрузок входит также Telegram.</seg>
          <seg id="16">В целом, если судить по количеству скачиваний, среди пользователей популярны VPN-сервисы (их в топ-10 два - VPN Master и NightOwl VPN) и сервисы, связанные с созданием и трансляцией видео (помимо CapCut и MX TakaTak в топ-10 входят еще два таких сервиса - Moj и SnackVideo).</seg>
          <seg id="17">"Больше всего пользователи потратили в приложениях для прямых трансляций и онлайн-стриминга", - отмечают авторы доклада.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Лидирует здесь YouTube, в топ-5 по расходам пользователей также входят видеосервис TikTok, стриминговые видеосервисы Disney+ и HBO Max, а также японский сервис подписки на мангу Piccoma.</seg>

          <seg id="23">Во всем мире люди адаптировались к пандемии через переход на жизнь в мобайле, что можно назвать одним из главных выводов.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Наибольших успехов добились те отрасли, которые помогали людям быть ближе как виртуально, так и лично", - прокомментировал результаты доклада руководитель отдела маркетинговых исследований App Annie Лекси Сидоу.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Выручка сектора мобильных игр в 2021 году достигла $90 млрд. Лидерами по числу скачиваний оказались казуальные и гиперказуальные игры, в которых нет или почти нет сюжета, а видеооформление минимально.</seg>
          <seg id="26">В топ-3 самых популярных игр в мире вошли Count Masters, Project Makeover и Bridge Race.</seg>
          <seg id="27">В России среди игр лидируют DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls и Phone Case DIY.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Ранее App Annie представила свой прогноз на 2022 год.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Среди основных трендов следующего года аналитики компании назвали рост числа пользователей TikTok до 1,5 млрд, рост популярности у поколения Z финансовых приложений, например приложения для инвесторов Robinhood, а также дальнейшее увеличение популярности метаверсивных мобильных игр.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Злоумышленники начали искать новые маневры для мошенничества в видеосообщениях.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом пишут "Известия" со ссылкой на экспертов.</seg>
          <seg id="4">По словам директора по продуктам компании Ivideon Заура Абуталимова, главной опасностью, которая связана с распространением средств видеокоммуникации, являются дипфейки.</seg>
          <seg id="5">В этом случае мошенниками создается фейковое видео на основе реальных записей с участием жертвы.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Благодаря этому нейросети удается в точности воспроизвести особенности поведения того или иного человека.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Абуталимов добавил, что используя дипфейк, злоумышленники могут звонить знакомым жертвы по видеосвязи или создать ролик с участием копии человека для рассылки с целью шантажа.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Такие подделки запросто могут спровоцировать буллинг, поскольку подкованный злоумышленник может поместить людей в нелепые, опасные или компрометирующие псевдосценарии", - сказал эксперт.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Ведущий системный инженер Varonis Александр Веткол в свою очередь отметил, что психологически люди больше доверяют другим, когда видят их.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Он подчеркнул, что это может создать специфические риски в случае, когда речь идет о технологиях с использованием видео.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Проблемы с уровнем сахара в крови - одни из самых распространенных в мире.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Однако некоторые не придают этому большого значения, и зря.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Сахарный диабет может со временем привести к тяжелым осложнениям и даже смерти.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Профилактические мероприятия играют главную роль в предотвращении формирования заболеваний.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Так, врачи рекомендуют поменять питьевой режим - снижение количества разнообразных напитков и переход на обычную воду положительно влияют на метаболизм.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Сладкие продукты повышают уровень сахара в крови до опасного показателя, когда употребляются в избыточном количестве.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Поэтому первый шаг на пути к здоровому образу жизни - это перестать покупать сладости и хранить их дома.</seg>
          <seg id="9">На появление заболевания влияет не только неправильное питание, но и привычки.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Чтобы уменьшить риски сахарного диабета, необходимо много двигаться.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Специалисты советуют придерживаться низкоуглеводной диеты.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Подобный рацион не только поможет снизить вес, но и защитит от резких колебаний уровня сахара.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Для защиты от заболевания диабетом необходимо съедать много клетчатки.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Пищевые волокна наполняют желудок и таким образом способствуют возникновению чувства сытости, выделению пищеварительных соков и повышению усвоения пищи.</seg>

          <seg id="2">К ухудшению самочувствия в выходные могут приводить несколько факторов</seg>
          <seg id="3">Причиной ухудшения самочувствия после рабочих будней зачастую является "мигрень выходного дня", рассказала известный врач-эндокринолог, кандидат медицинских наук, старший научный сотрудник факультета фундаментальной медицины МГУ, научный руководитель клиники Системной медицины Зухра Павлова в своем телеграм-канале.</seg>
          <seg id="4">По ее словам, особенно часто от этого страдают трудоголики, у которых в выходные наблюдаются головная боль, разбитость и слабость.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Доктор Павлова отметила, что помимо накопившейся за неделю усталости есть достаточно много объективных причин негативной реакции организма на изменение условий.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В выходные наша жизнь коренным образом меняется.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Спим долго, весь день лежим на диване, скорее всего едим больше, а пьем меньше, - аргументировала врач. - Из-за недостатка кофе начинается небольшая ломка.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Из-за переедания и недостатка воды - тяжесть и разбитость".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Дополнительную роль играет поздний подъем.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Так, если встать на три часа позже обычного, то возникнет реакция, которую называют джетлаг.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Она возникает у путешественников, которые пересекают несколько часовых поясов.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Чтобы определить, какой из факторов играет решающую роль в ухудшении самочувствия, Павлова рекомендовала проследить, что сильнее всего меняется в выходные.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Several factors may cause discomfort during weekends</seg>
          <seg id="3">The reason for feeling unwell at the end of the working week frequently lies in the "weekend migraine", the renowned Endocrinologist, PhD in Medicine, Senior Research Associate of the Fundamental Medicine Department of Moscow State University, Academic Advisor of Systems Medicine Clinic, Zukhra Pavlova told on her Telegram channel.</seg>
          <seg id="4">According to her, it is most widespread among workaholics who suffer from headache, fatigue and weakness in the weekends.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Doctor Pavlova noted that apart from fatigue accumulated during weekdays, there are many intrinsic reasons for the body's negative response to changing circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="6">On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"We sleep longer, spend the entire day on the sofa, most likely, eat more and drink less water," the doctor argues. "Due to a lack of caffeine, we suffer mild withdrawal symptoms.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Overnutrition and dehydration cause distress and fatigue."</seg>
          <seg id="9">Getting up late is another factor.</seg>
          <seg id="10">So, if you wake up three hours later than usual, you can experience the so-called jetlag.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It is experienced by travelers who change several time zones.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In order to determine which factor plays the key role in discomfort, Pavlova recommended tracking major changes during weekends.</seg>

          <seg id="7">"Sleeping for a long time, all day I lie on the sofa, probably eat more, and the pem less," the doctor argumented. "Owing to the lack of coffee, a small scratch begins.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Сахар - не лучший источник полезных питательных веществ.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Его избыток в рационе может привести к диабету второго типа, а также вызвать сердечно-сосудистые и онкологические заболевания.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Потребителям следует учитывать, что под незнакомым словом в составе продукта может быть указан скрытый сахар - ингредиент, аналогичный сахару по калорийности, составу и гликемическому индексу.</seg>
          <seg id="5">На этикетке могут быть представлены несколько десятков названий, по сути, обозначающих сахар.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Одни из самых распространенных и часто встречающихся названий - глюкоза и фруктоза.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Также могут быть другие срытые сахара, такие как декстроза (сахар, полученный из кукурузы), левулоза (фруктовый сахар), меласса (черная патока), сироп агавы и т.д.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Это все простые углеводы, которые относятся к моно- и дисахаридам, и они могут быть не только в кондитерских изделиях, но и в кетчупе, в докторской колбасе, хлебе и т.д.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Как заявляют в Роскачестве, самый эффективный способ снизить потребление сахара - употреблять цельные и необработанные продукты, а также обращать внимание на этикетку и на множество различных названий сахара.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Разные виды сахара отличаются по вкусу, но как бы ни назывался ингредиент в составе продукта - сироп или нектар, обработанный или необработанный, коричневый или белый, - он все равно остается сахаром.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Подсчитать точное количество сахара непросто, так как необходимо учитывать не только количество сахара указанное производителем на упаковке, но и то, что овощи, фрукты и т.д. изначально содержат определенное количество сахара.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Таким образом, общее количество сахара может оказаться значительно выше, чем указано на этикетке.</seg>

          <seg id="1">На референдуме в Новой Каледонии большинство проголосовало против независимости</seg>
          <seg id="2">В Новой Каледонии третий референдум, состоявшийся 12 декабря, завершился с тем же результатом, что и два предыдущих.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Согласно первым частичным результатам, объявленным в воскресенье, 12 декабря, в полдень, большинство жителей Новой Каледонии проголосовали во время референдума против независимости своей территории.</seg>
          <seg id="4">При этом уровень участия в этом третьем голосовании стал значительно ниже, чем в двух предыдущих.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Согласно предварительным результатам, опубликованным опубликованных местными властями, "за" независимость Новой Каледонии от Франции высказались 3,51% (2 755 человек) проголосовавших, тогда как 96,49% (75 762) проголосовали "против".</seg>
          <seg id="6">Явка составила 43,90%, всего в выборах приняли участие более 80 тыс. жителей Новой Каледонии.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Как комментирует эти промежуточные итоги агентство France-Presse, "исход этих выборов не оставлял места для сомнений", так как сторонники независимости призвали избирателей не участвовать в голосовании.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Являясь инициаторами проведения референдума, они выступили против его проведения 12 декабря, считая, что новая вспышка эпидемии COVID-19 на архипелаге мешает провести полноценную и "честную" предвыборную кампанию.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Таким образом, это неучастие открыло путь к третьей победе сторонников Французской Новой Каледонии, после референдумов, проведенных в ноябре 2018 и в октябре 2020 года.</seg>
          <seg id="10">В 2018 году против независимости проголосовали 56,7% жителей, в 2020 - 53,3%.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Как заявили сепаратисты, они не признают результатов последнего голосования и оспорят их в ООН.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Как сообщили в воскресенье, 12 декабря, в Елисейском дворце, президент Франции Эммануэль Макрон должен выступить по итогам этого референдума.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Тема независимости Новой Каледонии во многом оживила последние недели президентской кампании во Франции.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Несколько кандидатов в президенты высказались в пользу того, чтобы территория оставалась в составе Франции, так как это "последний регион присутствия Европейского Союза в Тихом океане".</seg>
          <seg id="15">"Новая Каледония обязательно должна оставаться французской", - неоднократно повторял Эрик Земмур.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Такое же заявление сделала кандидат от Республиканцев Валери Пекресс, которая в конце октября опубликовала колонку в Le Figaro, призывая каледонцев оставаться французами.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Со своей стороны, Эммануэль Макрон объявил в мае 2018 года, что не будет занимать позицию, "потому что это не его ответственность".</seg>
          <seg id="18">Тем не менее, президент добавил: "Франция была бы менее красивой без Новой Каледонии".</seg>
          <seg id="19">Премьер-министр Жан Кастекс, со своей стороны, выразил "сильное желание, чтобы выбор каледонцев был выбором Франции".</seg>

          <seg id="7">As France-Presse agency commented on these early results, the "outcome of the voting left no room for doubt", because independence supporters called on electors not to participate in voting.</seg>
          <seg id="8">While being the initiators of the referendum, they came out against holding it on December 12, considering that the new epidemic COVID-19 outbreak on the archipelago would hinder the implementation of a full and "honest" election campaign.</seg>

          <seg id="16">Valerie Pecresse, the Republican candidate, also supported this claim by publishing a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, where she urged Caledonians to remain French.</seg>
          <seg id="17">For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he will not take a stance "because it is not his responsibility."</seg>
          <seg id="18">At the same time, the President added: "France would not be as beautiful without New Caledonia".</seg>
          <seg id="19">In return, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced the "strong aspiration that the choice of Caledonians would become the choice of France".</seg>

          <seg id="3">Об этом 11 декабря сообщил внештатный советник главы офиса украинского президента Алексей Арестович.</seg>
          <seg id="4">То есть они способны действовать против воздушных объектов, против других беспилотников.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Даже против авиации пилотируемой.</seg>
          <seg id="6">На них будут украинские двигатели и остальная турецкая авионика: корпус и тому подобное", - цитирует его Диалог.ua.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Комментируя главные особенности аппаратов ANKA, Арестович рассказал, что речь идет о реактивных, а не поршневых БПЛА.</seg>
          <seg id="8">По его словам, это новое поколение беспилотников после Bayraktar, которые превышают его "по всем характеристикам".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Первая партия БПЛА должна быть произведена заводом в конце следующего года, заключил Арестович.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Летательный аппарат ANKA был создан Турецким аэрокосмическим агентством в феврале 2014 года.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Разработка беспилотника велась властями Турции в сотрудничестве с рядом частных компаний с 2010 года.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Накануне украинский генеральный штаб засекретил данные об использовании беспилотников Bayraktar и ракетных комплексов Javelin в ходе военных операций объединенных сил в Донбассе.</seg>
          <seg id="13">6 декабря президент Украины Владимир Зеленский сообщил, что в стране началось строительство завода по изготовлению современных военных беспилотников.</seg>

          <seg id="15">29 сентября компания Bayraktar Savunma и украинское минобороны заключили соглашение о строительстве в Киевской области центра, в котором будут проводить обучение персонала, а также испытания и обслуживание турецких БПЛА Bayraktar.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Специалисты предупредили об угрозе рака из-за витамина B9</seg>
          <seg id="2">Исследования свидетельствуют, что избыток витамина B9, также известного как фолиевая кислота, может привести к раку.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом предупредило издание Daily Express.</seg>
          <seg id="4">По мнению специалистов, имеются веские доказательства того, люди, не испытывающие недостатка фолиевой кислоты, меньше рискуют заболеть некоторыми видами рака, в частности, колоректальным.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Однако превышение необходимой дозы напротив способствует росту раковых клеток.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Профессор Университета Алабамы в Бирмингеме, диетолог Бет Китчин советует следить за количеством фолиевой кислоты, потребляемой в течение дня.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Оптимальная доза составляет 400 микрограммов в сутки.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Угроза рака повышается только в том случае, если существенно отклониться от этой цифры в большую или меньшую сторону.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Китчин рекомендует не принимать витамин B9 в таблетках без рекомендации врача, обязательно следить за дозировкой и избегать хлопья с молоком и другие пищевые продукты, которые содержат фолиевую кислоту.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Ранее консультант по питанию Рэйчел Файн назвала фолиевую кислоту веществом, которое замедляет старение.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Поскольку она, среди прочего, содержится в авокадо, Файн рекомендовала мужчинам после 50 лет чаще есть этот плод.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Studies show that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The Daily Express warned about this.</seg>
          <seg id="4">According to specialists, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal.</seg>
          <seg id="5">However, on the contrary, exceeding the required dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Nutritionist Ben Kitchin, Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises monitoring the amount of folic acid you consume throughout the day.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this number upward or downward.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk or other food that contains folic acid.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.</seg>
          <seg id="11">As it, among other things, is contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Прогнозы британских ученых показывают, что из-за распространения омикрон-штамма коронавируса в ближайшие пять месяцев в Англии могут умереть до 75 тыс. человек, если не ужесточать ограничительные меры зимой.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом сообщила газета The Guardian со ссылкой на исследование экспертов Лондонской школы гигиены и тропической медицины (LSHTM), передает ТАСС.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Согласно наиболее оптимистичному прогнозу специалистов, которые входят в состав научно-консультативной группы по чрезвычайным ситуациям при британском кабинете министров, к апрелю 2022 года в стране зафиксируют не менее 25 тыс. летальных исходов из-за штамма омикрон, а всего госпитализированы будут около 175 тыс. пациентов.</seg>
          <seg id="5">При этом на пике заболеваемости больницы будут принимать более 2 тыс. инфицированных ежедневно.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"Серьезные меры по борьбе с коронавирусом могут потребоваться, чтобы не допустить перегруженности Национальной службы здравоохранения, если омикрон-штамм окажется более заразным, чем вариант дельта, а действующие вакцины не смогут исключить заражения", - сказала математик Розанна Барнард из LSHTM.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ранее Агентство по безопасности в области здравоохранения Великобритании проинформировало: если скорость распространения омикрон-штамма сохранится на нынешнем уровне, то к концу года в стране будет выявлено около 1 млн случаев заражения.</seg>
          <seg id="8">При этом уже к середине декабря штамм омикрон может стать доминирующим в Соединенном Королевстве.</seg>
          <seg id="9">В настоящий момент в Великобритании обнаружено 1898 случаев заражения омикрон-штаммом коронавируса, из которых 633 были выявлены за последние сутки.</seg>
          <seg id="10">При этом 9 декабря глава британского Минздрава Саджид Джавид указал, что в реальности этот показатель может уже достигать 10 тыс. случаев.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Cпрос на суперяхты вырос в мире на четверть</seg>
          <seg id="2">Строительство суперяхт в этом году и заказы на следующий год бьют в мире все рекорды, несмотря на призывы сократить углеводородный след и борьбу с климатическими изменениями.</seg>
          <seg id="3">В мировом реестре судов количество заказанных яхт составило 1200 единиц - на четверть больше, чем в прошлом году.</seg>
          <seg id="4">В эру борьбы с последствиями изменения климата за сокращение эмиссий парниковых газов трудно представить, что количество людей, у которых есть желание и деньги на плавучую крепость за 50 миллионов долларов фунтов и выше, не будет уменьшаться, пишет "Гардиан".</seg>
          <seg id="5">Однако их становится все больше.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В этом году было заказано на 25% судов больше, чем в предыдущем.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Брокеры говорят, что такого ажиотажа на рынке не было 20 лет.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Первая причина в том, что многие, кто может позволить себе яхту, опасаются заражения на суше и предпочитаются скрыться от пандемии на борту собственного судна.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Вторая причина также связана с коронавирусом.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Если раньше все эти люди ходили в офис и встречались с партнерами по бизнесу лично, теперь абсолютное большинство из них работают удаленно, а переговоры проводят по зуму.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Брокер Уилл Кристи рассказал газете, что верфи принимают заказы на новые яхты на 2025 год и позже.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Это означает, что заказчики готовы платить больше, лишь бы их яхта была готова хотя бы на год или два раньше.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"Люди просто жаждут свободы, а супербогатые мог себе ее позволить", говорит он.</seg>
          <seg id="14">В западном обществе многие критикуют такое поведение богатых и называют его декадентским.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Богатые, говорят социологи, не хотят понять, что во времена лишений путешествия в космос, жизнь на яхтах или полеты на собственных самолетах вызывают в обществе раздражение, поскольку элита не хочет разделить ответственность за изменение климата со всем остальным человечеством.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Экономисты призывают правительства к действию и предлагают ввести для супербогатых новые налоги и правила, хотя они и понимают, что при такой мобильности денег, осуществить это будет крайне сложно.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Между тем, впечатляет только количество заказанных супер-яхт, но и их характеристики.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Из 1200 судов 27 имеют длину кормы выше 100 метров.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Норвежский миллиардер Рекке строит яхту REV Ocean длиной 183 метра.</seg>
          <seg id="20">После спуска на воду это будет самая большая яхта в мире.</seg>
          <seg id="21">На яхте предусмотрен "лунный бассейн", а также подводная лодка, предназначенная для изучения морских глубин.</seg>
          <seg id="22">На существующих супер-яхтах обычными стали площадки для вертолетов, кинотеатры под открытым небом, а на некоторых из них, как, например, на яхте борца МакГрегора - платформа для единоборств.Профессор экономической антропологии американского университета в Индиане Ричард Уилк говорит, что по сравнению с общим количеством выборосов парниковых газов, карбоновый след, производимый супербогатыми, незначителен.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Но он имеет символическое значение, если учесть, что мультимиллиардеров в мире чуть больше 2000 человек.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Это просто еще один пример сверхпотребления весьма малочисленной группы людей.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Ученые обнаружили, что эмиссионный след миллиардеров в тысячи раз больше следа среднестатистического жителя планеты.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Если один человек производит в среднем 5 тонн СО2 в год, то самый большой загрязнитель планеты Роман Абрамович ответственен за 33,9 тонны парниковых газов, попавших в атмосферу в 2018 году.</seg>
          <seg id="27">При этом две трети эмиссионного следа прихолились на его яхту Eclipse длиной 162,5 метра.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Даже если владельца на борту яхты нет, команда продолжает отравлять планету.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Владелец может позвонить капитану и дать команду пригнать яхту, например, из Средиземного моря в Карибское.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Владельцы суперяхт не вызывают сочувствия других людей, когда они, как самая богатая женщина Австралии Джина Райнхард, владеющая шахтами на континенте, жалуются через Ютуб, что для их гигантских судов нет места для причала.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Также трудно понять ее призыв строить марины для судов смыше 50 метров.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Worldwide demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter</seg>
          <seg id="2">Superyacht construction this year and orders for the next year hit all-time records around the world despite appeals to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.</seg>
          <seg id="3">According to the International Ship Registry, the number of yacht orders amounts to 1,200 vessels — a quarter more than in the previous year.</seg>
          <seg id="4">According to the "Guardian", in an era of combating the effects of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the means and appetite to build a floating fortress that costs 50 million dollars pounds or more will not fall.</seg>
          <seg id="5">However, their numbers are growing.</seg>
          <seg id="6">This year, the number of vessels ordered is 25% higher than in the previous one.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Brokers say that there has not been such a commotion on the market for 20 years.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are afraid to be infected onshore and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.</seg>
          <seg id="10">While all these people used to go to the office and meet their business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working remotely and meeting via Zoom.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.</seg>
          <seg id="12">This means that customers are ready to pay more so they can get their yachts at least one or two years earlier.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"People just yearn for freedom and the super-rich people can afford it," he says.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Many people in western society criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Sociologists say that wealthy people are not willing to understand that space travel, life on a yacht and private jet flights during times of distress stir up society, because the elites do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Economists call governments to action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, however they understand that this will be extremely hard to implement given the mobility of money.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their specifications.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The sterns of 27 out of 1,200 vessels are more than 100 meters in length.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Norwegian billionaire Rokke is building the 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.</seg>
          <seg id="20">After launch, she will become the biggest yacht in the world.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The yacht features a "moon pool" and a submarine to explore the sea depths.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Helipads and open-air cinemas are common for existing superyachts, but some of them, like, for example, wrestler McGregor's yacht, feature a fighting ring. Richard Wilk, professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana University, says that the carbon footprint left by the super-rich is negligible compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
          <seg id="23">But it has a symbolic value considering that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.</seg>
          <seg id="24">It is just another example of hyper-consumption by quite a small group of people.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Scientists discovered that the emission footprint left by billionaires is several thousand times bigger than the footprint left by an average inhabitant of the planet.</seg>
          <seg id="26">While a single person produces 5 tonnes of CO2 per year on average, the major contaminator of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.</seg>
          <seg id="27">By the way, two-thirds of the emission footprint was produced by his 162.5-meter-long yacht Eclipse.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Even when the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The owner may call the captain and order them to bring the yacht from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean Sea, for example.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Superyacht owners get no sympathy from other people when they complain on YouTube, like Gina Rinehart, Australia's richest woman Australia who owns mines on the continent, that there is no space to moor their giant vessels.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Also, it is difficult to understand her pleas to build marinas for more than 50-meter vessels.</seg>

          <seg id="4">Experts concluded that the use of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.</seg>
          <seg id="5">At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Moreover, moderately drunk men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.</seg>

          <seg id="3">По его мнению, Вашингтон и Москва в ближайшее время планируют продолжить переговоры по поводу гарантий Соединенных Штатов относительно того, что Украина не вступит в Североатлантический альянс, несмотря на слова американского лидера Джо Байдена о праве стран "вступать куда угодно".</seg>

          <seg id="2">Передовые китайские технологии привлекли внимание компаний из США, Германии, Франции и других стран на Китайской международной выставке рельсового транспорта и производства оборудования 2021 года, проходившей в городе Чжучжоу провинции Хунань /Центральный Китай/.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Основные технологии, разработанные компанией CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., позволяют поездам автоматически выявлять и диагностировать технические неисправности, отметил представитель компании Хоу Чжаовэнь.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Высокоскоростные поезда, курсирующие по железнодорожной линии Китай-Лаос, которая была введена в эксплуатацию в начале этого месяца, уже оснащены данными технологиями, что обеспечит повышенную надежность и работоспособность подвижного состава.</seg>
          <seg id="5">За последние шесть месяцев Китай значительно увеличил экспорт железнодорожных транспортных средств и многие страны Азии и Европы становятся свидетелями "китайской скорости".</seg>
          <seg id="6">В мае этого года с производственной линии компании CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd сошли первые разработанные в Китае двухэтажные скоростные электропоезда, предназначенные для экспорта в Европу.</seg>
          <seg id="7">С максимальной рабочей скоростью 200 километров в час эти поезда будут курсировать по железным дорогам Австрии, Германии, Венгрии и других европейских стран.</seg>
          <seg id="8">В ноябре началась пробная эксплуатация поезда метро, разработанного вышеназванной компанией для Турции.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Поезд будет двигаться по линии метрополитена, соединяющей центр Стамбула с аэропортом города.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Движение по этой линии метро будет открыто в следующем году.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Это будет самая быстрая линия метро в Турции со скоростью 120 километров в час.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Китайская индустрия по производству оборудование для железнодорожного транспорта является одной из отраслей с самым высоким уровнем инноваций и самой сильной международной инновационной конкурентоспособностью", - сказал Фэн Яосян, глава торгово-инвестиционного департамента Китайского комитета содействия развитию международной торговли /ККСРМТ/.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"Эта отрасль составляет основное конкурентное преимущество китайского производства высококлассного оборудования на мировом рынке", - сказал Фэн Яосян.</seg>
          <seg id="14">После более чем 60 лет напряженной работы, проведя ряд независимых исследований и разработок, Китай создал передовую систему производства оборудования для железнодорожного транспорта, с полным комплексом вспомогательных средств и с крупномасштабной производственной деятельностью.</seg>
          <seg id="15">По словам Фэн Яосяна, страна занимает первое место по уровню электрификации железных дорог и по эксплуатационному пробегу на высокоскоростных и городских железных дорогах.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Кандидат биологических наук Семен Голошейкин в беседе с радио Sputnik перечислил ранние признаки деменции.</seg>
          <seg id="3">По его словам, признаками будущей деменции могут быть забывчивость, а также целый ряд умеренных когнитивных нарушений, таких как неспособность к концентрации, планированию, снижение уровня абстрактного мышления.</seg>
          <seg id="4">В настоящее время ведется дискуссия о том, что потеря слуха может быть как ранним проявлением болезни Альцгеймера, так и одним из факторов риска ее возникновения, сказал специалист.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Голошейкин подчеркнул, что причинами деменции могут быть нейродегенеративные расстройства, травмы головы, некоторые инфекции, метаболические нарушения, нехватка определенных витаминов.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Он добавил, что болезнь Альцгеймера и атеросклероз сосудов головного мозга являются наиболее частыми причинами возникновения этого синдрома.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Биолог отметил, что на сегодняшний день медики не знают действенных способов лечения деменции.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Поэтому необходимо вовремя начинать ее профилактику.</seg>
          <seg id="9">По его словам, снизить риск развития деменции поможет изучение иностранных языков и активное общение.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Также ВОЗ рекомендует поддерживать умеренный уровень физической нагрузки, регулярно тренировать когнитивные навыки с помощью игр и хобби, которые требуют интенсивного вовлечения памяти и логики мышления</seg>
          <seg id="11">"Существуют рекомендации по применению различных БАДов, однако их эффективность и целесообразность все еще дискутируются в научном сообществе", - сказал Голошейкин.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Всемирная организация здравоохранения рекомендует поддержание умеренного уровня физической нагрузки, регулярную тренировку когнитивных навыков и способностей с помощью игр и хобби, требующих интенсивного вовлечения памяти и логики мышления", - сказал Голошейкин.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Ранее благотворительная организация по исследованию деменции в Великобритании заявила, что болезнь все чаще поражает людей в возрасте от 40 лет.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Медики назвали ранние симптомы болезни Альцгеймера.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Первым тревожным знаком можно считать проблемы со зрением, из-за которого пациент приобретает сложности в распознаванием объектов.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Еще одним признаком развивающегося слабоумия специалисты назвали афазию - состояние, когда человек не может найти правильные слова, чтобы передать то, что он хочет сказать.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Semen Golosheykin, PhD in Biology, listed the early signs of dementia in his interview with Radio Sputnik.</seg>
          <seg id="3">According to him, the early signs of dementia may include forgetfulness and a range of moderate cognitive disorders, such as difficulty concentrating, planning and deterioration in abstract thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Currently, there are ongoing debates that hearing loss may also serve both as an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of its risk factors, according to the specialist.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Golosheykin pointed out that dementia may be caused by neurodegenerative diseases, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and deficiency of certain vitamins.</seg>
          <seg id="6">He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most frequent causes of this syndrome.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The biologist noted that currently, healthcare professionals are unaware of an effective dementia treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Therefore, timely prevention is recommended.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to him, learning foreign languages and active socializing help reduce the risk of dementia.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The WHO also recommends moderate physical activity and regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive engagement of memory and logical thinking</seg>
          <seg id="11">"There are recommendations to take various dietary supplements; however, their effectiveness and suitability are still being discussed in the academic community," said Golosheykin.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"The World Health Organization recommends moderate physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive engagement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Earlier, a UK dementia research charity stated that the disease increasingly strikes people in their 40s.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Healthcare professionals listed early signs of Alzheimer's disease.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Problems with vision may be considered as the first warning sign due to which the patient develops difficulty in recognizing objects.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Specialists listed another sign of developing dementia — aphasia, or a condition where a person fails to find the right words to express what he wants to say.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Holoshekin in an interview with Radio Satellite listed early signs of dementia.</seg>
          <seg id="3">According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgotten, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduce abstract thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, the expert said.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Glochekin stressed that the causes of dementia may be non-generative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, shortage of certain vitamins.</seg>
          <seg id="6">He added that Alzheimer's disease and brain vessel atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The biologist noted that to date doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It is therefore necessary to start preventing it in time.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to him, the risk of dementia development will help learning foreign languages and active communication.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Also, WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic</seg>
          <seg id="11">"There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still discussed in the scientific community," said Gloshekin.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies requiring intensive memory and thinking logic", said Gloshekin.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Previously, a charitable dementia research organization in Britain stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Medicines called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The first disturbing sign can be considered visual problems, due to which the patient becomes complex in the recognition of objects.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Another sign of developing weaknesses, specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to pass on what he wants to say.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Олимпиада должна привлечь на склоны миллионы людей и помочь создать в стране курорты международного уровня</seg>
          <seg id="3">В Китае надеются, что Олимпиада не только привлечет 300 млн граждан к занятиям зимними видами спорта, что позволит собрать обозначенный президентом Си Цзиньпином 1 трлн юаней, но и поспособствует экономическому развитию отсталых отдаленных провинций.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Горнолыжный курорт Тайву в Чжанцзякоу, расположенный недалеко от места проведения зимних Олимпийских игр, становится все более популярным у китайцев.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Кроме строительства инфраструктуры в регионе проводятся и работы по озеленению: рабочие сажают деревья.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В стране насчитывается более 700 горнолыжных курортов, однако лишь 20 из них достаточно крупные, чтобы принять соревнования международного уровня.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Во многих регионах Китая, где расположены курорты, в том числе и в Чжанцзякоу, бывают проблемы со снегом.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Главная задача на долгосрочную перспективу - обеспечить комфортный и интересный отдых на китайских курортах, чтобы все новички становились завсегдатаями.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Однако до этого еще далеко.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Советник по организации Игр Джастин Даунс говорит, что с последнего его визита в 2007 году китайская лыжная индустрия изменилась до неузнаваемости.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Ежегодно зимой на склоны отправляется все больше китайцев.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Фиона, сноубордистка из Пекина, одна из них.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Несмотря на серьезные изменения, потребуются еще многие годы, чтобы создать здесь горнолыжную культуру, считает Даунс.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Многие курорты находятся в сельскохозяйственных и горнодобывающих районах.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Эти регионы еще предстоит активно развивать и создавать там необходимую для отдыха инфраструктуру.</seg>
          <seg id="16">70-летний Гао Маконг живет в Чунли, недалеко от мест проведения зимних Олимпийских игр.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Он отмечает, что в последние годы здесь наблюдается бум зимнего спортивного туризма.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Два года назад из Пекина в Чунли провели скоростную железную дорогу, теперь ни один из местных жителей не страдает без работы.</seg>
          <seg id="19">В стране открывается все больше магазинов, торгующих одеждой и снаряжением для зимних видов спорта.</seg>
          <seg id="20">На склонах открывают точки общепита с блюдами национальной кухни.</seg>
          <seg id="21">На Тайву теперь есть даже станция тестирования на COVID-19.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Китай стремится создать процветающую индустрию зимних видов спорта, его спортсмены должны стать лидерами крупнейших международных состязаний, а курорты и оборудование - достичь мирового уровня.</seg>

          <seg id="12">One of them is Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Downes believes that, despite some substantial changes, it will take many more years to establish a ski culture here.</seg>

          <seg id="15">These regions still need to be actively developed, and need the infrastructure for recreation.</seg>

          <seg id="3">В связи с отмечаемым 12 декабря Международным днем всеобщего охвата услугами здравоохранения ВОЗ и ВБ опубликовали два взаимодополняющих доклада.</seg>
          <seg id="4">В них они констатировали, что пандемия привела к сбоям в оказании медуслуг, вызвала чрезмерное напряжение в системах охраны здоровья.</seg>
          <seg id="5">В этой связи впервые за 10 лет снизился охват населения иммунизацией, выросла смертность от туберкулеза и малярии.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В ВОЗ и ВБ подчеркнули, что пандемия вызвала "наихудший экономический кризис с 1930-х годов, поэтому людям стало труднее платить за лечение".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Эта ситуация толкает более 500 миллионов человек "в крайнюю бедность, потому что им приходится платить за эти услуги из своего кармана".</seg>
          <seg id="8">В октябре генеральный секретарь ООН Антониу Гутерриш заявил, что пандемия коронавируса ввергла в нищету более 100 миллионов человек, более четырех миллиардов человек практически не имеют социальной поддержки.</seg>

          <seg id="2">More than 500 million people worldwide could crash into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic that slowed down the progress of universal health coverage for humanity, declared the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).</seg>
          <seg id="3">On the occasion of International Universal Health Coverage Day celebrated on December 12, the WHO and WB published two complementary reports.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In these reports, they stated that the pandemic led to interruptions in healthcare services and caused extra stress within the healthcare systems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In this regard, the scope of vaccination has been reduced and fatality rates related to tuberculosis and malaria have increased for the first time in 10 years.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became harder for people to pay for treatment."</seg>
          <seg id="7">This situation pushes over 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they are forced to pay for these services out of their pockets."</seg>
          <seg id="8">In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people are virtually devoid of social support.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Выступление министра цифровых технологий Тайваня Одри Тан на панельной дискуссии во время организованного США "Саммита за демократию" было переведено в режим без видео, свидетельствует запись саммита на YouTube.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Агентство Reuters со ссылкой на источники утверждает, что картинка была отключена по запросу Белого дома.</seg>
          <seg id="4">По их сообщению, причиной послужила карта, на которой Тайвань был выделен отдельным цветом от КНР, считающей остров своей территорией.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Карта, которую показывала госпожа Тан, была составлена южноафриканской неправительственной организацией CIVICUS и ранжировала страны мира по степени обеспечения гражданских прав.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Тайвань был выделен на ней зеленым как "свободный", а КНР, КНДР, Лаос и Вьетнам - красным, как "закрытые".</seg>
          <seg id="7">После того как министр показала карту, картинка с ее стороны была заменена на скриншот с примечанием, что мнения участников дискуссии "не обязательно выражают позицию правительства США".</seg>
          <seg id="8">КНР не была приглашена на "Саммит за демократию".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Источники Reuters отмечают, что карта, которую продемонстрировала тайваньский министр, могла идти вразрез с политикой "одного Китая", которой придерживается Вашингтон.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Один из источников агентства заявил, что после демонстрации карты Совет по национальной безопасности США гневно связался с Госдепартаментом, обвиняя его в том, что тот показал Тайвань отдельной страной.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Организованный Вашингтоном "Саммит за демократию" прошел с 9 по 10 декабря с участием представителей 110 стран и территорий, а также гражданских объединений и благотворительных организаций.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Россию на саммит не приглашали.</seg>
          <seg id="13">В ходе "нулевого дня" саммита лауреат Нобелевской премии мира, главный редактор "Новой газеты" Дмитрий Муратов призвал создать международный фонд, через который бы деньги, добытые посредством коррупции, отдавались на благотворительность.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Ранее сегодня заместитель секретаря Совбеза РФ Юрий Аверьянов заявил, что саммит нес "антироссийский и антикитайский заряд".</seg>

          <seg id="2">Пружинный ортопедический матрас ОК Базис – это одна из самых доступных по стоимости моделей в линейке.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Практичный наполнитель Баланс Фоам даёт матрасу все необходимые ортопедические свойства, но при этом оставляет цену на бюджетном уровне.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Данное изделие представляет собой оптимальное сочетание цены и качества.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Пена Баланс – это современный материал, который получают из ППУ.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Наполнитель отличается гипоаллергенностью и безопасностью.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Именно поэтому пену широко используют в промышленности.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Её безвредность и надёжность подтверждены специальным сертификатом, полученным в Европе, где такие требования значительно жёстче российских.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Ещё одно важное качество Баланс Фоам – это её ортопедичность: материал поддерживает правильное положение человека на протяжении всего времени сна.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Благодаря пене матрас приобрёл жёсткость ниже среднего уровня, поэтому изделие считается производителем достаточно мягким.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Основным несущим блоком в матрасе выступает SuperSprings.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Он примечателен содержанием независимых пружин, здесь расположилось сразу 256 элементов на квадратный метр.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Практичный блок выдерживает вес до 100 кг на спальное место, распределяет нагрузку и адаптирует поверхность под спящего, усиливая ортопедические качества пены.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Производитель предоставляет возможность выбора между пружинным блоком высотой 12 см и 18 см без изменения финальной стоимости.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Обязательно укажите свои предпочтения при заказе оператору магазина.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Матрас поставляется в трикотажном чехле, вместе с ним высота модели составляет 21 см.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Чехол несъемный.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The OK Basis spring orthopedic mattress is one of the most affordable models in this product line.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Its Balance Foam practical filler provides the mattress with all necessary orthopedic properties, while keeping the price affordable.</seg>
          <seg id="4">This product offers the optimal trade-off between price and quality.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Balance Foam is a modern material made from PU foam.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The filler is hypoallergenic and safe.</seg>
          <seg id="7">This is why it is widely used across the industry.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Its safety and reliability are confirmed by a special certificate received in Europe, where such requirements are much stricter than in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Another important feature of Balance Foam is its orthopedic function: the material keeps the person in the right position throughout the entire sleeping time.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Thanks to this foam, the firmness of the mattress became less than medium, which is why the manufacturer considers this product to be rather soft.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The mattress is based on the SuperSprings spring unit.</seg>
          <seg id="12">It is notable for its independent springs, with as many as 256 elements per square meter.</seg>
          <seg id="13">This practical unit supports weight of up to 100 kg per sleeping area, distributes the load, and adapts the surface to the sleeper, reinforcing the foam's orthopedic properties.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The manufacturer offers both 12-cm and 18-cm high spring units as options without changing the final price.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Please indicate your preference when placing an order with the store's operator.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The mattress comes in a fabric cover; together with it, the model is 21 cm high.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The cover cannot be removed.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The orthopedic foam used for the mattress has CertiPUR certification.</seg>

          <seg id="2">У привившихся назальной вакциной от COVID-19 может возникнуть аллергия и им понадобиться помощь медиков, поэтому первые пункты для прививания этим препаратом не стоит организовывать в аэропортах и торговых центрах.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом сообщил ТАСС вирусолог, член-корреспондент РАН, завлабораторией бионанотехнологии, микробиологии и вирусологии Новосибирского государственного университета Сергей Нетесов.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Организовать пункты вакцинации назальной вакциной в аэропортах и торговых центрах проще, но я бы это делал на первых порах только в медицинских учреждениях.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Дело в том, что вероятность возникновения аллергической реакции на такую вакцину имеется, она невелика, но желательно, чтобы человек после этого посидел рядом с кабинетом врача.</seg>
          <seg id="6">У врачей есть специальные наборы противоаллергических препаратов, которые действуют буквально через минуту-две, что иногда бывает очень нужно", - заявил Нетесов.</seg>
          <seg id="7">По мнению вирусолога, подумать о вакцинации в торговых центрах можно будет тогда, когда будет накоплен опыт в использовании препарата.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Он также подчеркнул, что при использовании назальной вакцины важно, чтобы она попала на слизистую оболочку в носовой полости.</seg>
          <seg id="9">При этом, существует вероятность, что вакцина не достигнет места назначения, если прививаемый при заложенности носа высморкается после впрыскивания.</seg>

          <seg id="4">Organizing nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would do this only in medical institutions at first.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The reason is the risk of allergic reactions, though minor, but it is desirable that the person sit by the doctor's office for a while afterwards.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Doctors have special allergy relief kits that are effective in just a minute or two, which is sometimes crucial," says Netesov.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to the virologist, one could think about vaccination at shopping malls after experience of using the medicine is accumulated.</seg>
          <seg id="8">He has also highlighted that it is important for a nasal vaccine to contact the nasal cavity during use.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Here, there is a probability that the vaccine will not reach the target if the patient blows the nose if congested after spraying.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Those vaccinated with the COVID-19 nasal vaccine may develop allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.</seg>
          <seg id="3">This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It is easier to organize vaccination points with nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sits next to the doctor's office.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is gained.</seg>
          <seg id="8">He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.</seg>
          <seg id="9">At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nasal congestion vaccine fades after injection.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Согласно окончательным результатам третьего референдума о независимости Новой Каледонии, подавляющее большинство участников отказались выходить из состава Франции.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом 12 декабря сообщил французский телеканал BFM.TV.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Против независимости высказались 96,5% проголосовавших.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Поддержали независимость от Франции 3,51% жителей архипелага на юге Тихого океана.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Аннулировали результаты 2,99% бюллетеней.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Уровень участия в голосовании в этот день был очень низким: на участки пришли около 55% жителей архипелага.</seg>
          <seg id="8">По мнению экспертов, низкая явка объясняется призывами сепаратистов отказаться от участия в референдуме из-за коронавируса.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Париж отказался переносить дату референдума.</seg>
          <seg id="10">В октябре 2020 года года жители Новой Каледонии на референдуме высказались против независимости от Франции.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В 2018 году в регионе уже проводился референдум по вопросу независимости.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Большинство жителей поддержали нахождение архипелага в составе Франции.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Новая Каледония находится почти в 20 тыс. километров от материковой Франции.</seg>
          <seg id="14">В 1853 году Франция объявила Новую Каледонию своим владением.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Проживают на архипелаге около 270 тыс. человек, территория наделена особым административно-территориальным статусом.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Между Парижем и администрацией Новой Каледонии действует соглашение 1998 года, согласно которому регион может организовывать голосование о своей независимости два раза с разницей в два года.</seg>

          <seg id="5">"Предварительные данные и значительно измененный антигенный профиль белка штамма "омикрон" позволяют предположить снижение эффективности вакцины против инфекции и передачи варианта.</seg>
          <seg id="6">По предварительным выводам из ЮАР предполагается, что она ("тяжесть заболевания" - ред.) может быть менее менее тяжелой, чем при "дельте"", - говорится в техническом сообщении ВОЗ.</seg>

          <seg id="1">На Украине назвали четыре сценария для Зеленского</seg>
          <seg id="2">Экс-депутат Верховной рады Вадим Денисенко перечислил четыре варианта развития событий для президента Украины Владимира Зеленского в 2022 году.</seg>
          <seg id="3">По его мнению, глава государства может остаться без поддержки Запада, а также, возможно, пойдет на компромиссы по Донбассу.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Об этом в воскресенье, 12 декабря, Денисенко рассказал в публикации на портале "Главред".</seg>
          <seg id="5">Первый вариант, который Денисенко назвал "идеальным штормом", предполагает, что Украину перестанут поддерживать ключевые западные страны, достигнув договоренности о будущем страны без ее участия.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Такое развитие событий будет способствовать глубокому кризису, с которым Киев может столкнуться в 2023 году.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Параллельно происходит уменьшение цен на ключевые товары, которые мы традиционно экспортируем &lt;...&gt; внутренние протесты и противостояние власти с ключевыми ФПГ (финансово-промышленными группами. - Ред.) ", - добавил экс-парламентарий.</seg>
          <seg id="8">По словам Денисенко, существует и другой сценарий развития ситуации - "война против всех".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Данный прогноз сбудется в случае высокой турбулентности в мировой политике, при которой украинские власти столкнутся с рядом проблем.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Из-за такого положения дел руководство Украины может пойти на компромиссы по Донбассу, в результате которых возможно противостояние внутри страны.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В конце лета позиции Зеленского ослабнут, вероятность такой ситуации, по словам бывшего нардепа, составляет до 50-55%.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Третий вариант развития ситуации в украинской политике - противостояние несогласных с Зеленским групп населения и президента, из-за чего вероятен захват контроля над силовым блоком и реализация "популистских инициатив".</seg>
          <seg id="13">В ходе такого варианта кризиса Зеленский начнет "переформатирование власти", добавил Денисенко.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Еще один сценарий - превращение Зеленского в "отца нации".</seg>
          <seg id="15">К этому может привести некое событие, которое станет сильным потрясением для общества.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"Событие должно быть достаточно масштабным для того, чтобы вызвать реакцию у внешних партнеров и привести к увеличению поддержки Украины", - сказал Денисенко.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Такой вариант развития ситуации возможен в результате стихийного бедствия, техногенной катастрофы или агрессивных действий России, считает экс-депутат.</seg>
          <seg id="18">При этом российская сторона уже не один раз отвергла любые вероятности "нападения" на Украину.</seg>
          <seg id="19">В Москве отмечали, что именно украинские власти, НАТО и США увеличивают военную активность у российских границ.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Ранее, 11 ноября, данные опроса социологической группы "Рейтинг" показали, что рейтинг украинского президента упал до рекордно низких значений, составив 19,3%.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Это является самым низким показателем с момента избрания его главой государства.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Аналитики спрогнозировали ситуацию, при которой в случае ближайших выборов президента Украины за Зеленского отдали бы свой голос всего 21,8%, тогда как за экс-президента страны Петра Порошенко - 14,5%.</seg>
          <seg id="23">При этом среди всех опрошенных поддержку президенту выразили только 19,3%.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Four scenarios for Zelenskyy identified in Ukraine</seg>
          <seg id="2">Vadim Denisenko, a former member of the Verkhovna Rada, listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2022.</seg>
          <seg id="3">According to him, the state's leader could lose support from the West and possibly agree to make compromises over Donbas.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Denisenko shared his opinion in a publication on the Glavred portal on Sunday, December 12.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The first possibility, dubbed "the perfect storm" by Denisenko, is Ukraine losing support from key Western countries that would come to an agreement regarding the country's future without its involvement.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Such a turn of events would contribute to a serious crisis that Kyiv could face in 2023.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"At the same time, the prices for critical goods that we traditionally export fall &lt;...&gt;, and there are internal protests and adversity between the government and FIG (financial and industrial groups — Ed.)," added the former official.</seg>
          <seg id="8">According to Denisenko, there is also another scenario — "war against everyone."</seg>
          <seg id="9">This prediction will come true in the event of highly turbulent world politics causing a number of problems for the Ukrainian government.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This situation might force Ukraine's leadership to compromise on Donbas, which could lead to a conflict within the country.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In late summer, Zelenskyy's standing will weaken; according to the ex-deputy, this situation has a 50–55% chance of occurring.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The third possible scenario for Ukrainian politics is a conflict between those groups of people who disagree with Zelenskyy and the president, which may result in the seizure of control over the security wing, and the implementation of "populist initiatives."</seg>
          <seg id="13">Under this crisis scenario, Zelenskyy will start "reformatting power," added Denisenko.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Yet another scenario is Zelenskyy's transformation into the "father of the nation."</seg>
          <seg id="15">This could be caused by an event that will deliver a severe shock to society.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"The event must be large enough to elicit a reaction from international partners and encourage increased support for Ukraine," added Denisenko.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The ex-deputy believes that this scenario could materialize as a result of a natural or man-made disaster, or Russia's aggressive actions.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Russia itself has more than once dismissed any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Moscow says it is the Ukrainian government, NATO and the U.S. who are increasing the level of military activity near Russia's borders.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Earlier, on November 11, survey data from the sociological group Rating showed that the Ukrainian president's popularity hit an all-time low of 19.3%.</seg>
          <seg id="21">This is the lowest it has been since his election as the head of state.</seg>
          <seg id="22">According to the predictions of analysts, in the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelenskyy and 14.5% for the country's former president Petro Poroshenko.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Notably, only 19.3% of all survey's participants expressed their support for the president.</seg>

          <seg id="1">In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky</seg>
          <seg id="2">The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2002.</seg>
          <seg id="3">In his view, the Head of State may remain without the support of the West, as well as perhaps a compromise on the Donbass.</seg>
          <seg id="4">This on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in the publication on the portal "Glavred".</seg>
          <seg id="5">The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching agreement on the future without its participation.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Such developments will contribute to the profound crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"In parallel, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export "..." internal protests and confrontation of power with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups...)" added ex-parliamentarians.</seg>
          <seg id="8">According to Denisenko, there is also another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".</seg>
          <seg id="9">This forecast will be expected in the event of high turbulence in world politics, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Because of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine can compromise on the Donbas, as a result of which the internal confrontation may be possible.</seg>
          <seg id="11">At the end of summer Zelensky position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50-5%.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of disagreements with the Green Groups and the President, which is believed to take control of the force bloc and implement "populist initiatives".</seg>
          <seg id="13">During this variant of the crisis Zelensky will start "reforming power", Denisenko added.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into a "father of the nation".</seg>
          <seg id="15">This can lead to a certain event that will become a strong shock for society.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"The event should be sufficiently large in order to cause reactions from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine", Denisenko said.</seg>
          <seg id="17">This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic disaster or aggressive action by Russia, the former deputy considers.</seg>
          <seg id="18">At the same time, the Russian side has not once rejected any probability of "attack" on Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that increase military activity at the Russian borders.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Earlier, November 11, the survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low value of 19.3%.</seg>
          <seg id="21">This is the lowest indicator since his head of State was elected.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Analysts predicted a situation in which only 21.8% would vote in the event of the immediate elections of the President of Ukraine for Zelensky, while 14.5% for former President Petro Poroshenko.</seg>
          <seg id="23">At the same time, only 19.3 per cent of the President's support was expressed among all interviewed.</seg>

          <seg id="2">В начале недели на десять суток арестовали 21-летнего поэта Александра Волченкова.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Студент ВШЭ был задержан на Красной площади с плакатом, на котором был написан хэштег #поэтвроссиибольшечемпоэт.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Это цитата принадлежит писателю Евгению Евтушенко.</seg>
          <seg id="5">На Александра был составлен протокол по административной статье о повторном нарушении порядка проведения публичной акции.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Первый раз он был задержан 23 января на Пушкинской площади, на митинге в поддержку Алексея Навального.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Цель была в привлечении внимания к поэзии в целом, сейчас интерес к ней, к сожалению, утрачен, к упадку культуры общей в России и так же небольшая надежда вдохновить неизвестных поэтов писать в интернете свои стихи под этим хэштегом", - объясняет Александр.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Мы связались с молодым поэтом, чтобы выяснить обстоятельства задержания и более подробно раскрыть месседж его послания.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Как с вами при задержании обращались сотрудники полиции в этот раз и ранее?</seg>
          <seg id="10">Что спрашивали в отделе, как комментировали вашу акцию?</seg>
          <seg id="11">В этот раз сотрудники были корректнее, задержание максимально, вежливое, как бы смешно это не звучало в некотором контексте этого слова.</seg>
          <seg id="12">На Пушкинской брали ОМОНовцы и брали жестко.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Спрашивали стандартно, о мотивах.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Когда услышали, в принципе, посмотрели если не одобряюще, то понимающе.</seg>
          <seg id="15">За исключением продуваемого на все 4 стороны обезьянника все было предельно корректно, но я знал, на что шел.</seg>
          <seg id="16">И если после акции под этим хэштегом начнут писать свои стихи, хотя бы несколько человек, я эти 10 суток отсижу не зря.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Earlier this week, Alexander Volchenkov, a 21-year-old poet, was arrested for ten days.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The HSE student was detained in Red Square with a banner, which had the #apoetinrussiaismorethanapoet hashtag written on it.</seg>
          <seg id="4">This is a quote from the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.</seg>
          <seg id="5">A report was drawn up for Alexander on the grounds of repeatedly violating the rules of public protests, which is an administrative offense.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexey Navalny.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole — now, regrettably, it has lost its appeal; to highlight the overall decline of culture in Russia; there was also a bit of hope to inspire unknown poets to post their poetry online with this hashtag," explains Alexander.</seg>
          <seg id="8">We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and study his message in more detail.</seg>
          <seg id="9">How did the police officers treat you this time and before during detention?</seg>
          <seg id="10">What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your act?</seg>
          <seg id="11">This time the employees were more tactful, the detention was as polite as possible, however funny this sounds in a certain context of this word.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In Pushkin Street, the OMON officers took and took in a tough way.</seg>
          <seg id="13">They asked in a typical way about the motives.</seg>
          <seg id="14">When they heard, they basically looked with understanding, if not with appreciation.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Except for the police lockup being breezy on all 4 sides, everything was as proper as possible, but I knew what I was signing up for.</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if after the act at least several people start writing their poetry under this hashtag, I won't sit through these 10 days in vain.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Исследование показало, что картофель богат витаминами и микроэлементами, которые способствуют улучшению кровообращения и снижению уровня холестерина.</seg>
          <seg id="3">В корнеплоде содержатся витамины группы В, витамин С, фосфор, калий, магний, рибофлавин, фолиевая и пантотеновая кислоты.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Все эти элементы помогают функционировать системам организма.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Кроме того, картофель помогает в борьбе с возрастными нарушениями.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Благодаря большому содержанию клечатки он полезен для желудочно-кишечного тракта, а при регулярном употреблении может также помочь в профилактике гипертонии и атеросклероза.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Однако для наибольшей пользы корнеплод лучше тушить или варить, а не жарить на масле.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Ранее издание The Daily Express предупредило, что картофель может быть опасен для диабетиков, как и другие продукты с высоким гликемическим показателем.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Это продукты с содержанием углеводов, которые быстро расщепляются на сахара, такие как сахар, сладкие безалкогольные напитки, белый рис, и белый хлеб.</seg>

          <seg id="5">Moreover, potatoes help fight age-associated disorders.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Ортопедический пружинный матрас Микро Ультимейт.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Модель удобна тем, что имеет две различные по мягкости поверхности – высокой жёсткости и чуть больше среднего.</seg>
          <seg id="4">В состав изделия включены только качественные и премиальные наполнители, которые зарекомендовали себя исключительно с лучшей стороны.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Пружины: в центре модели установлен блок независимых пружин "микропакет".</seg>
          <seg id="6">Это значит, что на спальное место приходится 2000 спиралей, которые работают полностью автономно.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Именно их функционирование даёт уникальную точечную подстройку.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Микропакет" является самым высокочастотным из всего многообразия пружинных блоков "Димакса", поэтому обладает ярко выраженным ортопедическим эффектом и считается премиальным.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Наполнители: сверху и снизу от пружин установлены комбинации из слоёв койры и натурального латекса.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Единственное отличие – это порядок плит.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Если у одной поверхности лежит латекс, то у другой – кокосовая койра.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Такой тандем наполнителей уже давно несёт статус классического, поскольку передаёт матрасу не только ортопедические, но и анатомические свойства.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Если койра обеспечивает правильную поддержку спины, то латекс даёт адаптацию поверхности под тело человека.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Чехол: модель поставляется в простёганном трикотажном чехле Aloe Vera.</seg>
          <seg id="15">По желанию клиента его можно сделать как съёмным, так и стационарным.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Общая высота изделия – 27 см, рекомендованная нагрузка на спальное место – 170 кг.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Гарантия и безопасность: гарантийный период – 3 года.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Матрас получил все необходимые сертификаты и документы, которые подтверждают его полную безопасность и надёжность в эксплуатации.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Ортопедическая пена, которая используется в матрасе, имеет сертификат CertiPUR.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Their functioning is what provides the unique point adjustment.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Micropackage is the highest frequency of all Dimax pocket spring units, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Fillers: combinations of coir and natural latex layers are placed on the top and bottom of the springs.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The only difference is the order of the slabs.</seg>
          <seg id="11">If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Such a tandem of fillers has long borne a classic status, because it gives the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomic properties.</seg>

          <seg id="14">Cover: the model is supplied in a quilted knitted Aloe Vera cover.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It can be made either removable or fixed at the customer's request.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Total product height — 27 cm, recommended load per sleeping area — 170 kg.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Массачусетский технологический институт в сотрудничестве с Тартуской обсерваторией и другими исследовательскими учреждениями и компаниями готовит три космические миссии к Венере для поиска признаков жизни в атмосфере, сообщила в воскресенье "Актуальная камера".</seg>
          <seg id="3">Цель стартующих через пять лет миссий - оценка пригодности для жизни облаков Венеры, а затем поиск там жизни.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Для проекта тартуские ученые предложили инструменты для измерения кислотности и содержания кислорода в облаках Венеры.</seg>
          <seg id="5">До сих пор предполагалось, что облака Венеры, ближайшей к Земле планеты, слишком кислотные, чтобы там могла существовать жизнь, но вероятно, изначально Венера была планетой земного типа.</seg>
          <seg id="6">В ходе третьей миссии должна прибыть проба с Венеры.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Предположим, что если мы найдем там жизнь, то основным вопросом станет - похожа ли она на земную или же отличается.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Если очень похожа, то будет очевидно, что земная жизнь не началась на Земле.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Если же отличается, то возможно, более вероятным станет то, что жизнь зародилась на Земле", - рассказал руководитель эстонской команды проекта "Venus Life Finder" Михкель Паюсалу.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Estonian scientists will be looking for life on Venus</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies are preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the planet's atmosphere, reported Aktualnaya Kamera on Sunday.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The goal of the missions that are to be launched in five years is to assess the habitability of Venusian clouds and then to look for life there.</seg>
          <seg id="4">For the project, the Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Until now, it was believed that the clouds of Venus, which is the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic to sustain life, but Venus was probably an Earth-like planet originally.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A sample should be brought from Venus during the third mission.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Assuming we discover life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to that on Earth or if it is in fact different.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If it is very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not originate on Earth.</seg>
          <seg id="9">If, however, it differs, it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, the head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder team.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venice to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday the "Actual Chamber".</seg>
          <seg id="3">The aim of the five-year missions is to evaluate the suitability for the life of the Venice clouds and then search for life there.</seg>
          <seg id="4">For the project, Tartu scientists offered tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in Venice clouds.</seg>
          <seg id="5">To date, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venice, nearest to the Earth of the planet, are too acid to exist there, but probably originally Venice was a planet of earth type.</seg>
          <seg id="6">During the third mission, the sample should arrive with Venice.</seg>
          <seg id="7">We assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like the earth or different.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If it seems very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life has not started on Earth.</seg>
          <seg id="9">If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Michkel Paisalu.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Британский экономист Джим O'Нилл не смог дать прогноз на 2022 год, поскольку, по его мнению, подобные попытки обернутся провалом.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом он написал в статье для Project Syndicate.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Эксперт считает, что следующий год будет полон непредсказуемости и любая тенденция может изменить оборот.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Самым важным фактором остается пандемия коронавируса, а на втором месте - инфляция, полагает он.</seg>
          <seg id="6">O'Нилл также признался, что не знает, является ли повышение цен на товары временным или нет.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Как указал специалист, еще до пандемии было ясно, что "мир бесконечной щедрости центральных банков уже изжил себя" и пора вернуться к отношениям, где процентные ставки с учетом инфляции будут коррелировать с ожидаемыми темпами роста ВВП.</seg>
          <seg id="8">O'Нилл отметил, что на фоне пандемии продолжение сверхмягкой экономической политики может, по мнению некоторых экспертов, вести к новому всплеску инфляции.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Кроме того, следует обратить внимание на вопрос роста производительности, а также повышение уровня бедности и изменение климата, резюмировал O'Нилл.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Ранее глава отдела глобальных исследований "Открытие Инвестиции" Михаил Шульгин сообщил, что позитивные ожидания по курсу доллара на 2022 год сохраняются, при этом потенциал роста будет менее значительным.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В числе рисков для курса доллара Шульгин назвал денежно-кредитную политику ФРС, динамику цен на нефть и опасения на фоне пандемии коронавируса.</seg>

          <seg id="2">British economist Jim O'Neill could not give any forecasts for 2022, as, in his opinion, such attempts will prove to be a complete failure.</seg>
          <seg id="3">He wrote an article about it for Project Syndicate.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The expert believes that next year will be full of uncertainties, and any trend may change the situation.</seg>
          <seg id="5">He suggests that the coronavirus pandemic remains the key factor, and the second one is inflation.</seg>
          <seg id="6">O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase is temporary.</seg>
          <seg id="7">As the specialist noted, before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of the infinite generosity of central banks is a spent force," and now is the time to get back to the relations where interest rates considering inflation will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.</seg>
          <seg id="8">O'Neill noted that in view of the pandemic, sticking to a very soft economic policy, according to some experts, may lead to new burst of inflation.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Moreover, it is worth focusing on the issues of productivity growth, increase in the level of poverty, and climate change, O'Neill summarized.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Mikhail Shulgin, Head of Global Research Department "Otkritie Investitsii", reported that positive expectations from the USD exchange rate for 2022 still remain, however, growth potential will be less significant.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Among risks for the USD exchange rate, Shulgin listed the FTS monetary policy, oil price variations and concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Россияне отдали автодилерам около 4,5% ВВП страны</seg>
          <seg id="2">По итогам 10 месяцев 2021 года россияне потратили на покупку новых автомобилей 2 трлн 784 млрд рублей, что на 28% больше, чем за аналогичный период прошлого года, свидетельствуют статистические данные агентства Russian Automotive Market Research (НАПИ).</seg>
          <seg id="3">Для понимания масштаба - примерно такая же сумма (около 3 трлн рублей) была израсходована государством на поддержку граждан и экономики во время пандемии коронавируса.</seg>
          <seg id="4">В минувшем сентябре на заседании глав стран Шанхайской организации сотрудничества президент Владимир Путин говорил, что такая сумма сопоставима более чем с 4,5% внутреннего валового продукта (ВВП) страны за 2020 год.</seg>
          <seg id="5">По доходам на рынке России лидирует корейский бренд Kia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">За 10 месяцев этого года ему удалось реализовать автомобили на сумму 325,7 млрд рублей, что почти на 24% больше, чем годом ранее.</seg>
          <seg id="7">У родственной Kia марки Hyundai прирост еще значительнее - более 35%, а выручка от продажи машин оценивается в 279,3 млрд рублей.</seg>
          <seg id="8">На лидирующих позициях этот бренд и по увеличению средневзвешенной цены автомобиля - за год у Hyundai она выросла почти на 21%, до 1,94 млн рублей - сильнее динамика подорожания была только у Changan, Chery, Geely и Mercedes-Benz.</seg>
          <seg id="9">При этом объемы продаж у корейских брендов выросли не столь значительно: согласно статистике комитета автопроизводителей Ассоциации европейского бизнеса в России, в количественном выражении Kia реализовала за тот же период на 9,4% машин больше, чем годом ранее.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Hyundai - почти на 12%.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Замыкает тройку лидеров по объему продаж в денежном выражении японская Toyota - на автомобили этой марки россияне потратили за 10 месяцев 275,5 млрд рублей, что на 14% больше, чем годом ранее.</seg>
          <seg id="12">За японцами следует Mercedes-Benz с показателем 266,1 млрд рублей (+75%) - у немецкого премиум-бренда выросли и объем продаж (на 37%), и средневзвешенная цена автомобиля (почти на 28%, до 8,2 млн рублей).</seg>
          <seg id="13">"У Mercedes-Benz одновременно наблюдается хороший рост продаж и средневзвешенной цены - больше, например, чем у BMW - отсюда и больший рост финансовой емкости, - пояснила гендиректор НАПИ Татьяна Арабаджи. -</seg>
          <seg id="14">По темпам роста продаж фантастические показатели демонстрируют китайские бренды, также значительно увеличившие финансовую емкость в этом году".</seg>
          <seg id="15">Российская Lada по динамике роста доходов демонстрирует среднерыночные показатели (плюс 28%), на автомобили этой марки россияне потратили за 10 месяцев 229,4 млрд рублей.</seg>
          <seg id="16">На уровне прошлого года по финансовой емкости находятся компании, продажи машин которых в штуках в 2021 году упали: в частности, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi и Nissan.</seg>
          <seg id="17">УАЗ и вовсе в минусе - за 10 месяцев россияне потратили на внедорожники и пикапы этой марки 12 млрд рублей против 12,4 млрд рублей годом ранее.</seg>
          <seg id="18">На фоне проблем с поставками автокомпонентов и перебоями в производстве, охватившими весь мировой автопром, автокомпании продолжают непрерывно корректировать цены - тот же "АвтоВАЗ" повышал стоимость моделей Lada семь раз за год, последнее подорожание (на 8-10 тыс. рублей) произошло в конце ноября.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Регулярно переписывают ценники на свою продукцию и другие автопроизводители.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Объемы автомобильного рынка России в денежном выражении будут увеличиваться и дальше - помимо дефицита машин свой вклад в это делает инфляция, а также стремление автоконцернов отыграть прошлые потери, считают эксперты.</seg>
          <seg id="21">В условиях дефицита автомобилей, я думаю, что многие автоконцерны даже смогли отчасти переложить на потребителя издержки прошлых периодов, которые они не могли закладывать в цену автомобилей ранее,</seg>
          <seg id="22">говорит аналитик "ВТБ Капитала" по автопрому Владимир Беспалов. -</seg>
          <seg id="23">Полагаю, что в финансовом плане автопроизводители чувствуют себя сейчас очень хорошо, поддерживая высокую маржинальность продаж".</seg>
          <seg id="24">Косвенным индикатором этого являются темпы роста стоимости автомобилей, которые наблюдаются в течение 2021 года, цены на новые машины растут быстрее инфляции, уточняет эксперт.</seg>
          <seg id="25">В долгосрочной перспективе рынок будет расти и в количественном выражении, и в денежном, но в основном за счет инфляции и усложнения конструкции самих машин, прогнозирует Беспалов.</seg>
          <seg id="26">С ростом предложения возможности для повышения цен будут ограничены.</seg>
          <seg id="27">В денежном выражении российский авторынок продолжит рост и в будущем году, даже если рост стоимости автомобили замедлится, автопроизводители смогут получить свой доход за счет объемов, отмечает независимый консультант по автопрому Сергей Бургазлиев.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Учитывая повышенный спрос и недостаточное предложение, сейчас автопроизводители стремятся получить наибольшую прибыль с каждого проданного автомобиля, отмечает Бургазлиев. -</seg>
          <seg id="29">Увеличения объемов производства машин не ожидается минимум в ближайшие полгода, при этом в России ажиотаж подогревается еще и неуверенностью граждан в будущем.</seg>
          <seg id="30">На фоне сложившейся на рынке ситуации автомобили оказались неплохим объектом для инвестиций - купленную год назад машину, даже с пробегом, сейчас можно продать дороже изначальной стоимости, констатирует эксперт.</seg>

          <seg id="8">Байден пояснил, что если Россия вторгнется на территорию Украины, США перебросят силы в восточноевропейские страны НАТО (Болгария, Венгрия, Латвия, Литва, Польша, Румыния, Словакия, Чехия и Эстония).</seg>
          <seg id="9">"Нам придется направить больше американских и натовских войск на восточный фланг, B9 - все те страны НАТО, в отношении которых у нас есть священное обязательство защищать их от любого нападения со стороны России" - заявил Байден.</seg>

          <seg id="11">При этом он указал, что Москва видит проблему в боевом применении Киевом поставленных Турцией дронов, а также в том, что "американское вооружение приближается к нашей территории".</seg>

          <seg id="2">Средний по высоте матрас беспружинной конструкции Промтекс-Ориент Монолит Комби 16 создан из чередующихся слоев натурального латекса и кокосовой койры.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Одна сторона средне-жесткая, вторая умеренно жесткая.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Изящный белый чехол из жаккарда простеган на синтепоне и дополнен молнией по периметру.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Два вида наполнителя.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Сэндвич-модель состоит из восьми слоев наполнителей.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Между плитами латекса проложены тонкие плиты из койры кокоса.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Слоеная структура матраса отличается повышенной износостойкостью, долговечностью и устойчивостью к нагрузкам.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Натуральный латекс по своим характеристикам плотный, эластичный, воздухопроницаемый материал.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Наполнитель держит форму и быстро восстанавливается после нагрузок.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Кокосовая койра усиливает прочность изделия, от природы обладает антимикробными свойствами.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Сочетание этих двух материалов позволяет создать устойчивое к нагрузкам ортопедичное спальное место, которое прослужит покупателям долгие годы.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Универсальность и ортопедическая опора.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Матрас подходит для людей разного типа телосложения и возраста.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Средне-жесткая поверхность универсальна сбалансированным сочетанием ортопедичности и комфорта.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Обратная сторона модели менее комфортна для мягких тканей, но обладает более выраженными ортопедическими свойствами.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Умеренно жесткое спальное место более актуально для тех, кто нуждается в "разгрузке" спины и здоровой осанке.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Матрас идеально подойдет как для одного человека, так и для семейной пары.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Последние особенно оценят наличие устойчивой поверхности и отсутствие эффекта "волны", когда колебания на одной стороне матраса могут передаваться на противоположную, беспокоя человека во сне.</seg>
