          <seg id="1">I never wanna watch TV anymore cause of stuff like that...</seg>
          <seg id="2">I mean, maybe I can't tolerate entertainers anymore? Since TV is all entertainers.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix and there were tons of scenes where even though they're not saying anything that funny, the staff in the back are cracking up.</seg>
          <seg id="4">I get so uncomfortable with fake laughing like, "This is a popular entertainer so I gotta laugh at everything they say," even when there's clearly nothing funny.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But if the staff don't laugh, it will make the entertainers sulk, which probably makes it suck to work together.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Like an evil corporation from way back, that industry is so much like college athletics, so you probably have to do that to survive because apparently some entertainers' egos are too huge and they just take a bad attitude all the time.</seg>
          <seg id="7">At the same time, there's also always so much arguing like "Don't look down on entertainers," with entertainers themselves exaggerating how hard their jobs are.</seg>
          <seg id="8">I know that until they get popular they barely make any money, but what's with complaining all the time like entertainer's at the very top of the difficult jobs list?</seg>
          <seg id="9">They're just glorifying their own careers and justifying how comedians have too high of a position in the media and in society.</seg>
          <seg id="10">To be honest, my industry has some real crappy parts too, but I feel like people involved in the entertainment world are basically intolerable.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Sorry to complain so much.</seg>
          <seg id="12">It's kinda like a fart that you just have let out cause it's unhealthy to keep inside...</seg>

          <seg id="1">It's stuff like that that makes me not want to watch TV anymore...</seg>

          <seg id="3">I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were a lot of scenes where the staff was laughing in the background even when they were saying something not particularly funny.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It's not obviously a funny part, but it's creepy how the staff laughs at everything he says because he's a successful comedian.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But if the staff doesn't laugh, it puts the comedian in a bad mood, and I guess it's not good for the business relationship.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Like the old black companies, the industry is very much like an athletic club, and some comedians' egos are so big that they usually behave in an unpleasant manner, and it would be hard to make a living otherwise.</seg>
          <seg id="7">On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians themselves who are always saying, "Don't underestimate comedians," as if they are exaggerating how hard their job is.</seg>
          <seg id="8">I know that the income is pretty low until you start to sell, but I don't want to be told at every turn that being a comedian is the pinnacle of the hardest job in the world.</seg>
          <seg id="9">It sounds like a glorification of your own career and a justification for the too-high status of funny comedians in the media and in society.</seg>
          <seg id="10">To be honest, the industry I work in has its share of hardships, but it seems like the things that touch the comedian world are becoming more and more impossible.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I'm sorry if I'm complaining too much.</seg>

          <seg id="2">TLDR: Ordered a discounted wireless mouse that was cheap, the wired version of that mouse arrived, they said to send it back if I wanted a refund.</seg>
          <seg id="3">This is more an online shopping problem than homebuilt computers, but I'm gonna post here since it's unreasonable no matter what and since it's a famous place.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It started when I saw an MSI wireless gaming mouse on sale for 3,280yen (snapshot at link) in the Tsukumo Day sale that started in the Tsukumo online shop last Friday.</seg>
          <seg id="5">That's the same price as the wired version at the store, so I wondered if it might be a pricing mistake and when I checked the wired version page too, it was 5,071yen (snapshot at link) so I ordered thinking it might not be a mistake</seg>
          <seg id="6">I got the order confirmation email like normal and the shipment email the next day too</seg>
          <seg id="7">Both the messages and the purchase record on my account page had the name listed as "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless"</seg>
          <seg id="8">They didn't contact me about a mistake or a cancel notification from the order through shipment, so at this point I expected that the wireless mouse I ordered would be delivered</seg>
          <seg id="9">The problem was later, when a few hours after shipment I got an email that there was a mistake in the product registration</seg>
          <seg id="10">That email said</seg>
          <seg id="11">*The wireless version at the special sale price was actually the wired version</seg>
          <seg id="12">*The wireless mouse had already shipped so...</seg>
          <seg id="13">1. Refuse to accept it and cancel everything</seg>
          <seg id="14">2. Return the mouse only for a refund</seg>
          <seg id="15">3. Use the wired mouse as-is</seg>
          <seg id="16">So choose from those options</seg>
          <seg id="17">The wired version and wireless versions have different product pages, and the purchase record and the emails and the delivery slip all listed the wireless version, so it seems like they replaced it with the wired version arbitrarily and sent it</seg>

          <seg id="2">「建物状況調査制度」の落とし穴とは（ダイヤモンド・オンライン ） - Yahoo!ニュース</seg>
          <seg id="3">● 中古住宅市場活性化に向け 新設された「建物状況調査」制度 中古住宅取引が好調だ。</seg>
          <seg id="4">戸建て、マンションとも価格は上昇し、リフォーム市場も拡大傾向にある。</seg>
          <seg id="5">コロナ禍で持ち家志向が高まる一方、高騰する「駅前・駅近・駅直結 」 「大規模」 「タワー」といったワードに代表される物件に人気が集中、相対的に割安な新築物件が激減したことも影響しているだろう。</seg>
          <seg id="6">【この記事の画像を見る】 しかしながら海外に比べ、日本における既存（中古）住宅流通シェアはまだまだ低い水準にとどまっている。</seg>
          <seg id="7">そこで国土交通省（国交省）は2018年、宅地建物取引業法を一部改正、安心・安全な中古住宅の取引を目的とした建物状況調査、いわゆるインスペクションと呼ばれる調査をスタートさせた（https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ） 。</seg>
          <seg id="8">これは住宅に精通した建築士が、物件の劣化を含めた現状や建物のコンディションをチェックし、報告書にまとめた上で買い主に提示する制度である。</seg>
          <seg id="9">国交省はインスペクションの導入により、買い主、売り主双方にメリットがあると説明する。</seg>
          <seg id="10">売り主は売買取引前に物件調査を行うことで引き渡し後のクレームを回避でき、購入者に安心感を与えられるからだ。</seg>
          <seg id="11">ひいては競合物件の差別化にもつながるという。</seg>
          <seg id="12">一方、買い主側にとっても、購入予定の中古住宅の状態を把握でき、納得して購入できる制度であり、一見するとメリットが大きい制度だと説く。</seg>
          <seg id="13">ただ現制度のシステム上、建物状況調査の主導権を持つのは主に売り主側である。</seg>
          <seg id="14">加えて、あくまでインスペクションという制度の告知のみが義務となった点にも注意したい。</seg>
          <seg id="15">つまり、仲介を担当する不動産事業者が 、 「 物件仲介の際は建物状況調査をする建築士を紹介できます」もしくは「できません」と説明する義務はあるが、実施そのものは義務化されていないということになる。</seg>
          <seg id="16">● 売り主主導のインスペクションで 懸念されるリスク 一方、海外に目を転じると、中古市場が活況なアメリカやイギリス等では、すでに同様の制度が整備されている。</seg>
          <seg id="17">住宅売買の前段階において、買い主が「インスペクター」や「ビルディング・サーベイヤー」と呼ばれる専門家に建物調査を依頼する制度だ。</seg>
          <seg id="18">例えばアメリカの場合、州にもよるが中古住宅取引の70～90％でインスペクションが実施されている。</seg>
          <seg id="19">あくまで「買い主」が主導してインスペクションを行うという点で 、 「売り主」メインの日本型インスペクションとその性質は大きく異なる。</seg>
          <seg id="20">売り主側は、建物のコンディションを少しでもよく見せ、できる限り高く、早く売ろうとする。</seg>
          <seg id="21">対して買い主側は、調査内容を吟味し、適切な修繕を施して安心して住みたいと考えている。</seg>
          <seg id="22">同じインスペクションであっても、双方の目的・思いにはズレが生じてしまっているのだ。</seg>
          <seg id="23">そのため、日本の制度については、懸念されるリスクとして以下の点が指摘されている。</seg>
          <seg id="24">● 国が定めた売り主主導型のインスペクションの調査範囲は最小限にとどまる。</seg>
          <seg id="25">詳細な調査ではないため、本当に重要な不具合を見落とすリスクがある ●インスペクション会社にとって、担当案件を紹介してくれる仲介会社（売り主）は顧客ともいえる。</seg>
          <seg id="26">したがって、売り主に不利な調査結果を報告しないなど「忖度」したインスペクションが行われる可能性がある</seg>

          <seg id="2">What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Appraisal System?" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News</seg>
          <seg id="3">●New "Building Condition Appraisal System" established amidst revitalization of used house market 　Used home market booming.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Prices for both houses and apartments are rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.</seg>
          <seg id="5">While the COVID situation has caused an increase in preference towards homeownership, there's a rise in popularity of properties listed as "station-front, near station, directly connected to station," "large scale," and "tower". The overall number of new properties that are relatively inexpensive has plummeted, and that surely plays a role as well.</seg>
          <seg id="6">(View images in this article) However, in comparison to markets abroad, Japan's share of used-housing is still quite low.</seg>
          <seg id="7">And so in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the laws surrounding building lots and building transactions while initiating a variety of living condition inspections for the purpose of safe and secure transactions surrounding used homes. （https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ）</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is a system where an architect experienced with housing checks the current condition of the building and property, looking at things such as the level of deterioration, and compiles a report which is then presented to the buyer.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The MLIT explains that the introduction of inspections will mutually benefit buyers and sellers.</seg>
          <seg id="10">That's because by conducting proper inspections beforehand, sellers can avoid post-sale complaints while providing buyers with peace of mind.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In turn, this will help to differentiate between competitors.</seg>
          <seg id="12">It's also explained that on the other hand, the system allows the buyer to have a grasp of the condition of the house they're purchasing and allow them to make a purchase with a fuller understanding, which, at first glance, seems to be a big pro.</seg>
          <seg id="13">However, under the current system, it's primarily the seller who has control regarding these building condition surveys.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Additionally, it should be noted that only a notification of the availability of the inspection is obligatory.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In other words, the real estate agent in charge of brokering is obligated to explain whether they can refer an architect to conduct a building condition survey or not, but the implementation of the inspection itself is not obligatory.</seg>
          <seg id="16">● Risk of Seller-Driven Inspections causing concerns.    Overseas, similar systems already implemented in U.S., U.K., and other countries where the used home market is booming.</seg>
          <seg id="17">There's a system in which during the preliminary stages of a home sale or purchase, the buyer requests a survey of the building by a specialist, such as an "inspector" or "building surveyor."</seg>
          <seg id="18">In the United States, for example, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home sales, depending on the state.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The nature of the inspection process differs greatly from the "seller"-oriented Japanese style inspections because the "buyer" is responsible for conducting the inspection.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The sellers attempt to make the building look as good as possible and sell it as quickly and for as high a price as possible.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In comparison, the buyers want to examine the results of the survey and make necessary repairs to ensure a safe and comfortable living environment.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Even if the inspection in itself is the same, there is a discrepancy in the objectives and thoughts of both parties.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Due to this, the following points have been raised as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.</seg>
          <seg id="24">●The scope of the seller-initiated inspections set by the government stops at the bare minimum.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Since the survey isn't detailed, there is a risk of overlooking truly important issues ●For an inspection company, the brokerage firm (seller) that introduces the project to the company in charge can also be considered to be a customer.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Thus, there's a chance that "cover-up" inspections may take place where unfavorable information is not reported to the seller.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Aiming to revitalize the second-hand housing market The newly established ""Building Status Survey"" system The second-hand housing market has been strong.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The price of houses and condominiums is rising, and the reform market is also on an expanding trend.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In contrast to the increasing home ownership due to the coronal disaster, the popularity of properties such as ""Ekimae Station, Near Station, Direct Station"" ""Large Scale"" and ""Tower"" such as words has been concentrated, and the relatively cheap new buildings have declined sharply.</seg>
          <seg id="6">[Image from this article] However, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still low compared to overseas.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) partially revised the Housing Business Act in 2018, and started a survey on the status of buildings aimed at trading used houses in a safe and secure manner (https: /www.mlit.go.jp/common/0012199,900.pdf ).</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is a system in which architects who are well versed in housing check the condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and summarize it in a report and present it to the buyer.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Sellers can avoid claims after delivery by conducting property surveys before trading, giving buyers a sense of security.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Furthermore, it will lead to differentiation of competing properties.</seg>
          <seg id="12">On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to grasp the state of used houses they are planning to purchase, and to be able to purchase them in a convincing manner. At first glance, it is a system that has significant advantages.</seg>
          <seg id="13">However, due to the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the leading authority in the investigation of the building status.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In addition, I would like to pay attention to the fact that only the announcement of the inspection system was obligated.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In other words, a real estate agent in charge of the intermediary is obliged to explain that ""When intermediating a property, an architect can introduce a building status survey"" or ""can not"", but the implementation itself is not obligated.</seg>
          <seg id="16">On the other hand, in the United States and the United Kingdom, where second-hand markets are booming, similar systems have already been established.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In the pre-sales phase, buyers are asked to conduct a building survey by an expert called ""Inspector"" or ""Building Surveyor"".</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the U.S., inspections are conducted in 70 ⁇ 90% of used housing transactions, depending on the state.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The main aspect of ""seller"" is Japanese-style inspection and its nature is very different in that ""buyer"" leads the inspection.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The sellers try to show the condition of the building as much as possible, and sell it as soon as possible.</seg>
          <seg id="21">On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the survey, repair it appropriately, and live with peace of mind.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Even with the same inspection, the objectives and thoughts of both sides have been distorted.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as concerns about Japan's system.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The scope of survey of seller-led inspections set by the government remains minimal.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Because it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of missing a really important problem ● For an inspection company, an intermediary company (seller) that introduces the case in charge can be said to be a customer.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Therefore, there is a possibility that ""considerations"" may be conducted, such as not reporting adverse results to sellers.</seg>

          <seg id="2">What are the pitfalls of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News</seg>
          <seg id="3">Newly established "building condition survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Transactions of second-hand housing are strong.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Prices for both detached houses and condominiums have risen, and the renovation market is also expanding.</seg>
          <seg id="5">While the desire to own a house has increased due to the corona crisis, the popularity of properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station," "large-scale" and "tower," which are soaring in price, has concentrated, and the sharp decline in relatively cheap newly built properties is also likely to have had an impact.</seg>
          <seg id="6">[See the image in this article] However, the share of existing (pre-owned) housing distribution in Japan is still very low compared to overseas.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Law in 2018 and started a building condition survey, so-called inspection, for the purpose of trading safe and secure used houses (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is a system in which an architect familiar with housing checks the current state of the property, including deterioration, and the condition of the building, compiles a report, and presents it to the buyer.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This is because sellers can avoid claims after handover by conducting a property survey before the sale transaction, giving buyers a sense of security.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This, in turn, is said to lead to the differentiation of competing properties.</seg>
          <seg id="12">On the other hand, for the buyer side, it is a system that can grasp the condition of the second-hand house to be purchased, and can be purchased with conviction, and it is a system that has great merit at first glance.</seg>
          <seg id="13">However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in investigating the condition of the building.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system became mandatory.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain, "In the case of property brokerage, we can introduce an architect to investigate the condition of the building" or "we cannot," but the implementation itself is not mandatory.</seg>
          <seg id="16">On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.</seg>
          <seg id="17">This is a system in which the buyer requests a building survey from a specialist known as an "inspector" or "building surveyor" at the preliminary stage of a home purchase.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the United States, inspections are carried out in 70% to 90% of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In that the inspection is led solely by the "buyer," the nature of the inspection is very different from the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly led by the "seller."</seg>
          <seg id="20">The seller wants to show the condition of the building as much as possible, and sell it as quickly and for as much as possible.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The buyer, on the other hand, wants to live with peace of mind after examining the survey results and making appropriate repairs.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Even if it is the same inspection, there is a gap in the goals and thoughts of both sides.</seg>
          <seg id="23">For this reason, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern with regard to Japan's system.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The scope of the seller-led inspection stipulated by the government will be kept to a minimum.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Because it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects. ●For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the case in charge can be said to be a customer.</seg>
          <seg id="26">As a result, inspections may be "rigged" by not reporting adverse findings to the seller.</seg>

          <seg id="11">Ginza is a famous shopping district in Chuo-ku, Tokyo that has inspired many imitations across Japan, naming themselves "Somewhere-or-other Ginza".</seg>
          <seg id="12">The name "Ginza" originally refers to a silver coin mint, since this is where the silver mint was relocated from present-day Shizuoka in 1612 (Keicho 17).</seg>
          <seg id="13">At the time, it was known as "Shin-Ryogae-cho", but when it relocated to Kakigara-cho, it became commonly referred to as "Ginza".</seg>

          <seg id="15">Long before the Edo period, there used to be an inlet stretching from Hibiya to Marunouchi, effectively creating a peninsula known as "Edomae-jima" that stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.</seg>

          <seg id="17">When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate government in Edo, he filled in the inlet and began to develop the area around Kyobashi.</seg>

          <seg id="19">The soil and rubble from Kandayama, which was levelled, and excavated for the waterways were used to fill in the inlet.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Today, a stone monument stands out in front of the Tiffany &amp; Co. Ginza flagship store (Ginza 2-7, Chuo-ku) that marks the site of the Ginza silver mint, Ginza's origin, so why not seek it out for yourself.</seg>

Seiko Inari Shrine, in the ground floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building, is only open to the public during the Ginza Haccho Shrine Pilgrimage.</seg>
          <seg id="27">This tour of the shrines also takes in shrines that worship Acala and Ksitigarbha, but most of the shrines are dedicated to Inari.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Inari shrines have a fox statue in front of the main building, and were built in farming regions as they were believed to bring a bumper rice harvest.</seg>

          <seg id="10">Was Ginza once a peninsula?</seg>
          <seg id="11">The synonym for the downtown area that created "○○ Ginza" in various places in Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office that was located in present-day Shizuoka City moved to Edo.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At that time, it was called "New Money Exchange Town", but when it moved to Momo-cho it came to be called "Ginza".</seg>
          <seg id="14">By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" that jutted out into the sea.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Before the Edo period, the cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo-maejima" stretched from Japan Bridge to Ginza.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The tip of the peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.</seg>
          <seg id="17">When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the coves and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Ieyasu also improved the city blocks and built moats to develop boat transportation.</seg>
          <seg id="19">They then cut down the soil that had been carved out of the moat and Mt. Kanda, and reclaimed the cove.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In addition, in front of the Tiffany &amp; Co. Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of "Ginza Birthplace" that shows the site of the Ginza Office, so if you are interested, why not look for it?</seg>

          <seg id="24">At the shrine that stands at the far right of the Kabuki-za, there are not a few people who visit before and after the theater.</seg>
          <seg id="25">On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoka" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Ideyo Jizo Zōzō" is located on the Ginza terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.</seg>

          <seg id="27">This shrine tour includes places that enshrine the Fudo Akio and Jizo Bodhisattvas, but most of the shrines have Inari as a deity.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The "Inarisha" that the fox greets in front of the shrine was built in a hurry because of the benefits of "five grain fertility" where rice is often grown in places where there are many farmers.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In turn, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said that there were benefits of prosperous business, and faith spread even in Ginza, the busiest downtown area in Japan.</seg>

          <seg id="3">"This was a peninsula a long time ago.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It is unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia such as "..." as proof.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Here are some tips on Ginza that are interesting to know and will surely make you want to talk to someone.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Go over Ginza!?</seg>
          <seg id="7">First infiltration in Kinza</seg>
          <seg id="8">As you walk around Ginza, you will find eccentric place names, mysterious stone monuments, numerous shrines, and other remnants of the history of Ginza.</seg>
          <seg id="9">As I was walking in Ginza with her, I suddenly visited the silence and said, "This was a peninsula in the past.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Was Ginza once a peninsula?</seg>
          <seg id="11">"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, which is synonymous with the downtown area that created "○○○ Ginza" in various parts of Japan.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In the first place, "Ginza" is a silver coin foundry, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was currently located in Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At that time, it was called "New Ryogaecho", but when it moved to Kabukicho, it came to be known as "Ginza".</seg>
          <seg id="14">By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Before the Edo period, a cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.</seg>
          <seg id="17">When Ieyasu Tokugawa opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the cove and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In addition, Ieyasu improved the block and laid out a moat to develop shipping.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Then, the soil from the moat and Mt. Kanda were cut down to reclaim the cove.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7, Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of "Ginza Birthplace" that shows the site of the Ginza government office, so why not look for the direction you are interested in?</seg>
          <seg id="21">"Sacred place pilgrimage" in Ginza known to those in the know</seg>
          <seg id="22">In Ginza, a "sacred place pilgrimage" known to those in the know called "Ginza Haccho Shrine Tour" is held every year.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most noticeable is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of Kabuki-za.</seg>
          <seg id="24">At the shrine on the far right of Kabuki-za, many people visit before and after the theater.</seg>
          <seg id="25">On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudouson" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shuseijizoson" is on the Ginza terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.</seg>
          <seg id="26">"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not noticeable, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" was revered by Kabuki famous actor Ichimura Hazaemon. The well-known "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the 1st floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.</seg>
          <seg id="27">There are places where Fudo Myo and Jizo Bodhisattva are enshrined in this shrine tour, but most of the shrines use Inari as a deity.</seg>
          <seg id="28">"Inari Shrine", which is greeted by foxes in front of the shrine, was built extensively because it has the benefit of "five grain abundance" where rice is well fertilized in places where there are many farmers.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In turn, it has come to be said that there are benefits of prosperous business in big cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and the faith has spread even in Ginza, Japan's premier downtown area.</seg>

          <seg id="2">原因によって異なる治療法（Medical DOC ） - Yahoo!ニュース</seg>
          <seg id="3">編集部： 最近、膝の痛みが続いています。</seg>
          <seg id="4">どのような病気の可能性がありますか？</seg>
          <seg id="5">丸山先生： 膝関節の痛みが起こる原因は、ケガや関節リウマチ、痛風発作など様々です。</seg>
          <seg id="6">そのなかでも、日本人に多いのは「変形性関節症」です。</seg>
          <seg id="7">編集部： 関節が変形してしまうということですか？</seg>
          <seg id="8">丸山先生： そうです。</seg>
          <seg id="9">本来、関節の表面は軟骨で覆われていて、衝撃を和らげたり、関節の動きを滑らかにしたりする働きを担っています。</seg>
          <seg id="10">ところが、加齢や肥満、激しいスポーツなどが原因で、軟骨がすり減ったり歪んだりしてしまうことがあります。</seg>
          <seg id="11">その結果、関節の変形や炎症を招いてしまうのです。</seg>
          <seg id="12">編集部： 変形性関節症は、膝以外にも発症するのですか？</seg>
          <seg id="13">丸山先生： はい。</seg>
          <seg id="14">膝以外にも、手の指の関節や付け根、首、腰、足の親指、股関節などでも起こり得ます。</seg>
          <seg id="15">しかし、最も多いのは膝に起こるケースで、「変形性膝関節症」と呼ばれています。</seg>
          <seg id="16">編集部： そもそも、関節とはどのような構造になっているのですか？</seg>
          <seg id="17">丸山先生： 関節は2本の骨が凹凸に組み合わさっています。</seg>
          <seg id="18">そして、この2本が対面している部分は「関節軟骨」で覆われており、関節の周囲は「関節包」で包まれています。</seg>
          <seg id="19">編集部： 複雑な構造なのですね。</seg>
          <seg id="20">丸山先生： そうですね。</seg>
          <seg id="21">関節包の内層には滑膜と呼ばれる組織があり、関節液を作っています。</seg>
          <seg id="22">この関節液は、潤滑剤の役割をはたしており、ヒアルロン酸とコンドロイチン硫酸で構成されています。</seg>
          <seg id="23">「膝の動きを滑らかにするには、ヒアルロン酸やコンドロイチン硫酸がいい」と言われるのはそのためです。</seg>
          <seg id="24">編集部： 変形性関節症になると、どのような症状が起こるのですか？</seg>
          <seg id="25">丸山先生： 関節軟骨は粘りと弾性があり、骨と骨が直接ぶつからないための役割を担っています。</seg>
          <seg id="26">いわば、クッションのような役割ですね。</seg>
          <seg id="27">しかし、これがすり減ったり歪んでしまったりすると、関節を変形させたり炎症を起こしたりして、痛みを生じさせてしまうのです。</seg>

          <seg id="2">Treatments Differ Depending on the Underlying Cause (Medical DOC) -Yahoo!News</seg>
          <seg id="3">Editor: Recently, my knee has been hurting.</seg>
          <seg id="4">What condition could be causing this?</seg>
          <seg id="5">Dr Maruyama: Knee pain can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and so on.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Osteoarthritis is quite a common affliction among Japanese people.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Editor: Is that a condition where the joint becomes deformed?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Dr Maruyama: That's right.</seg>
          <seg id="9">A healthy joint is surrounded by cartilage, which absorbs impacts and helps the joint to move smoothly.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, a person's age, weight, or any strenuous activities - such as sports - that they do can cause the cartilage to wear away or become deformed.</seg>
          <seg id="11">As a result, joints can become deformed and inflammation can occur.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Editor: Can osteoarthritis manifest anywhere other than the knees?</seg>
          <seg id="13">Dr Maruyama: Yes.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In addition to the knee, osteoarthritis can affect the joints of fingers, neck, lower back, big toes and hips.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, it occurs most commonly in the knee, in which case it is called "gonarthrosis".</seg>
          <seg id="16">Editor: What is the structure of a joint anyway?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Dr Maruyama: A joint is where two bones fit together, one in the other.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The ends of bones, where they face each other, are covered with what's known as "articular cartilage", and then the whole joint is enveloped by a "joint capsule".</seg>
          <seg id="19">Editor: It sounds like quite a complicated structure.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Dr Maruyama: Yes.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The inside of the joint capsule is lined with the synovial membrane, which secretes synovial fluid.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Synovial fluid contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate, and acts as a lubricant.</seg>
          <seg id="23">This is why people say that it's good to take these as supplements for your knee joints.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Editor: What are the symptoms of gonarthrosis?</seg>
          <seg id="25">Dr Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic, and it prevents the bones from bumping into each other.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In other words, it acts as a cushion.</seg>
          <seg id="27">However, if it wears away or becomes deformed, the joint can become deformed and inflammation can occur, causing pain.</seg>

          <seg id="4">What kind of disease could it be?</seg>
          <seg id="5">Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Among these, osteoarthritis is the most common among Japanese people.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Editor: You mean that the joints become deformed?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Dr. Maruyama: Yes.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Originally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which softens impact and facilitates joint movement.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, aging, obesity, and strenuous sports can cause the cartilage to wear away or become distorted.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This results in joint deformity and inflammation.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Editor: Can osteoarthritis occur in other areas besides the knee?</seg>
          <seg id="13">Dr. Maruyama: Yes.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Besides the knees, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers of the hands, the neck, the lower back, the thumbs of the feet, and the hip joints.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, the most common case occurs in the knee and is called "osteoarthritis of the knee.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Editor: To begin with, what is the structure of a joint?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Dr. Maruyama: A joint consists of two bones that are assembled unevenly.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The area where these two bones meet is covered with "articular cartilage," and the joint is surrounded by an "articular capsule.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Editor: It is a complex structure, isn't it?</seg>
          <seg id="20">Dr. Maruyama: Yes, it is.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid.</seg>
          <seg id="22">This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.</seg>
          <seg id="23">This is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee movement.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?</seg>
          <seg id="25">Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly with each other.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It acts as a cushion, so to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="27">However, when it wears down or becomes distorted, it causes deformation and inflammation of the joints, resulting in pain.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Editor's note: I've been having knee pain lately.</seg>
          <seg id="4">What diseases are possible?</seg>
          <seg id="5">Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Among them, the most common Japan is "osteoarthritis".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Editor's note: Do you mean that the joints become deformed?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Dr. Maruyama: That's right.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, and it is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, due to aging, obesity, strenuous sports, etc., cartilage may wear out or become distorted.</seg>
          <seg id="11">As a result, it leads to joint deformity and inflammation.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Editor's note: Does osteoarthritis develop beyond the knee?</seg>
          <seg id="13">Dr. Maruyama: Yes.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and groins of the fingers of the hand, neck, hips, big toes, hips, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, the most common case is that it occurs in the knee, and it is called "knee osteoarthritis".</seg>
          <seg id="16">Editorial Department: What is the structure of joints in the first place?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Dr. Maruyama: In joints, two bones are combined in an uneven manner.</seg>
          <seg id="18">And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the periphery of the joint is wrapped in "joint capsule".</seg>
          <seg id="19">Editor: It's a complicated structure.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Dr. Maruyama: That's right.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In the lining of the joint capsule, there is a tissue called synovial membrane that makes joint fluid.</seg>
          <seg id="22">This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.</seg>
          <seg id="23">That is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements".</seg>
          <seg id="24">Editorial Department: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?</seg>
          <seg id="25">Dr. Maruyama: Articulated cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In other words, it plays a role like a cushion.</seg>

          <seg id="2">3 Types of Gambling &amp; Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News</seg>
          <seg id="3">The "Kaiji" series is a gambling themed manga series that boasts explosive popularity particularly among men.</seg>
          <seg id="4">One of the most thrilling aspects of this work is an extreme game where your life is on the line.</seg>
          <seg id="5">[Picture] Just looking makes your legs clench up... Taking on the steel beam walk!</seg>
          <seg id="6">Therefore, we'd like to test the Kaiji games that can actually be played, or look at them being played in videos.</seg>
          <seg id="7">■Numa : A pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Rebellion Kaiji".</seg>
          <seg id="8">In the manga, it surprised Kaiji with its expensive rate of 4000 yen per ball.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This "swamp" had 3 large traps: a "forest of nails," a "movable accessory," and a "three-tiered cloon," and was considered almost impossible to conquer.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, Kaiji used all sorts of tricks, and in the end, he successfully clears the swamp by placing a vinyl water tank on a building and causing the ground to sink and tilt.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji was made into a real pachinko game, and a number of people play it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Of course there is no "4000 yen per ball" gimmick, and the difficulty has been turned down, but you can experience Kaiji's feelings yourself.</seg>
          <seg id="13">■Steel Beam Crossing : A wealthy man held a "star side party" as a form of entertainment and had the debtors, including Kaiji, perform a "human horse race".</seg>
          <seg id="14">Debtors compete to see how fast they can advance atop a thin steel beam 10 meters above the ground, devising ways to avoid falling off.</seg>
          <seg id="15">There are 12 participants, and the top 2 get the prize money, but there are only four steel frames, inadequate safety measures, and a very high chance of death.</seg>
          <seg id="16">While this game is very dangerous, it was developed as a VR game and can also be experienced extremely closely to the original at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.</seg>
          <seg id="17">This Eagle Bridge has a single steel beam bridge coming out at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the seventh floor of a building), and at the end there is a "sky swing" and a "victory bridge" prepared, which you walk to.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Naturally, safety measures are in place.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Comedian "Koala Koarashi" went viral when he released a video on his YouTube channel showing him walking across the Eagle Bridge, showing that people could experience the steel beam crossing in Japan.</seg>
          <seg id="20">■E Card : a card game designed for 2 players.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The game has two sides, the emperor's side and the slave's side, and uses a total of 10 cards: one emperor's card, eight citizen's cards, and one slave's card.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The game is very well designed, with the characteristics that the emperor beats the citizens, the citizens beat the slave, and the slave beats the emperor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">In the story, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, his ear will be cut off.</seg>
          <seg id="24">After realizing that his mind was being read by an ear destroying, earphone-like device attached to his ear that detects and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, Kaiji confounded Tonegawa by cutting off his own ear to the utmost limit and sending his body readings of the chart, allowing him to win.</seg>
          <seg id="25">E Cards are commercially available and can be purchased on platforms such as Amazon.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The popular YouTuber Hikaru went viral when he uploaded a video of him playing E Cards with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played Kaiji in the movie.</seg>
          <seg id="27">■Perhaps you could try getting a taste of Kaiji's feelings?</seg>
          <seg id="28">No one wants to be in situations like Kaiji, but it is true that reading the manga makes you curious about his experiences.</seg>

          <seg id="4">One of the best things about this game is the extreme game where you risk your life.</seg>
          <seg id="5">【Photos】Just looking at it makes my legs cringe ... ... Challenge to cross the steel frame!</seg>
          <seg id="6">So this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's game that can be actually played or practiced in the planning video.</seg>
          <seg id="7">■ Numa It is a pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Busting Book Kaiji".</seg>
          <seg id="8">In the original work, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This "swamp" was set up with large traps of "Nailing Forest", "Movable Characters", and "3-Stage Kroon", and it was considered almost impossible to capture.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, Kaiji used all sorts of tricks, and in the end, he went on a rough task of placing a plastic water tank in the building to subside and tilt the ground, and he captured it brilliantly.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people are playing it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball" and the difficulty level has been reduced, but you can still taste the feeling of Kaiji.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Steel Crossing At the "Starside Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, the debtors, including Kaiji, were forced to perform the steel crossing of the "Human Horse Race".</seg>
          <seg id="14">The debtors compete for speed by devising ways to avoid falling on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.</seg>
          <seg id="15">There are 12 contestants, and the top two will win the prize, but there are only 4 steel frames, inadequate safety measures, and a good chance of death.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Although this steel frame crossing is highly dangerous, it was developed as a VR game, and you can experience it very close at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", the home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.</seg>
          <seg id="17">This eagle bridge has a single steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and after that, "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared, and you can walk to it.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Of course, safety measures are in place.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Comedian Koala Koarashi made headlines on his YouTube page when he posted a video of himself walking on the Eagle Bridge, claiming that "you can experience the crossing of steel frames in Japan."</seg>
          <seg id="20">■ E-Card A two-player card game, "E-card".</seg>
          <seg id="21">The player uses 10 cards, including 1 Emperor's Card, 8 Citizen Cards, and 1 Slave Card, and is played on the Emperor's side and the slave side.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The game is very well done, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">In the play, Kaiji faces Tonegawa under the strict rule that if you lose, you can have your ears cut off.</seg>
          <seg id="24">After a great struggle, Kaiji eventually realized that an earphone-destroying device attached to his ear was reading his mind by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and he defeated Tonegawa by cutting his ears to the limit and making his body abnormal.</seg>
          <seg id="25">E-cards are available on the market and can be purchased on Amazon.</seg>
          <seg id="26">On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of himself competing with Ryuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, on an e-card, which caused a stir.</seg>
          <seg id="27">■ Is it also possible to taste the kaiji mood?</seg>
          <seg id="28">No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read the manga, you will only get a feeling.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Why don't you feel that world view through the game?</seg>

          <seg id="2">At the prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive tablet of the zodiac sign "Tora" has appeared next year.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed the shrine visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication festival was held in front of the shrine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The shrine has been requesting votive tablets from art college students since two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="5">This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), who was in the third year, was selected from among the nine paintings of the Japanese painting course in the art department under the guidance of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The large votive tablet is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Mr. Tsuchiya said that he drew it with "an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing the back to step into the new year."</seg>
          <seg id="8">The appearance of the tiger, which stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms, included a wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, we should have some time to enjoy the beauty of nature."</seg>
          <seg id="9">Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also drawn on the votive tablets that are generally distributed.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonnegi said, "I think it will help all people to overcome difficulties."</seg>

          <seg id="2">What kind of place will Tamano be in 2030?</seg>
          <seg id="3">Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano have been engaged in a joint workshop considering what makes Tamano a great place to live in, and the changes they'd like to see made.</seg>
          <seg id="4">As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Future Planning Centre, an intermediary support organisation, young people are being given the chance to share their views, and their opinions will be relayed to the mayor.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The students were asked what they find fun.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Responses to the facilitator's question included answers such as, "When having a good time with lots of people," and "when playing the drums."</seg>
          <seg id="7">The first workshop session was held on November 13th at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Eighteen high school students got together with local residents and had discussions using the world café method: moving between "islands" that each had a set topic for discussion such as "interesting city", "livable city" and "rewarding city".</seg>
          <seg id="9">The participants wrote their thoughts down on post-it notes and organised them by sticking them on large sheets of paper.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"A city with lots of young people would be good," and "Good public transport - such as trains and buses - is essential for the livability of the city," were some of the comments.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The participants then discussed these points further to see if they had anything in common.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"I used to think that Tamono was boring, but being able to cycle along the seafront is one of the city's charms," said a third-year student (18) from Tamano Commercial and Technical High School.</seg>
          <seg id="13">A third-year student (18) from Binan High School said, "There aren't many shops and public transport is inconvenient, but it's nice being surrounded by nature," and so through dialogue with the adults, the students seemed to realise not only the issues of the area, but also its charms.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The second workshop in December was just for the high school students, during which they wrote up their proposals.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In February of next year, the students will present their proposals to the mayor, head of the board of education and other invited figures.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Higashi Rie, chairwoman of the Tamano SDGs Future Planning Centre, said of the workshops, "As well as fostering a love of one's hometown among the high school students, the workshops aim to inspire young people to be actively involved in town planning."</seg>

          <seg id="8">The ends of the shawl can be inserted into the eyes of the mesh.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This means you can wrap the shawl around you and fasten it in place without needing to tie the ends.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Get Buckっていうピーター・ジャクソンが監督したやつなんだけど</seg>
          <seg id="3">生々しいというか等身大のビートルズって感じでいろいろ新鮮だ……</seg>
          <seg id="4">解散直前だからギスギスはしてるんだけど、イメージしてたようなドラマチックなギスギスじゃなくて</seg>
          <seg id="5">頑張って仕切りながら「俺ウザいのはわかってるけどさあ！」みたいなめんどくさいポールとか、「でもさ〜」ってぐずり気味のジョージとか、わりと冷静に意見とか冗談とか言いつつも遅刻しまくりでやる気はなさげなジョンとか……なごませ役のリンゴもあんま積極的に口挟まなくて、後ろで「困ったにゃー」って顔で座ってたりとか</seg>
          <seg id="6">そういう、お互いそんな喧嘩するほど嫌いあったりはしてないけど「まあもう一緒に仕事すんのは無理やろね」っていう空気にすごくあるある感があって、ビートルズもそんな感じだったんだなっていうのが面白い 伝説の解体というかなんというか</seg>
          <seg id="7">そして、そんな空気の中でも演奏始まるとみんな本当に才能あふれまくってて</seg>
          <seg id="8">ちょっとしたフレーズからお互いが「こんなのどうよ？」ってやってるうちに「あの名曲」に仕上がっていく過程がヤバい</seg>
          <seg id="9">特に表題のGet Buckができあがる瞬間がすごい</seg>
          <seg id="10">さりげないフンフンフーンみたいな鼻歌が徐々にあのズチャ♪ズチャ♪になって歌詞が入る場面がしっかり記録されててすごい</seg>
          <seg id="11">作曲の過程をこんな風に見られることってあんまないのですごい</seg>
          <seg id="12">あとまあ当たり前だけどみんな脂乗りまくってるので演奏シーン見てるだけで幸せになれる</seg>
          <seg id="13">まだ３話中の１話らしいけど、今のところ解散の最大の原因はビートルズそのものより周りの環境だったんじゃねえかなという印象だった</seg>
          <seg id="14">四人はなんだかんだ文句言いつつも曲作り始めたら楽しそうになるんだけど、ライブの場所どうする？って話になるとプロデューサーとか宣伝マン的な人々が「やっぱビートルズは世界一ッスから！」みたいなノリでああだこうだ言い出して、もう本人たちの手を離れちゃってるんだなっていうのがわかりやすかった</seg>
          <seg id="15">まあドキュメンタリーも監督の解釈が入るので、ピーター・ジャクソンがそう感じたのが出てるのかもしれないが……</seg>
          <seg id="16">あとポールが監修してるそうなのでポールがわりと悪者っぽい場面が多いのはそのせいかもなと思った</seg>

          <seg id="1">The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is really interesting</seg>
          <seg id="2">It's called "Get Back" and it's directed by Peter Jackson</seg>
          <seg id="3">There's a lot of fresh stuff, and it feels vivid, like the true-to-life Beatles......</seg>
          <seg id="4">It's just before the breakup so there's tension, but not the kind of dramatic tension I'd imagined</seg>
          <seg id="5">It's Paul trying to take control and meddling while being all "I know how annoying I am, okay!," and George all peevish like "But come on!" and John unexpectedly calmly giving opinions and telling jokes while always showing up late and seeming unmotivated... and Ringo being a mediator, not really butting in actively but in the back making a "Yuh-oh" kinda face</seg>
          <seg id="6">Like, it's not like they hate each other enough to fight, but there's a real strong "Well, it's probably impossible to work together at this point" vibe, and it's so interesting that even the Beatles felt like that. It's like dismantling a legend or something</seg>
          <seg id="7">And even in that atmosphere, once they start to perform, the talent really comes pouring out</seg>
          <seg id="8">The progress from just a little phrase to asking one another "What about this?" to developing into such famous songs is wild</seg>
          <seg id="9">Especially the moment they develop "Get Back," from the title</seg>
          <seg id="10">It's amazing that there's a recording of the scene of how this casual humming like "mm-hmm mm-mhm" turns bit by bit into that "jugga ♪ jugga ♪" and then the lyrics come in</seg>
          <seg id="11">It's awesome cause you never get to see a song being created like this</seg>
          <seg id="12">And this is obvious, but everybody hits their stride, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy</seg>
          <seg id="13">I guess it's still only part one of three, but at this point my impression is that the biggest cause of the breakup wasn't the Beatles themselves so much as the surrounding environment</seg>
          <seg id="14">With the four of them, even while they're complaining, when they start to make music it somehow looks fun, but when the conversation turns to where to play their concert, then the producer and a publicity-type person start talking all this "Well, since The Beatles are the best in the world!" stuff, and it's easy to see how it was out of their hands at that point</seg>
          <seg id="15">I mean, documentaries are subject to the director's interpretation so it might be that it was just how Peter Jackson felt</seg>
          <seg id="16">Also it seems that Paul was supervising so I guess that's maybe why there were so many scenes where he came off as sort of the bad guy.</seg>

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a little bit of a fight.</seg>
          <seg id="6">They didn't hate each other to the point of fighting, but there was a certain atmosphere of "well, we can't work together anymore," and it's interesting to see that the Beatles were like that, too.</seg>
          <seg id="7">And even in that atmosphere, when they started to play, they were all so talented.</seg>

          <seg id="12">And of course, just watching the performance scene makes me happy because they are all so full of energy!</seg>
          <seg id="13">I know this is only the first of three episodes, but my impression so far is that the biggest cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The four of them complain about everything, but once they start writing songs, they seem to be having a good time. But when it came to the question of where to play, the producers and publicists would say, "Well, the Beatles are the best in the world! It was easy to see that the Beatles had already left their own hands.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Well, documentaries are also subject to the director's interpretation, so maybe that's how Peter Jackson felt about it. ......</seg>
          <seg id="16">Also, I heard that Paul is supervising the film, so maybe that's why he seems to be the bad guy in a lot of scenes.</seg>

          <seg id="7">And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really full of talent</seg>
          <seg id="8">From a little phrase, each other said, “How's this going?” The process of finishing it in “That Famous Song” while I'm doing it is dangerous</seg>

          <seg id="14">The four of us are complaining about something, but it seems like it will be fun once we start making songs, but what about the venue for the live? When it comes to talking about producers and publicity people, they say things like, "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!" it was easy</seg>
          <seg id="15">Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...</seg>
          <seg id="16">Also, it seems that Paul is supervising it, so I thought that might be why Paul has a lot of bad guy-like scenes.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Multiple tornadoes occurred in southern US states from the evening of Friday the 10th, through to the next day (local time).</seg>
          <seg id="3">It's thought that this was the result of locations with record temperatures for the season being hit by a sudden cold snap from the north, making atmospheric conditions unstable and causing the sudden formation of cumulonimbus clouds.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Southern states had been enjoying record temperatures thanks to warm south-westerlies.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In Houston, Texas, temperatures had risen to nearly 30°C on the 9th and 10th (local time).</seg>
          <seg id="6">During this record warm spell, cold air below -30°C blew in from the north at an altitude of 5,500m, and the large temperature difference created a severe cold front, causing the sudden formation of cumulonimbus clouds.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Multiple tornadoes struck the area.</seg>
          <seg id="8">While tornadoes are not uncommon in the southern states, the peak season for their occurrence is from the early summer onwards, and there are not many examples of major damage from tornadoes in this season.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Almost 150 tornado warnings were issued in one day, a record amount for winter.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had over 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts on Friday the 10th (local time) alone.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Tornadoes were frequently reported in the southern United States from Friday night to Saturday, September 10-11 (local time).</seg>
          <seg id="3">It is believed that strong cold air moving south of the record warm temperatures of this time of year caused extremely unstable atmospheric conditions and rapidly developed cumulonimbus clouds.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Warm air flowed into the southern U.S. from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In Houston, Texas, the high temperatures on Thursday and Friday reached nearly 30°C (86°F).</seg>
          <seg id="6">In the midst of this record-breaking warmth, strong cold air of -30°C or lower moved southward at around 5,500 m above the ground, forming an active front due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Tornadoes are believed to have occurred one after another in the vicinity.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The southern United States has always been prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The number of tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150, a record number.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and wind gusts on Friday the 10th local time alone.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This shows that there are two major areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line that includes Illinois.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third strongest of six on the EF scale (modified Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, and is believed to have had instantaneous wind gusts of around 70 m/s.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Depending on future investigations, it may be determined to be an EF 4 or 5.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Modified Fujita Scale and adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.</seg>
          <seg id="15">A JEF 3, which is equivalent to the tornado that hit the U.S. this time, has a good chance of occurring in Japan, and is at a level that could collapse a wooden house.</seg>

          <seg id="6">The best seasonal fish are selected at the market.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to Takayuki, they only lightly coat the shrimp and fish in untoasted bread crumbs so that one can appreciate the seafood's texture, and this is nowhere more evident than in the plump fried shrimp.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Their bento boxes also contain vegetables and around four deli items, and come with soup and semi-brown Hinohikari rice from Saga with mixed grains.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The vegetables are either homegrown in the adjacent vegetable plot, or purchased at farmers' markets around the prefecture.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Side dishes change with the seasons, and as Takayuki has trained in French cooking, his carrot salad and ratatouille lend colour to the dishes.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Meanwhile, "comforting, familiar flavours" (Yumi) in dishes like egg rolls seasoned with dashi stock, and other fusions of Japanese and western cuisine are enjoyed by people of all ages.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Another popular bento is the hand-formed Hamburg steak made with 100% Japanese ground pork and beef (1,000 yen).</seg>
          <seg id="13">Next year, they will also be launching a charcuterie set, featuring various meaty delicacies that make a perfect wine match.</seg>

          <seg id="2">(Kato Yuki: consultant for Hong Kong company, Find Asia Limited) Spanning over a vast area, China is important in terms of biodiversity, since it plays home to the largest number of mammal species in the world, and the third-largest number of plant species.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Some local governments recognise the value of this biodiversity and not only undertake their own conservation efforts, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Xishuangbanna, located in southwestern China, is one place.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Xishuangbanna borders Laos and Myanmar, and many ethnic groups live there, including the Dai people, who share their roots with the people of Thailand.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Mekong River, which runs through a number of countries in southeast Asia, has its source here.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Xishuangbanna accounts for only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but around 25% of China's wildlife species and 20% of its plant species call this area home.</seg>
          <seg id="8">I met up with Minguo Li in Xishuangbanna, where she plays a role in conservation, and spoke to her about her activities.</seg>
          <seg id="9">■ Minguo Li started conservation activities with her German husband, and together they have been working hard in this endeavour for the past 20 years.</seg>
          <seg id="10">What made you want to get involved in conservationism?</seg>
          <seg id="11">Minguo Li: We started our conservation venture under the moniker "TianZi " in 2000.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The inspiration came from my husband, Josef Margraf.</seg>
          <seg id="13">My husband is originally from Germany, and came to Xishuangbanna on a joint scientific project conducted by China and the UN.</seg>
          <seg id="14">It was the only tropical rainforest in China, and was a veritable hotspot for biodiversity.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, economic development in the region had fallen behind.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Consequently, to try and establish an industry here, vast swathes of the rainforest were cut down to harvest rubber, a commodity that was in short supply in China.</seg>
          <seg id="17">My husband was posted here from Germany to restore natural resources and to carry out bioprospecting.</seg>
          <seg id="18">That's when we met, when I was working as a reporter here, and then we got married.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Were you interested in nature conservation before that?</seg>
          <seg id="20">Minguo Li: Although I'm from Xishuangbanna, I'd never considered how important the rainforest is, or how extraordinary the biodiversity.</seg>

          <seg id="3">So why didn't I do log analysis with .Net Script Framework (cause if I did, I would've understood in a few minutes)? Some errors from the .dll files or related to mesh aren't in the crash logs.</seg>

          <seg id="7">- For camerawork for performing kill moves on some NPCs → Basically fixed by turning off the setting for player kill moves through the .ini: Might be competing settings for DAR and Nemesis? But then again, the upper limit for DAR animations isn't even at 10,000.</seg>
          <seg id="8">- (Basically outdoors) When moving in the field &amp; when casting some spells (for example, Frost Rune) &amp; when hitting NPCs: Turned off all settings applied to NPCs (top right in the MCM) using the SPID of Dirt &amp; Blood v. 2.0, and tried 5 times in a row and it's completely fixed.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Could the cause be a mistake in the additional armor or body mesh shader settings for some actors/NPCs? There are errors in the default .ini used by the 2.0 SPID, but in the end I got the results I wanted and the prerequisite perks for the NPCs should be applied.</seg>
          <seg id="10">At first, I had the unfounded suspicion that it was motion related to OnHit or locational damage / a combat mod (a .dll one) so I mostly checked those and these are the results that I got.</seg>

          <seg id="8">* (Basic outdoor) When moving in the field + activating some magic (e.g. Freezing Runes) and hitting NPCs: All settings for NPCs using SPID in Dirt &amp; Blood v 2.0 (upper right corner of MCM) are OFF and all improved after 5 consecutive tries.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This may be due to a shader setting error in the additional armor and body mesh worn by some actors/ NPCs. The SPID usage default.ini of 2.0 has a formatting error, but the result should be the intended result and the prerequisite perk should be applied to the NPCs.</seg>
          <seg id="10">I initially focused my checks around wetting the site attacks and OnHit related motion/combat mods (.dll's), but I got results like this.</seg>

          <seg id="2">私は双極性障害を患っているため、長いこと訪問看護を受けているのですが、今利用している訪問看護ステーションの看護師さん（女性）とは付き合いが長くなり、とても良好な関係を築けていると思っています。</seg>
          <seg id="3">毎週、色んな話をします。</seg>
          <seg id="4">もちろん服薬管理に必要なこと（一包化など）もやってくれるのですが、何よりも、精神疾患を持っている人にとっては、楽しいコミュニケーションがいかに大切か、ということを今日の訪問看護でつくづく思いました。</seg>
          <seg id="5">今日は男女の性差についての雑談というかジェンダー論なんかについても議論しちゃったり笑。</seg>
          <seg id="6">男女の性欲についてだとか、彼女がどうして離婚したのかとか、そんなこと訪問看護でしていいの？というような話もします。</seg>
          <seg id="7">たまにですが、私が女装していることもあったりします。</seg>
          <seg id="8">ただ、精神科病院がやっている訪問看護ステーションの場合は病棟で働けなくなったおばちゃん看護師が来て事務的な対応しかしてくれないとか、訪問看護で作業療法士が来ているのに「こっちは医療をやっているんだから」などと上から目線で指示したりする、という話を知人から聞いたことがあります。</seg>
          <seg id="9">私が利用しているのは社会福祉法人が経営している小さな訪問看護ステーションなのですが、精神疾患を持つ私と対等に、フランクに向き合ってくれる、ほんとうに良い看護師さんだと思います。</seg>
          <seg id="10">ちなみに美人です笑。</seg>
          <seg id="11">精神科訪問看護を受けている方もいらっしゃるでしょうし、受けることを考えている方もいらっしゃるでしょう。</seg>
          <seg id="12">訪問看護は精神疾患を持つ人にとってとてもためになります。</seg>
          <seg id="13">医師が認めてくれたらぜひ受けましょう。</seg>
          <seg id="14">そして、良い訪問看護ステーションを選びましょう。</seg>

          <seg id="2">I'm bipolar so I've been getting care visits for a while and I've known the (female) nurse at the care visit station I'm using for a long time, and I think we get along really well.</seg>
          <seg id="3">We talk about all kinds of stuff every week.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Of course she handles the medication management I need (like packaging as a single dose), but at today's care visit I really felt how important fun communication is for people with mental health problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Today we talked about how men and women are biologically different, or debated something about gender issues lol</seg>
          <seg id="6">Sometimes we talk about things that aren't appropriate for a care visit, like male and female sex drives or why she got divorced.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Also FYI I crossdress sometimes.</seg>
          <seg id="8">But I've heard from an acquaintance that at care visit stations run by mental health facilities, for example, there are visits from middle-aged nurses who can't work in a hospital ward anymore and who come and are only business-like, or even though there is a occupational therapist visiting, they talk down when giving instructions like "I'm the one in charge of medical treatment."</seg>
          <seg id="9">The place I use is a small care visit station run by a social welfare company, but I think that she's really a good nurse who treat me, someone with mental health problems, as an equal and with honesty.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Btw she's hot lol.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I bet some of you are receiving mental health care visits or are thinking about it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">They're really really helpful for people with mental problems.</seg>
          <seg id="13">If your doctor approves, definitely try it out.</seg>
          <seg id="14">And choose a good visiting care station.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In the past, I've found ones that didn't work for me and canceled the contract from my side.</seg>

          <seg id="6">We talk about the sexual desires of men and women, why my girlfriend divorced me, and other things that are not really appropriate for home nursing. I sometimes talk about such things as "Is it OK to talk about such things in home nursing?</seg>
          <seg id="7">Sometimes I even dress up as a woman.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, I have heard from an acquaintance that in the case of a home nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, an old lady nurse who is no longer able to work in the ward comes and does nothing but provide clerical support, or that an occupational therapist comes and gives instructions in a superior manner, saying "We are in charge of medical care" when a home care nurse is there. I have heard from an acquaintance of mine that the social welfare corporation I use is one of the most important ones.</seg>
          <seg id="9">I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are really good nurses who are frank with me, as an equal, as I have a mental illness.</seg>

          <seg id="4">相続税と贈与税の一体化の議論が進む中、懸念された2022年度税制改正大綱では見送られましたが、近い将来、相続税対策の王道である生前贈与が"禁じ手"になる可能性が大です。</seg>
          <seg id="5">相続のルールはどう変わるのでしょうか？</seg>
          <seg id="6">自民党前税調会長、甘利明衆院議員への直撃と共に、年内に間に合う、お得な駆け込み贈与のための贈与と相続の基本のキから節税テクニックまで余すところなく伝授します。</seg>

          <seg id="9">与党が昨年発表した2021年度税制改正大綱の一文に、資産家のみならず中間層にまで大きな動揺が広がった。</seg>
          <seg id="10">なぜなら、その言わんとすることは、相続のルールを一変させ、相続税対策の王道たる「生前贈与」を"禁じ手"にすることで相続税の大増税を図る、という意味だからだ。</seg>

          <seg id="6">In addition to a direct interview with Amari Akira, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission and a member of the House of Representatives, we will provide you with everything you need to know about the basics of gifting and inheritance, as well as some tax-saving techniques to make the most of the gift-giving season before the end of the year.</seg>

          <seg id="9">One section in the FY2021 Tax Reform Proposal released by the dominating party last year caused a great deal of consternation not only among wealthy individuals but also among the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This is because it means that the rules surrounding inheritance will be completely altered, and "gifts during one's lifetime," which are a common method to avoid inheritance tax, will be made "prohibited," resulting in a massive increase in inheritance taxes.</seg>

          <seg id="12">The greatest weapon available, the gift inter vivos, is widely used not only by the wealthy but also by corporate employees who incur inheritance tax, albeit small, due to the fact that their homes are located within the three major metropolitan areas.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Amidst said situation is where the discussion of the "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Despite being expected to be released ASAP, the proposal was not included in the 2022 Tax Reform Proposal announced on December 10, where instead the policy toward unification was reiterated with more clear details revealed in statements such as: "The current taxation system of taxation on settlement at the time of inheritance and calendar gifts will be reviewed" and "The gift tax exemption is a system that does not incur a tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted), and therefore will be reviewed."</seg>
          <seg id="15">Former Minister of State for Economic Revitalization and former Minister of State in charge of Administrative Reform Amari Akira had the following to say during our interview.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"The most important thing is to eliminate the advantage or disadvantage depending on the timing of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same regardless of when the transfer takes place."</seg>
          <seg id="17">We are currently running simulations of potential problems that may occur (due to the unification)." In the case of revisions coming together at the earliest possible time, there are only 3 more chances to utilize gift inter vivos.</seg>

          <seg id="14">Although it was not included in the 2010 Tax Reform Proposal announced on December 10, 2010, which was expected to be the fastest introduction of the new tax system, the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift tax system are to be reviewed, and the gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within a limited amount. The policy toward unification was reiterated with more detailed statements such as, "The gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount," etc.</seg>

          <seg id="13">Under such circumstances, the discussion of “integration of inheritance tax and gift tax” sprung up.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Although it was postponed in the FY22 tax system reform outline announced on December 10, when there was concern about the fastest introduction, “we will review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar year gift system” and “tax exemption measures for gift tax Since it is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (...) we will constantly review it.” A policy for integration has been set out again with more advanced wording.</seg>

          <seg id="2">この試合、ジョーンズが投げたパス＝ペイトリオッツのパスはわずか3回。</seg>
          <seg id="3">これは過去50年のNFLでは、1974年第3週にビルズが対ニューヨーク・ジェッツ戦で記録したパス2回以来の少ない回数だった。</seg>
          <seg id="4">1974年のビルズには、前シーズンに史上初めてシーズン2000ヤードを超えたO.J.シンプソンという不世出の天才RBがいた。</seg>
          <seg id="5">ビルズはシンプソンと、もう一人のRBジム・ブラクストンのランでジェッツを圧倒したのだった。</seg>
          <seg id="6">今回ペイトリオッツが、こういう極端なオフェンスを展開した最大の理由は天候だった。</seg>
          <seg id="7">バッファローはカナダとの国境に近い町で、緯度的には北海道の釧路と変わらない。</seg>
          <seg id="8">そしてこの日は、気温がほぼ摂氏1度前後、風速18mの風が吹き荒れ、試合前は吹雪いていた。</seg>
          <seg id="9">ビルズは地元だけあって、プレー選択をあまり変更しなかった。</seg>
          <seg id="10">パス30回に対しランは25回。</seg>
          <seg id="11">アレンのパスは15/30、145ヤード。</seg>
          <seg id="12">インターセプトは無かったし、決して不出来ではなかった。</seg>
          <seg id="13">10回のオフェンスシリーズでレッドゾーン侵入が4回と、得点機はあった。</seg>
          <seg id="14">特に第3Q終盤以降は3回続けてレッドゾーンまで進んだ。</seg>
          <seg id="15">ただ、その3回でFG1回の3点しか奪えなかった。</seg>
          <seg id="16">試合最終盤のゴール前ディフェンス。</seg>
          <seg id="17">4点を追うビルズは、3rd&amp;9でペナルティを犯し、3rd&amp;14となった。</seg>
          <seg id="18">ゴールまでは18ヤード。</seg>
          <seg id="19">3rd&amp;14でQBアレンは、ペイトリオッツディフェンスのラッシュに囲まれて、ポケットから出て右に流れた。</seg>
          <seg id="20">そしてエンドゾーンのTEドーソン・ノックスを狙ってパスを投げたが失敗した。</seg>
          <seg id="21">このプレーでは、右外にいたエースWRステフォン・ディグスがシャロ―アクロスを走ってエンドゾーン前でフリーになっていたが、アレンの目には入らなかったようだ。</seg>
          <seg id="22">4th&amp;18、アレンはエンドゾーンに左外から走り込んだWRガブリエル・デービスを狙ったが、パスは手前でペイトリオッツのDBマイルス・ブライアントに叩かれて失敗に終わった。</seg>
          <seg id="23">ブライアントはビルズのWRコール・ビーズリーをマンツーマンカバーしていたが、途中でアレンの動きを見てビーズリーを放し、パスへ反応していた。</seg>
          <seg id="24">2人のレシーバーを見落としたアレンは、2回ともエンドゾーンを狙ってパスを投げた。</seg>
          <seg id="25">4thダウンのパスは決め打ちだったのかもしれないが、3rdダウンは、TDを狙う必要は無かった。</seg>
          <seg id="26">2回のプレーでファーストダウンを奪えばよい。</seg>
          <seg id="27">まだ2ミニッツの前だったので、4th&amp;ショートにしてしまえば、自身のランもあるアレンの能力が生きたはずだった。</seg>

          <seg id="1">[NFL] How it Feels to Win a Game After Only 3 Passes (BBM Sports) - Yahoo!News</seg>
          <seg id="2">In the Patriots' latest game, only three passes, thrown by Jones, were made.</seg>
          <seg id="3">This is the lowest number of passes in the last 50 years of the NFL, ever since Bills made only two passes in a game against the New York Jets in the 3rd week of the 1974 season.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The 1974 Bills lineup had an extraordinarily talented running back by the name of O.J. Simpson, who became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in the previous season.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The Bills defeated their opponents with Simpson's run and that of another running back named Jim Braxton.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In this game, the weather played a big role in the Patriots being able to run such a strong offensive.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Buffalo is located close to the border with Canada and is at the same latitude as Kushiro, Hokkaido.</seg>
          <seg id="8">On the day of the game, the temperature was around 1°C with strong winds, and it had been snowing since before kickoff.</seg>
          <seg id="9">As the local team, the Bills decided not to change their lineup much.</seg>
          <seg id="10">They made 30 passes and 25 runs.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Allen made 15 of the 30 passes and ran 145 yards.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There were no intercepts, so it was pretty good play, all in all.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In their 10 offensive runs, they achieved 4 red zone incursions, and had the chance to score.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Three of the times they reached the red zone were in the end of the 3rd quarter.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, of those three times, they were only able to score 1 field goal.</seg>
          <seg id="16">They switched to defending the goal in the last moments of the game.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The Bills, trailing 4 points, were given a penalty on the 3rd and 9, which became the 3rd and 14.</seg>
          <seg id="18">It was only 18 yards to the goal.</seg>
          <seg id="19">At the 3rd and 14, quarterback Allen was rushed by the Patriots' defense, but managed to escape the pocket and run off to the right of the field.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He attempted to pass the ball to tight end Dawson Knox, who was in the end zone, but was not successful.</seg>
          <seg id="21">During this play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran a shallow cross and became unmarked in front of the end zone, but it seemed like Allen did not notice him.</seg>
          <seg id="22">At the 4th and 18, Allen tried to pass to wide receiver Gabriel Davis who was running down the outside left of the end zone, but it was intercepted by Patriots' defensive back Myles Bryant.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Bryant had been covering the Bills' wide receiver Cole Beasley one-on-one but, on spotting Allen's movement, he released Beasley and reacted to the pass.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Allen passed into the end zone twice, each time not noticing his two receivers.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The pass in the 4th down was on target, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown with the pass from the 3rd down.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It would have been good if they had secured their first touchdown in their 2nd play.</seg>
          <seg id="27">There were still two minutes on the clock, so if it had been a 4th and short, Allen could have been in with the chance of running it in himself.</seg>

          <seg id="3">This was the fewest number of passes in the NFL in the past 50 years, since the Bills recorded two in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The 1974 Bills had an unheralded genius RB in O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season the previous season for the first time ever.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The Bills dominated the Jets on the run with Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The main reason the Patriots ran such an extreme offense this time was the weather.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, not unlike Kushiro in Hokkaido, Japan, in terms of latitude.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And on this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius and the wind was blowing 18 mph, and it was snowing before the game.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Bills did not change their play selection much, as they were only local.</seg>
          <seg id="10">They had 25 runs compared to 30 passes.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Allen was 15/30 passing for 145 yards.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There were no interceptions, and it was by no means a poor performance.</seg>
          <seg id="13">There were scoring opportunities, with four red zone penetrations in 10 offensive series.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, they made it to the red zone 3 times in a row.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, they were only able to score 3 points on 1 FG in those 3 attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The Bills, trailing by 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd&amp;9, and it was 3rd&amp;14.</seg>
          <seg id="18">They were 18 yards from the goal.</seg>
          <seg id="19">On 3rd&amp;14, QB Allen was surrounded by a rush by the Patriots defense and drifted right out of the pocket.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He then threw a pass aimed at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but missed.</seg>
          <seg id="21">On the play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was outside to the right, ran sharrow-across to free himself in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.</seg>
          <seg id="22">On 4th&amp;18, Allen tried to get WR Gabriel Davis running from outside left into the end zone, but the pass was beaten in front of him by Patriots DB Myles Bryant and failed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Bryant was man-to-man coverage on Bills WR Cole Beasley, but saw Allen's move on the way out, released Beasley, and reacted to the pass.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Allen, who missed the two receivers, threw a pass both times, both times aimed at the end zone.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The 4th down pass may have been decisive, but on 3rd down, there was no need to go for the TD.</seg>
          <seg id="26">You only need two plays to get a first down.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Since it was still before 2 minutes, a 4th and short would have made use of Allen's ability to have his own run.</seg>

          <seg id="12">There was no interception, and it was by no means impossible.</seg>
          <seg id="13">There was a scoring machine, with 4 red zone invasions in the 10th offensive series.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, it progressed to the red zone three times in a row.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, I was only able to get 3 points in 1 FG in those 3 times.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Defense in front of goal in the final game of the game.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty in 3rd &amp; 9, and became 3rd &amp; 14.</seg>
          <seg id="18">It's 18 yards to the goal.</seg>
          <seg id="19">On 3rd &amp; 14, QB Allen flowed to the right out of the pocket, surrounded by the rush of the Patriots defense.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Then he threw a pass aiming for TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but he failed.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran Sharo-Across and went free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen didn't get into Allen's eyes.</seg>
          <seg id="22">On the 4th &amp; 18, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the outside left, but the pass was hit by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in the foreground and ended in failure.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Bryant was covering WR Cole Beasley of the Bills one-on-one, but he saw Allen's movements on the way and released Beasley and responded to the pass.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw passes aiming for the end zone on both occasions.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The 4th down pass may have been a decisive hit, but there was no need to aim for TD for the 3rd down.</seg>
          <seg id="26">You just need to take the first down in two plays.</seg>
          <seg id="27">It was still 2 minutes ago, so if I set it to 4th &amp; short, Allen's ability, who also has his own run, should have lived.</seg>

          <seg id="2">In that game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.</seg>
          <seg id="3">That was the fewest passes in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills recorded two in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In 1974, the Bills had a prodigy running back named O.J. Simpson, who surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time around was the weather.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at 18m, and there was a blizzard before the game.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Bills, being local, didn't make many changes to their play selection.</seg>
          <seg id="10">He passed 30 times and ran 25 times.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Allen's passing was 15 / 30 for 145 yards.</seg>
          <seg id="12">He didn't have an interception, and he wasn't bad.</seg>
          <seg id="13">There were scoring opportunities, with four red zone incursions in the 10 offensive series.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, in those three innings, they were only able to score three points on one FG.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The defense in front of the goal in the final minute of the game.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Chasing four points, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd-and-9 to make it 3rd-and-14.</seg>
          <seg id="18">It is 18 yards to the goal.</seg>
          <seg id="19">On 3rd-and-14, QB Allen came out of the pocket and drifted to the right, surrounded by a rush from the Patriots defense.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He then attempted to throw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.</seg>
          <seg id="21">On that play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was outside right, was free in front of the end zone after running a shallow across, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.</seg>
          <seg id="22">On 4th-and-18, Allen attempted a pass to WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from outside the left, but the pass fell short when it was tapped by Patriots DB Miles Bryant.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley when he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to respond to the pass.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Allen missed two receivers and threw passes in the end zone on both occasions.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The pass on the 4th down may have been decisive, but on the 3rd down, there was no need to aim for a TD.</seg>
          <seg id="26">All you have to do is get a first down on two plays.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Since it was still 2 minutes before, Allen's ability to have his own run should have been alive if he had made it to 4th and short.</seg>

          <seg id="3">This was a small number of times since Bills recorded two passes against New York Jets in the third week of 1974, on the NFL in the last 50 years.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In 1974, Bills had O.J. Simpson, the world's first RB over 2000 yards in history.</seg>

          <seg id="6">The weather was the biggest reason that Patriots developed such an extreme offensive this time.</seg>

          <seg id="9">Bills was only local and didn't change a lot of play choices.</seg>
          <seg id="10">There were 25 runs compared to 30 passes.</seg>

          <seg id="14">Especially after the end of the third quarter, I went to the red zone for three consecutive times.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, only three FGs were allowed in the three rounds.</seg>

          <seg id="17">Bills, who followed the four points, made a penalty in 3rd &amp; 9th and reached 3rd &amp; 14th.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The goal was 18 yards.</seg>
          <seg id="19">At 3rd &amp; 14th, QB Allen flowed right out of the pocket, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defenses.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He threw a pass for TE Doson Knox in the end zone, but failed.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In this play, Ace WR Stepon Diggs, who was outside the right, ran through Sharo-Across and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen didn't get into the eye.</seg>
          <seg id="22">4th &amp; 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran out of the left in the end zone, but the pass was hit by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant and failed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Bryant had one-to-one covered Bills' WR Call Beathley, but on the way he saw Allen's movement and released the Beathley and reacted to the path.</seg>
          <seg id="24">After losing the two receivers, Allen threw a pass to the end zone twice.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The 4th down path might have been decided, but the 3rd down didn't have to aim for a TD.</seg>
          <seg id="26">You can take the first down by playing two times.</seg>

          <seg id="1">[NFL] Which team won the game with three passes? How did the players feel? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News</seg>
          <seg id="2">In this game, Jones only threw three passes for the Patriots.</seg>
          <seg id="3">It was the fewest in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills had two against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The 1974 Bills had a once-in-a-generation RB phenom in O.J. Simpson, who had passed for more than 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the running of Simpson and another running back, Jim Braxton.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The biggest reason why the Patriots played such an extreme offense this time was the weather.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and its latitude is the same as that of Kushiro in Hokkaido.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius and the wind speed was 18m, and there was a snowstorm before the game.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Bills didn't change much in their play selection because they're local.</seg>
          <seg id="10">As opposed to 30 passes, there were 25 runs.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Allen is 15-30 with 145 yards passing.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There were no interceptions and no fumbles.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In the 10 offensive series, the Red Zone was invaded 4 times, and there were opportunities to score.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In particular, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row after the end of the third quarter.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, they were only able to take three points from one FG in those three times.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The defense in front of the goal in the final minute of the game.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Trailing by four, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd-and-9 to make it 3rd-and-14.</seg>
          <seg id="18">18 yards to goal.</seg>
          <seg id="19">On 3rd-and-14, QB Allen dribbled out of the pocket to the right, surrounded by a rushing Patriots defense.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He then attempted a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but it fell incomplete.</seg>
          <seg id="21">On that play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who was outside right, ran a shallow cross and broke free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register with Allen.</seg>
          <seg id="22">On fourth-and-18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the left side of the field, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Myles Bryant.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Bryant was covering Bills wide receiver Cole Beasley one-on-one, but he saw Allen's move in the middle, released Beasley and reacted to the pass.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Allen threw both times for touchdowns, both times finding the end zone after eluding two receivers.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The pass on 4th down may have been the clincher, but there was no need to try for a TD on 3rd down.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They only have to get a first down on two plays.</seg>
          <seg id="27">It was still two minutes to go, so if they had made it 4th &amp; short, Allen's ability to make his own runs would have come to life.</seg>

          <seg id="2">スポンジ</seg>
          <seg id="3">どんなに頻繁に替えても、おそらく推奨されているほど頻繁には取り換えていないのがスポンジだろう。</seg>
          <seg id="4">2017年の研究から、キッチンスポンジはたとえ毎日電子レンジで殺菌したとしても、細菌がたくさん繁殖することがわかっている（それでもレンジで殺菌するのはオススメ ） 。</seg>
          <seg id="5">この研究をしたドイツの研究者は、清潔に保つには1週間に1度スポンジを交換するよう勧めている。</seg>
          <seg id="6">まな板</seg>
          <seg id="7">アメリカ合衆国農務省は、擦り切れ始め、傷や溝ができたら、まな板を取り換えるべきだと指摘している。</seg>
          <seg id="8">一度、傷や溝が進行すると清潔に保つのが難しくなり、細菌が繁殖するからだ。</seg>
          <seg id="9">まだ大丈夫な場合、1ガロン（約3.8リットル）の水に無香料の液体漂白剤をテーブルスプーン1杯溶かした溶液で頻繁に消毒するのを忘れずに。</seg>
          <seg id="10">液体にまな板の表面を浸して、数分置く。</seg>
          <seg id="11">きれいな水ですすいで、自然乾燥させるか清潔なペーパータオルで軽くたたくように水を切って乾かす。</seg>
          <seg id="12">欠けたり割れたりした食器</seg>
          <seg id="13">お気に入りのマグカップを処分するのは胸が痛むかもしれないけれど、欠けた表面は細菌やバイ菌の新たな温床になる。</seg>
          <seg id="14">それに、欠けた部分で唇を切ったり、飲み物がこぼれたりする原因にもなる。</seg>

          <seg id="2">Sponge</seg>
          <seg id="3">Even if you replace your sponge frequently, you probably don't do it as often as is recommended.</seg>
          <seg id="4">A 2017 study found that bacteria can still remain and continue to multiply even if the sponge is sterilised in the microwave on a daily basis (although this is still a good practice).</seg>
          <seg id="5">The German team that conducted the study recommend changing your sponge once a week for the sake of cleanliness.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Chopping board</seg>
          <seg id="7">The US Department of Agriculture recommends that a chopping board needs replacing when the surface starts to wear down or gets scratches or grooves in it.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Once a scratch or groove forms, it only gets more difficult to clean over time, and can harbour some nasty bacteria.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Even if it is still okay, remember to frequently disinfect your chopping board in a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach added to 1 gallon of water (around 3.8l).</seg>
          <seg id="10">Submerge the chopping board in this solution, and allow it to soak for a few minutes.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Rinse with clean water, and allow it to dry naturally, or pat it down with a clean paper towel.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Chipped or cracked dishes</seg>
          <seg id="13">Although it may break your heart to part with your favourite mug, a chipped surface can be a breeding ground for bacteria.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Not to mention the fact that the chipped part may cut your lips or cause spillages.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Maybe it's time to start searching for a new favourite mug!</seg>

          <seg id="1">Observation "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" Training is the True Battle.</seg>
          <seg id="2">"Equal Value Exchange Effort" is the hymn of humanity &lt;Commemorating the start of 'Yuukaku-hen' &gt; (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News</seg>
          <seg id="3">Among recent shōnen manga, "Kimetsu no Yaiba" is particularly unique in that there is "an inordinate amount of training."</seg>
          <seg id="4">It's a common idea that training segments, in which there are no battles and characters train day in and day out, are less than popular among readers.</seg>
          <seg id="5">This can be inferred from the fact that in the same Jump manga "One Piece," when the Straw Hat gang was separated, they went through two years of training, but it was only slightly touched upon with only a few minor details drawn.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Although, it could also be said that one of the charms of One Piece is seeing all of the eccentric lands throughout the world, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible with that.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Now, it can be said that the training of Tanjiro, the protagonist of "Kimetsu no Yaiba", began when he was told by Tomioka Giyu, "Don't allow others to hold the right over life and death!" after Giyu saved Tanjiro, and also spared Nezuko after she had tried to take Tanjiro's life.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The weak have no rights and no choice, they are forced to bend by the strong at every turn.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Even while saying so, he was kind enough to introduce Tanjiro to Sakonji Urokodaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps (he also happens to be a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).</seg>
          <seg id="10">Upon Tanjiro's first meeting with Urokodaki, he was asked what he would do "were his sister to eat someone", and Tanjiro received a hard slap after struggling to answer, being told that his "judgment was too slow."</seg>
          <seg id="11">It's an exchange that at first sight seems irrational, and is often talked about among fans.</seg>
          <seg id="12">However, traveling with a sister who has become a demon is fraught with the possibility that there may come a moment when such a decision has to be made.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It can be said that this is an initiation into training beginning with the mindset.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Nonetheless, Urokodaki takes Tanjiro, a complete novice with zero training, to Mount Sagiri and tells him to make it down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The air on the mountain is so thin, and the mountain itself is so full of traps like pitfalls and stone throwers, that there's a possibility of death before even beginning training.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Even so he uses his extremely sharp sense of smell to detect the smell of the traps placed by human hands and somehow manages to avoid them with a bit of "plot armor."</seg>
          <seg id="17">Still, within the story, Tanjiro showing "That doesn't mean I'm suddenly so physically gifted that I can get around it all, though!!" is the essence of what makes Kimetsu, Kimetsu.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Ordinary people don't suddenly get stronger out of the blue, and any 'awakening' they experience is just the ability to use "the power and skills they have honed up to that point" at their true potential.</seg>
          <seg id="19">"Equal Value Exchange Effort", where those who put in effort are rewarded as much as they put in, and get nothing when an effort isn't made, is an anthem for human beings, who are different from the demons which possess unfounded supernatural powers, and is an unmovable rule that is consistent in this work.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The "Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a hymn to humanity &lt;Memorizing the start of the "Yuukaku-hen" anime&gt; (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo!</seg>
          <seg id="3">What makes "Blade of the Oni no Shonen" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the "excessive amount of training.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It is a common belief that training sessions, which usually do not involve battles, are not popular among readers.</seg>
          <seg id="5">This can be inferred from the fact that in "One Piece," another Jump manga, when the Straw Hat gang was separated from the rest of the gang, there was a two-year training period, but the rest of the story was skipped over in a hurry.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Well, one of the charms of Onimune is the eccentricity of the lands he travels through, and "training in the same place" may not be a good match for him.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In "Blade of Demon's Destruction," Sumijiro, the protagonist of the story, gets down on his knees to Tomioka Yoshiyuu, who saved his life, and begs for the life of Priestess Nezuko, who tried to take his life, and is told, "Don't let others take your life! ! When he got down on his knees and begged for Priestess' life, who tried to take his life, he was told by Yoshiyuu, "Don't let anyone else take your life!</seg>
          <seg id="8">The weak have no rights and no choices, but are always twisted by the strong... ... ... .......</seg>
          <seg id="9">Having said that, Giyu kindly introduced Sakonji Rinkutaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Onikagitai (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).</seg>
          <seg id="10">When Sumijiro's first contact with Rinkutaki was when he was asked what he would do if his sister ate a man, Sumijiro was at a loss for an answer and hit him with a hand, telling him that he was too slow in making a decision.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This is a seemingly unreasonable exchange that is well known among fans.</seg>
          <seg id="12">However, the possibility exists that he may be forced to make such a decision at some point in his life if he carries around his sister who has turned into a demon.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It is an initiation into training in order to be prepared for such a moment.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, Rinkutaki takes Sumijiro, a novice who has yet to train, to Mount Sagiri and tells him to get down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The mountain is full of traps such as pitfalls and stone throwers in addition to the thin air, and Sumijiro is likely to die before he can begin his training.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Even so, he uses his keen sense of smell to sniff out the faint scent of traps set by human hands and somehow manages to avoid them, which is barely a "hero's compensation".</seg>
          <seg id="17">Still, "That doesn't mean that my physical ability suddenly becomes so high that I can avoid all of them, though! ! But that is the essence of what makes Onimasu Onimasu.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Ordinary people do not suddenly become strong without any proof, and when they awaken, it is only to be able to use "the power and techniques they have honed up to that point" at their true potential.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The "equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who make effort in proportion to their effort and rewards nothing for effort that has not been made, is an anthem for human beings, different from demons that have supernatural powers without any evidence, and is a rule that is consistent throughout this work.</seg>

          <seg id="2">“Equivalent Exchange of Effort” is a human hymn ＜Commemorating the start of the anime “Yukaku Edition” ＞ (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! news</seg>
          <seg id="3">What makes “Demon Slayer” particularly heterogeneous among recent shonen comics is that “there is a lot of training.”</seg>
          <seg id="4">It has become an established theory that in most cases there are no battles, and training editions that train at dawn or dusk are not popular with readers.</seg>
          <seg id="5">That's because even in the same jump comic “ONE PIECE,” there was a two-year training when the Straw Hat Pirates became separated, but I drew only the touch and skipped the rest briskly You should know it by guessing it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Well, one of the attractions of dresses is the eccentricity of the land they cross, and there are times when “staying in the same place and training” is not so compatible.</seg>
          <seg id="7">By the way, the training of Tanjiro, the main character of “Demon Slayer,” was prostrate to Yoshiatsu Tomioka, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, and said, “Don't let others seize the right to take life and death! ! It can be said that it started when I was told by a volunteer.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The weak have no rights or options, they can only be screwed down by the strong with all their power...</seg>
          <seg id="9">While saying that, it was the kindness of volunteer courage that introduced Sakonji Rinotaki, a “nurturer” who trains those who wish to enlist in the Demon Slayer Squad (he is also a bad community that does not explain its intentions).</seg>
          <seg id="10">In the first contact between Tanjiro and Rinotaki, he was asked, “What do you do when your sister eats people,” and Tanjiro, who was stuck in an answer, said “judgment is slow.”</seg>
          <seg id="11">At first glance, it's an unreasonable exchange of storytellers even among fans.</seg>
          <seg id="12">However, taking my sister who has become an ogre with me is conceived of the possibility that the moment when I will be forced to make such a decision may come.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It can be said that it is an initiative to enter training from a mental attitude.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, Rinotaki takes Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri, and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The air in the mountains is thin and full of pitfalls, trebuchets, and traps, and they seem to die before they start training.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Even so, it is barely a “protagonist correction” to sniff out the faint smell of traps set by human hands with a sharp sense of smell possessed and somehow avoid it.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Still, “that's why my physical ability doesn't suddenly increase enough to be able to avoid all of that all of a sudden! ! Making Tanjiro say, is probably the essence of what makes Demon Slayer Demon Slayer a demon slayer.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Ordinary people don't suddenly become stronger without any support, and the only thing that awakens is that they can use “the power and skills they have polished up until then” with their original potential.</seg>
          <seg id="19">“Equivalent Exchange of Effort,” which rewards those who have made efforts only a lot, and does not reward anything for efforts that have not been made, is a human anthem that is different from demons who can have unfounded paranormal powers, and it is a rule that is difficult to move that is consistent with this work .</seg>

          <seg id="4">It is an established theory that the training edition, which generally has no battles and trains day in and day out, is not popular with readers.</seg>
          <seg id="5">This can be inferred from the fact that in the same jump manga, "One Piece," when the Straw Hat Crew were separated, they had two years of training, but they only drew the touch and skipped the rest with gusto.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Well, one of the charms of the one piece is the eccentricity of the place where it travels, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Well, it can be said that the training of Tanjiro, the main character of "Kimetsu no Yaiba," began when Tomioka Yoshitake, who saved his life, got down on his knees and begged for the life of Tsuzuko, who was about to take his own life, and was told by Yoshitake, "Don't let anyone else have the right to kill or take your life!"</seg>
          <seg id="8">The weak have no rights or options, they can only be defeated by the strong through force....</seg>
          <seg id="9">With that in mind, it was the kindness of Yoshitake that introduced Rintaki Sakonji, a "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the demon squad (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).</seg>
          <seg id="10">Tanjiro's first contact with Rintaki was when he was asked, "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" when Tanjiro was stuck for an answer, he said, "Your judgment is slow," and fired a shot.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that's talked about even among fans.</seg>
          <seg id="12">However, walking with her sister, who has become a demon, carries the possibility that there may come a moment when she will be forced to make such a decision.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It can be said that it is an initiation into training from the state of mind.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, he takes Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri, and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The air on the mountain is thin and full of traps, catapults, and traps, and I feel like I'm going to die before I even start my training.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Still, with his keen sense of smell, he is able to sniff out the faint scent of traps that have been planted by human hands, and somehow avoid them, which is barely a "hero correction."</seg>
          <seg id="17">Still, it's the essence that makes Kimetsu Kimetsu that makes Tanjiro say, "That doesn't mean that my physical ability will suddenly become so high that I can avoid it all of a sudden!!"</seg>
          <seg id="18">Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any backing, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills they have honed up to that point" to their true potential.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Among recent boy cartoons, ""The Blade of Demonishment"" is particularly different from ""There are a lot of training"".</seg>
          <seg id="4">There is almost no battle, and it is a theory that the reader's popularity is not favorable for training in the morning or evening.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In the same jump manga ""ONE PIECE"", I had two years of training when the straw had to be separated, but I guess it was because I painted only the touch and the rest was flying vigorously.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Well, Wampi is one of the charms of the exotic nature of the migratory land, ""Stay in the same place and train"" sometimes does not go well.</seg>
          <seg id="7">By the way, the main character of ""The Blade of Onigiri"" Tanjiro's training started when Yoshitomo Tomioka, who helped his life, asked Nezuko to take his life and told Yoshitomo, ""Don't let others take the right to kill!""</seg>

          <seg id="11">It's an inexhaustible exchange of narration among fans at first glance.</seg>
          <seg id="12">However, it is possible that taking her sister, who has become a demon, may be a moment when she is forced to make such a decision.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It can be said that it is an initiation to practice from a mental posture.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, it is said that the Doujin charcoal Jiro, who has not trained yet, will be taken to Sagiriyama and will descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The mountain is full of traps, pitfalls and trebuchets on the thin air, so let's die before we start training.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Nevertheless, it is barely the ""main character correction"" to sniff out the faint smell of the crocodile that was served by people with a sharp sense of smell in his possession and somehow avoid it.</seg>
          <seg id="17">So suddenly I can avoid it all, I don't suddenly get higher in my physical ability! !!</seg>

          <seg id="3">What makes "Demon Slayer" particularly different from other recent shonen manga is that "there's a lot of training."</seg>
          <seg id="4">It is generally accepted that training chapters that do not have battles and require training at dawn and dusk are not popular with readers.</seg>
          <seg id="5">This can be inferred from the fact that when the Straw Hat Crew was separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE," although he had trained for two years, he only drew the touch and quickly skipped the rest.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Well, one of the charms of Wampi is the eccentricity of the places you wander through, although "staying in the same place and training" may not be such a good fit.</seg>
          <seg id="7">By the way, it can be said that the training of the main character, Sumijiro, in "Devil's Blade" began when he begged for the life of Shizuko, who was about to take her own life, and was told by Tachioka Yoshitake, who saved his life, "Don't let others take the power of life and death!!."</seg>
          <seg id="8">The weak have no rights and no choice, they can only be crushed by the strong with all their might...</seg>
          <seg id="9">At the same time, he introduced Rintaki Sakonji, an "educator" who trains those who wish to join the Ghostbusters, and the gentleness of Yoshitake (also a bad comedian who doesn't explain his intentions).</seg>
          <seg id="10">Sumijiro's first contact with Rintaki was when he was asked, "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" and he replied, "I'm slow at making decisions," to Sumijiro who was stuck for an answer.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Even among fans, there is a lot of chatter, which at first glance seems unreasonable.</seg>
          <seg id="12">However, walking around with a sister who has become an ogre is pregnant with the possibility that there may come a moment when such a decision must be made.</seg>
          <seg id="13">It can be said to be an initiation into the training from the mindset.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, Rintaki takes Sojiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The air is thin and the mountain is full of pitfalls, trebuchets and traps, and I'm sure I'll die before I can start my training.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Even so, he uses his keen sense of smell to sniff out the faint scent of a trap set by a human hand, and barely manages to avoid it, making him the "main character correction."</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even so, it is the essence of demon-slaying to make Sojiro say, "I'm not going to suddenly become physically strong enough to avoid all of that!!"</seg>
          <seg id="18">Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any reason, and when they wake up, they can only use the "powers and techniques they've honed up until then" to their full potential.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The "equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who make an effort, but does not reward those who do not, is a human hymn that is different from demons that can have supernatural powers without basis, and it is a hard-to-change rule that is consistent with this work.</seg>

          <seg id="7">It can be said that the training of Sumjiro, the main character of "Demon Slayer", began when he sat down to Tomioka Volunteer, who saved his life, and begged Negeko for his life, who tried to take his life, and he was told by Volunteer, "Do not let others hold the right to live, kill, and take away!"</seg>
          <seg id="8">The weak have no rights or options, they are all screwed down by the strong by force....</seg>
          <seg id="9">While saying that, it was the kindness of volunteers (and the poor community who do not explain their intentions) that introduced Sakonji Rintaki, a "educator" who trains those who wish to join the demon killing team.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The first contact between Sumijiro and Rintaki is asked, "What will you do when your sister eats a person?"</seg>
          <seg id="11">At first glance, it is an unreasonable exchange of stories among fans.</seg>

          <seg id="4">Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, 54, who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of injuring a 71-year-old man in the first rear-end collision, and sent him to the police on the morning of the 12th.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Nomura's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura was temporarily unconscious immediately after the accident.</seg>

          <seg id="2">３巻から始まった第２０回超人オリンピックがこの４巻で完結！</seg>
          <seg id="3">開幕から準決勝戦までを一気に描き切った前巻とは対照的に一戦のみに焦点を絞ったがゆえの新たな仕掛けが満載です！</seg>
          <seg id="4">●『キン肉マン』4巻 レビュー投稿者名 おぎぬまＸ★★★★★（星５つ中の５） ●超人プロレスは試合の前からもう始まっている！</seg>
          <seg id="5">この４巻はひと言で言うとキン肉マン対ロビンマスクの決勝戦をじっくり丁寧に描いた一冊なわけですが、まず押さえておきたいのは、だからといって決してリング上の試合だけを描いた巻なのではないということです。</seg>
          <seg id="6">調印式から始まって、お互いの牽けん制せい合戦や特訓風景など、それまでと打って変わってなかなか試合にいかないんですけど、それが決して退屈でもない。</seg>
          <seg id="7">世紀の一戦がいよいよ始まるという緊張感が徐々に高まっていく作中のこの感じは、読者のテンションの高まりにも確実につながっていて、この期間すら実に計算された演出だと感嘆しきりです。</seg>
          <seg id="8">そして、大事な決勝前にもうひと山、見逃せないのがテリーマン対ラーメンマンの３位決定戦です。</seg>
          <seg id="9">対戦カードとしての豪華さもさることながら、僕が好きなのは試合前に舞台裏でラーメンマンがキン肉マンのポスターに向けて「これからはわたしがねらう番よ ！ ！ 」</seg>
          <seg id="10">とチョップを叩きつけようとする。</seg>
          <seg id="11">しかし、たまたま通りかかったテリーマンがその手刀を受け止めて阻止し、無言でにらみあって、その場はただそれだけで別れていくというシーン。</seg>
          <seg id="12">これの何がすごいって、どちらもすでに敗退していて、この大会内でキン肉マンと闘う機会はもうないんですよ。</seg>
          <seg id="13">でもそのキン肉マンをめぐってこんなひと悶もん着ちやくがある。</seg>
          <seg id="14">こんなの見せられたら、遠い未来の活躍に想いをはせずにはいられない！</seg>
          <seg id="15">キャラが立つというのはこういうことなんだと、僕も漫画家として今なお痛感させられる一幕です！</seg>
          <seg id="16">そんなふたりの闘いはそれほど尺を割かずに終わるんですが、名場面は試合後のラーメンマンの涙の訴え。</seg>
          <seg id="17">キン肉マンに向けた「神がかりの運の強さにだけはたよらないでくれ ！ ！ 」</seg>
          <seg id="18">というセリフです。</seg>
          <seg id="19">これはもう、作品そのものに対する壮大なメタ発言といいますか、これまで読者もキン肉マンは結局、主人公だから負けないし、実力じゃないところでなんとなく勝ってきてるなぁとうすうす感じていたと思うんです。</seg>
          <seg id="20">でもラーメンマンにこの発言をさせることで、ゆでたまご先生は自ら先んじてもうその手は使えないぞとくぎを刺してきた。</seg>
          <seg id="21">このひと言で読者は「あれ、じゃあキン肉マンはまさか実力でロビンを倒すの？</seg>
          <seg id="22">どうやって ？ 」</seg>
          <seg id="23">って先の見えない展開にまた想像をかき立てられるでしょうし、もうひとつ作家的な目線で見ると、ここは作品を作るゆでたまご先生が自分自身に縛りを課したも同然のセリフなんですよね。</seg>
          <seg id="24">これはすごいことをされたなぁと。</seg>
          <seg id="25">間違いなくこの巻の大きなポイントのひとつだと思います。</seg>

          <seg id="1">Oginuma X's Review of Kinnikuman (Comic Volume 4) (Weekly Playboy News) - Yahoo!News</seg>
          <seg id="2">The 20th Chojin Olympics, which began in volume 3, comes to a conclusion in volume 4!</seg>
          <seg id="3">Whilst the previous volume followed events all the way from the opening ceremony to the semi-finals, volume 4 focuses exclusively on one fight, but is still chock-full of action!</seg>
          <seg id="4">●Kinnikuman volume 4 review by Oginuma X: ★★★★★ (5/5 stars)  ●For true Chojin wrestlers, the fight begins before they even enter the ring!</seg>
          <seg id="5">To summarise, volume 4 focuses in detail on the final between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but I want to point out that that doesn't mean that it only looks at the match going on in the ring.</seg>
          <seg id="6">It starts with the pre-match ceremony, and goes on to depict diversionary battles and training scenes, which is a change from the previous volume, and it takes a long time before it gets onto the match itself, although that's not to say that it's dull.</seg>
          <seg id="7">You get a sense of tension building that this will be the fight of the century, which I think is directly connected to the reader's enjoyment, so I was impressed at the way the pace has been calculated in this way.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Even before the all important final, another highlight is the small final match between Terryman and Ramenman.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Not only is it a brilliant match, I personally like the scene beforehand when Ramenman is backstage: he is looking at a poster of Kinnikuman and announces, "It'll be my turn next!"</seg>
          <seg id="10">And he punctuates this statement by chopping at it.</seg>
          <seg id="11">However, Terryman just happens to be passing at this moment, and he catches Ramenman's hand in midair, and they glare at each other silently before leaving on their way, and that's the whole scene.</seg>
          <seg id="12">What's so poignant about this scene is the fact that both of them have already been eliminated, and no longer have the opportunity to face Kinnikuman in this tournament.</seg>
          <seg id="13">That notwithstanding, they still nearly come to blows over Kinnikuman.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Seeing this, I can't help but think about what's in store for them!</seg>
          <seg id="15">As a manga artist myself, it really made me feel keenly that this is what is meant by well-defined characters!</seg>
          <seg id="16">These two wrestlers' fight was over rather quickly, but what was memorable for me was Ramenman's tearful plea after the fight was over.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He implores Kinnikuman, "Don't simply rely on divine providence!"</seg>
          <seg id="18">What a line.</seg>
          <seg id="19">It's almost a perfect meta comment on the manga itself, as I think that readers will agree with me that it feels like Kinnikuman can't lose because he's the main character, and even at times when he's not fighting to the best of his ability he'll emerge victorious somehow or other.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But, by having Rameman speak this line, Yudetamago have tied their hands so they can't use some kind of deus ex machina to help Kinnikuman get out of the situation.</seg>
          <seg id="21">This line causes the reader to think, "What, so Kinnikuman has to beat Robin Mask using his strength alone?</seg>
          <seg id="22">Alright, how?"</seg>
          <seg id="23">Thus, not being able to predict the outcome fires up the reader's imagination and, looked at from the author's perspective, this line also has the effect of Yudetamago imposing a constraint on themselves.</seg>
          <seg id="24">I thought that was a really daring thing to do.</seg>
          <seg id="25">It is without a doubt one of the biggest things to occur in this volume.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Vol. 4] (Shukupre NEWS)</seg>
          <seg id="2">The 20th Choujin Olympics, which started with volume 3, is now complete with this volume 4!</seg>
          <seg id="3">In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted the entire Olympics from the opening to the semi-finals in one fell swoop, this volume focuses on just one match, and as a result, it is full of new tricks!</seg>
          <seg id="4">Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewed by Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●Chonin wrestling has already started before the matches!</seg>
          <seg id="5">In a nutshell, this volume 4 is a slow and careful depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to keep in mind is that this is by no means a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Starting from the signing ceremony, there is a lot of tension in the book, such as the mutual check-and-control battle and the training scene, but it is never boring.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The tension that gradually builds as the match of the century is about to begin is surely linked to the reader's growing tension, and even this period of time is a well-calculated performance that is truly admirable.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And before the important final, there is one more match that cannot be missed: the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Aside from the gorgeousness of the match-up card, my favorite part of the match was Ramenman's pre-match speech backstage, in which he said to a Kinnikuman poster, "It's my turn to take the prize! I'm going to get it! !</seg>
          <seg id="10">and tries to slap him with a chop.</seg>
          <seg id="11">But Terryman happens to be passing by and catches his hand and stops him, and they glare at each other silently and part ways with nothing more than that.</seg>
          <seg id="12">What's amazing about this is that both have already lost and have no more chance to fight Kinnikuman within this tournament.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But there is such an agonizing dispute over Kinnikuman.</seg>
          <seg id="14">When you see something like this, you can't help but think about his future career!</seg>
          <seg id="15">As a manga artist myself, I am still painfully aware that this is what it means to have a strong character!</seg>
          <seg id="16">The fight between the two ends without much time, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.</seg>
          <seg id="17">But the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful appeal to Kinnikuman after the fight, "Don't rely on the luck of the gods! Don't depend on the luck of the gods! !"</seg>
          <seg id="18">to Kinnikuman.</seg>
          <seg id="19">I think readers have always felt that Kinnikuman was the main character, that he never lost because he was the main character, and that he somehow won in a way that wasn't based on his strength.</seg>

          <seg id="3">In contrast to the previous volume, which drew everything from the opening to the semifinals all at once, it is full of new tricks because it focused on only one game!</seg>
          <seg id="4">● [Kinnikuman] Volume 4 review contributor name Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Choujin Pro Wrestling has already started even before the game!</seg>
          <seg id="5">In a nutshell, these 4 volumes are one book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman vs. Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it is by no means a volume that depicts only the game on the ring It means that there is no</seg>
          <seg id="6">Starting with the signing ceremony, it's hard to go to the game because it's completely different from that point, such as each other's traction battle and special training scenes, etc., but that's never boring either.</seg>
          <seg id="7">This feeling in the work, in which the sense of tension that the first game of the century will finally begin gradually increases, surely leads to an increase in the tension of readers, and I am amazed that even this period is a production that is actually calculated.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And before the important final, another mountain that you can't miss is the 3rd place match between Terry Man and Ramen Man.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In addition to the luxury of being a match card, what I like is that Ramen Man says to the Kinnikuman poster behind the scenes before the game, “From now on, it's my turn to aim for! ! ”</seg>
          <seg id="10">and try to slam the chops.</seg>
          <seg id="11">However, it is a scene where a terry man who happens to pass by accepts the hand sword and stops it, stares at each other silently, and breaks up with just that.</seg>
          <seg id="12">What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But there is such a person who wears agony around that Kinnikuman.</seg>
          <seg id="14">If something like this is shown, I can't help but think about the activities of the distant future!</seg>
          <seg id="15">It's one act that still makes me keenly aware as a manga artist that this is what it means for a character to stand up!</seg>
          <seg id="16">The battle between the two ends without dividing that much scale, but the famous scene is the tearful complaint of Ramen Man after the game.</seg>
          <seg id="17">To Kinnikuman, “Don't rely only on the strength of Kamikari's luck! ! ”</seg>
          <seg id="18">It's a line called.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Is this already called a grand meta statement against the work itself, until now, readers also feel that Kinnikuman won't lose because it's the main character after all, and it's somehow winning where it's not his ability I think it was.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But by making Ramen Man make this statement, Yudetamago-sensei took the lead on his own and stabbed a nail that he couldn't use his hands anymore.</seg>
          <seg id="21">With this one word, the reader said, “Oh, then will Kinnikuman defeat Robin with his ability?</seg>
          <seg id="22">How do you do it? ”</seg>
          <seg id="23">You will be able to stir up your imagination again by the unseen development in the future, and if you look at it from another writer's perspective, this is the same line that Yudetamago-sensei, who makes the work, imposed restrictions on himself.</seg>
          <seg id="24">I think this was an amazing thing to do.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [ Comics Volume 4 ] ( Weekly Pre-NEWS ) - Yahoo! News</seg>
          <seg id="2">The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in volume 3, will be completed in these four volumes!</seg>
          <seg id="3">In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted everything from the opening round to the semi-final at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focused on only one match!</seg>
          <seg id="4">- Kinnikuman Volume 4 Review Contributor Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) - Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!</seg>
          <seg id="5">In a nutshell, these four volumes are a thorough and careful depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that they are by no means volumes that only depict the matches in the ring.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Starting with the signing ceremony, there are times when the matches are different from before, such as the battle for restraint between the two sides and the scene of special training, but it is not boring at all.</seg>
          <seg id="7">This feeling of the gradual heightening of the tension that the battle of the century is about to begin is definitely connected to the heightened tension of the reader, and even this period is truly a calculated production.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And one more mountain before the important final, not to be overlooked is the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In addition to the luxury of the fight card, I like it because Ramenman shouts to Kinnikuman posters backstage before the game, "Now it's my turn to aim ! 」</seg>
          <seg id="10">and try to slap the chops.</seg>
          <seg id="11">However, the scene where Terryman, who happened to pass by, catches the sword and stops it, stares at each other silently, and the scene is just that they part.</seg>
          <seg id="12">What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated and there is no more opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But there's this kind of anguish over Kinnikuman that Kinnikuman is.</seg>
          <seg id="14">If you can show me something like this, I can't help but think about the activities of the distant future!</seg>
          <seg id="15">This is what it means for a character to stand, and as a manga artist, it is a scene that still makes me keenly aware even now!</seg>
          <seg id="16">The fight between the two ends without much length, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Directed at Kinnikuman "Don't rely solely on the strength of God's luck!" 」</seg>
          <seg id="18">That's the line.</seg>
          <seg id="19">This is already a grand meta-statement about the work itself, and I think that readers have felt faintly that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character after all, and that he has somehow won in places where it is not his ability.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But by having Ramenman make this statement, Boiled Egg Sensei took the initiative to stab his nails that he could no longer use his hands.</seg>
          <seg id="21">With these words, the reader may ask, "Oh, so Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin by force?"</seg>
          <seg id="22">How? 」</seg>
          <seg id="23">The uncertain development will stir your imagination again, and from another artist's point of view, this is a line that is almost as if the boiled egg teacher who makes the work imposed a bind on himself.</seg>
          <seg id="24">I thought you did a great job.</seg>
          <seg id="25">I think it's definitely one of the big points of this volume.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Starting with the signing ceremony, it's been hard to get into the game because of the mutual rivalry and the special training, but it's never been boring.</seg>
          <seg id="7">This feeling during the story, in which the tension gradually increases as the battle of the century is about to begin, is surely connected to the heightened tension of the reader, and I can't help but admire the fact that even this period is a very calculated production.</seg>

          <seg id="7">By that point, I thought it was that the fan started working poorly since the room temperature was down (6°C).</seg>
          <seg id="8">So I decided to try again when the room was warmed up.</seg>
          <seg id="9">3) It won't start up.</seg>
          <seg id="10">When I push the power button, the power light comes on and the fan starts to move just for a sec but it stops right away.</seg>
          <seg id="11">After that, there's nothing at all.</seg>
          <seg id="12">I take the power plug out and try again, but it still only turns on for a second.</seg>
          <seg id="13">4.) I try with all the parts disconnected from the motherboard except the ATX20 pin and the four-pin, but it won't start up.</seg>
          <seg id="14">5.) It had already been making a noise like duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh like the PSU fan was hitting something, so I kinda suspect the PSU is the cause.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Later I'll find a spare ATX power cable and try that.</seg>
