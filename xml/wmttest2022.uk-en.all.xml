          <seg id="2">Президент Володимир Зеленський вважає, що бої за схід України і, зокрема, за Маріуполь, визначать хід війни – і якщо ЗСУ зазнають там поразки, росіяни можуть покинути переговори і знову окупувати деокуповані території.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Пряма мова: "Маріуполь – це, знаєте, серце цієї війни на сьогодні.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Воно б’ється – ми воюємо, ми міцні.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Якщо воно перестане битися – у нас будуть більш слабкі позиції.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Вони (захисники міста – ред.) – люди, які відтягнули на себе велику кількість ворога.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Чим міцніша наша позиція в Маріуполі, тим міцніша наша позиція буде на сході держави, в (районі) ООС, і якщо вони будуть більш міцними, то і стіл перемовин буде для нас більш наближеним і у нас будуть переваги в діалозі з Російською Федерацією.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Якщо у нас ситуація буде слабка в усіх цих напрямках, то ми можемо не дочекатися на зустріч.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Тому що тоді Росія буде робити всі ці кроки, які можуть призвести до повернення навіть у ті міста, які ми зараз деокупували.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Вони можуть піти і на це.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Тоді вже наша ситуація в перемовинах буде слабша і, може, навіть не цікава для російської сторони.</seg>
          <seg id="12">На жаль, ми констатуємо.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Ми віримо в наш результат, у нашу перемогу…".</seg>
          <seg id="14">Деталі: Зеленський також сказав, що йти на переговори після катувань українців складно, але "ми повинні не втрачати можливості на дипломатичне вирішення, якщо вони в нас будуть".</seg>
          <seg id="15">Пряма мова: "Люди сприймуть мир у будь-якому випадку, тому що люди хочуть, щоб ця війна закінчилася.</seg>
          <seg id="16">На наших умовах, умовах незалежності України, але… кожна сім'я щось втратила – і я не думаю, що їх задовольнить будь-який мир на будь-яких умовах.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Але якщо ми говоримо не емоційно, війна повинна закінчитися миром, або закінчиться мільйонами жертв.</seg>
          <seg id="18">І навіть там, де мільйон жертв, все приходить до закінчення війни.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Direct speech: “You know, today Mariupol is the heart of this war.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It’s beating – we’re fighting, we are strong.</seg>

          <seg id="6">They (defenders of the city – ed.) are the people who have attracted a large number of enemies.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The stronger our position in Mariupol is, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the Joint Forces Operation area, and if they are stronger, then we’ll be closer to negotiations and will have advantages during the dialogue with the Russian Federation.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If our position is weak in all these areas, we may be unable to wait for the meeting.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Because in this case Russia will take all the steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have deoccupied for now.</seg>
          <seg id="10">They can go for it too.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Then our position during the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, even uninteresting for the Russian side.</seg>

          <seg id="13">We believe in our result, in our victory…”</seg>
          <seg id="14">Details: Mr. Zelenskyy also said that it is difficult to negotiate after tortures of the Ukrainians, but “we may not lose the opportunities for a diplomatic solution, if we have such.”</seg>

          <seg id="18">And even if there are millions of victims, the war comes to an end.</seg>

          <seg id="8">Бо був і лишаюсь абсолютно впевненим, що сутність гнилого комуно-КДБістського режиму залишилась незмінною з 1918-го року.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Без терору він просто не може існувати, він побудований на терорі.</seg>
          <seg id="10">У 1937-му році одного з моїх прадідів розстріляли у тюрмі міста Житомир.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Декілька років тому у житомирському СБУ дали зняти копію із розстрільної справи прадіда: вся справа понад сотню сторінок, а от вирок на страту дуже простий і від того ще більш страшний.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Обвинувачений був неписьменний, провину заперечував.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Етнічний поляк, католик, мав п'ятеро дітей, був з вільних людей, бідна "однодворова" шляхта, ніколи в кріпаках не ходили.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Той факт, що жили на хуторах і мали кілька корів, був достатнім аби прирікти пахаря і годівника малолітніх дітей до страти.</seg>

          <seg id="16">Бабуся казала, що з села тоді забрали майже сотню людей і вбили всіх окрім двох, які погодились давати лжесвідчення.</seg>

          <seg id="22">Аналізуючи справу прадіда, зацікавився різними інформаційними ресурсами.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Є на росії чудові (без сарказму) інформаційні ресурси на кшталт "Бессмертный барак", що якісно нагадують про події тих років.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Так от, в сучасній росії нащадки НКВДистів знайшли способи покарати і винищити майже всіх, хто серйозно розслідував злочини їхніх предків 70-80 років тому.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Людей, які знаходили масові могили жертв сталінських репресій і публічно писали імена вбивць, – система спочатку дискредитувала, а потім знищила.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Начебто на комп'ютері знайшли файли з дитячою порнографією, за неї посадили у в'язницю, а там вже швидко помер.</seg>
          <seg id="27">КДБісти і зараз вбивають тих, хто намагається дізнатись правду про злочини минулого століття.</seg>
          <seg id="28">То чого раптом ви дивуєтесь їхнім діям зараз?!</seg>
          <seg id="29">Там сконцентровано найбільш мерзенні риси людської натури.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Поверх тисячолітньої ординської традиції наклалися рабство й імперський шовінізм 16-19-го сторіч.</seg>
          <seg id="31">А потім над тим, що вийшло, зробили звірячий генетичний експеримент, вирізавши інтелігенцію під час декількох хвиль червоного терору.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Пів року тому в Меморіальному центрі Голокосту "Бабин Яр" у Києві ми вшановували 80 років масового розстрілу німецькими солдатами українських євреїв у Бабиному Яру.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Я мав честь виступати після трьох глав держав, серед яких був і президент Німеччини.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Він говорив про "спільну основу міжнародного права та людської гідності, свободу людей вибирати свій шлях і життя в територіальній цілісності, мирну та безпечну Європу.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Цю основу ми повинні захищати – це також частина нашої відповідальності, пов’язаної з нашою історією".</seg>
          <seg id="5">Якщо "злі демони минулого з’являться сьогодні в новому одязі, – сказав він, – то для нас, німців, на це може бути лише одна відповідь: ніколи більше!</seg>
          <seg id="6">Боротьба має тривати".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Сьогодні Росія напала на мирну країну, бомбить і вбиває тисячі мирних жителів, морить голодом жителів блокованих нею міст і дає їм померти від хвороб.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Російські війська здійснюють масові розстріли українців, навіть візуально це нагадує розстріли в Бабиному Яру.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Понад місяць німці бачать це в новинах у режимі реального часу.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Так, Німеччина впроваджує санкції, надає гуманітарну допомогу, а також зброю, що ще не так давно було неможливо уявити.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Німеччина відтягує доставку важкого озброєння, необхідного Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Але "Ніколи знову!" означає не тільки виступати проти свастики.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Це означає боротися всіма можливими засобами проти масових вбивств, геноциду, воєнних злочинів і звірств.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Немає легкого шляху без ризиків і жертв перемогти зло та зупинити звірства, що відбуваються в Україні.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Сергій Сидоренко: Наше членство в НАТО перестало бути далекою перспективою</seg>
          <seg id="2">9 років тому, українська соціологія показувала, що 67% українців були проти вступу в НАТО і тільки 18% опитаних виступали "за".</seg>
          <seg id="3">Після Революції Гідності, втечі Віктора Януковича, анексії Криму та початку війни Донбасі, кількість противників НАТО почала падати, а прихильників, навпаки, зростати.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Після початку повномасштабної війни з Росією українські соціологи зафіксували рекордний рівень підтримки вступу України до НАТО серед громадян України – понад 75%.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Незважаючи на підтримку вступу України в НАТО та ту допомогу, яку НАТО здійснює в умовах війни, зараз лунає багато критики на рахунок Альянсу та членів-країн – за несвоєчасне постачання зброї, відмову закривати небо, небажання "дратувати" Росію.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Окрім цього, існує великий ризик що Україна буде змушена відмовитись від прагнення членства в Альянсі через позицію РФ, якщо це зможе зупинити війну, а Україна отримає надійні безпекові гарантії, у тому числі й військові.</seg>
          <seg id="7">У новому епізоді подкасту "Кляті питання" разом з редактором "Європейської правди" говоримо про те, як саме допомагав Україні Альянс з моменту російського вторгнення, за що НАТО слід критикувати, а за що Альянс критикують даремно, чому наша перспектива членства у НАТО є близькою, як ніколи в історії та чому безпекові гарантії, які обговорюються на перемовинах з Росією, можуть стати другим Будапештським меморандумом.</seg>

          <seg id="2">9 years ago Ukrainian sociology studies showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% were in favor of this.</seg>
          <seg id="3">After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donbass the number of NATO opponents started falling, and, on the contrary, the number of its supporters increased.</seg>
          <seg id="4">After the start of a full-scale war against Russia Ukrainian sociologists recorded the highest level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Despite support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and NATO’s assistance during the war, now there is much criticism of the Alliance and its member countries for late delivery of weapons, refusal to close the skies, and unwillingness to “irritate” Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Besides, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce its aspiration to join the Alliance because of Russia’s position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military ones.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In the new episode of the “Bloody Questions” podcast we, together with the editor of the European Pravda, talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and what the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our NATO membership prospects has never been so close, and why security guarantees discussed during the negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.</seg>

          <seg id="2">«Повідомлення про вбитих, зґвалтованих і тяжко поранених російськими військами українських мирних жителів варті засудження», – заявила прем’єр-міністр Нової Зеландії Джасінда Ардерн журналістам у Веллінгтоні 4 квітня.</seg>
          <seg id="3">«Росія повинна відповісти перед світом за те, що вони зробили», – додала вона, зазначивши, що її уряд обговорить додаткові заходи для підтримки України в її боротьбі проти російського вторгнення.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Прем'єр-міністр Японії Фуміо Кісіда назвав інциденти «порушенням міжнародного права».</seg>
          <seg id="5">Заяви прозвучали після появи повідомлень про те, що сотні мирних жителів були розстріляні та скинуті в братські могили або залишені на вулицях у передмісті Києва, в Бучі російськими військами, які вийшли з цього району після окупації протягом кількох тижнів.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Фотографії, на яких нібито зображені тіла страчених цивільних зі зв’язаними руками, шокували багатьох і призвели до закликів до посилення санкцій проти Росії та кримінального переслідування винних.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Президент Франції Емманюель Макрон заявив в радіоінтерв’ю 4 квітня, що є ознаки того, що російські війська вчинили «воєнні злочини» в Бучі.</seg>
          <seg id="8">«Те, що сталося в Бучі, вимагає нового раунду санкцій і дуже чітких заходів», – сказав Макрон, додавши, що додаткові санкції мають бути спрямовані на російський експорт вугілля та нафти.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Прем'єр-міністр Іспанії Педро Санчес заявив, що російські війська можуть зайти так далеко, що вчинили «геноцид» у Бучі.</seg>
          <seg id="10">«Ми зробимо все, щоб ті, хто вчинив ці воєнні злочини, не залишилися безкарними», – сказав Санчес в Мадриді.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Виступаючи на державному телебаченні пізно 3 квітня, речниця МЗС Росії Марія Захарова відкинула звинувачення як «провокацію».</seg>
          <seg id="12">Вона без доказів заявила, що Сполучені Штати і НАТО «замовили» зображення, щоб дискредитувати Росію.</seg>
          <seg id="13">«У цьому випадку, мені здається, той факт, що ці заяви були зроблені в перші хвилини після появи цих матеріалів, не викликає жодних сумнівів у тому, хто «замовив» цю історію», – сказала Захарова.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Раніше Міноборони Росії також без доказів заявляло, що зображення Бучі є «ще одним постановкою київського режиму» і що всі російські війська покинули місто до 30 березня.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Москва попросила Раду безпеки ООН зібратися 4 квітня, щоб обговорити те, що вона назвала «провокацією українських радикалів» у Бучі.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Слідчий комітет Росії 4 квітня оприлюднив заяву, в якій оголосив про «розслідування» за звинуваченням у поширенні Україною «завідомо неправдивої інформації» про дії російських військ у Бучі.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Президент України Володимир Зеленський виступив 3 квітня, звинувативши російські війська у скоєнні «геноциду» в місті, і сказав керівникам Кремля, що вони мають приїхати до Бучі, щоб побачити, що зробили їхні військові.</seg>
          <seg id="18">«Я хочу, щоб усі керівники Російської Федерації бачили, як виконуються їхні накази», – сказав Зеленський у відеозверненні, переходячи з української мови на російську.</seg>
          <seg id="19">І є спільна відповідальність.</seg>
          <seg id="20">За ці вбивства, за ці тортури… За постріли в потилицю», – сказав він.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Він заявив, що президент Росії Володимир Путін і російські військові повинні нести відповідальність за дії військ в Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="22">«Коли ми знаходимо людей із зв’язаними за спиною руками та обезголовленими, я не розумію», – сказав він про сцени жертв, розкиданих на вулицях Бучі, міста приблизно в 35 кілометрах на північний захід від Києва.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Кореспондент Української служби Радіо Свобода 2 квітня побачив на вулицях невеликого міста тіла начебто цивільних.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Лише в одному місці кореспондент побачив на вулиці до 10 тіл.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Журналісти AP бачили тіла щонайменше 21 людини в різних місцях Бучі.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Тіла однієї групи з дев'яти людей – усі в цивільному – були розкидані на землі поблизу місця, яке, за словами місцевих жителів, використовували російські сили як базу.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Схоже, жертви були вбиті з близької відстані.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Загалом українська влада заявила, що тіла щонайменше 410 мирних жителів були знайдені в районі Києва, який до минулого тижня контролювався російськими військами.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Photos purportedly showing the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied have shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.</seg>
          <seg id="7">French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were indications that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."</seg>
          <seg id="12">She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.</seg>

          <seg id="1">"Їм сказали: Києва нема". Як окупанти підло вивозили українців у Росію та Білорусь</seg>
          <seg id="2">Російське вторгнення в Україну супроводжується страшними речами: грабунками, зґвалтуваннями, вбивствами, катуваннями.</seg>
          <seg id="3">У цьому переліку є ще один пункт, про який наразі є значно менше інформації – вивезення місцевого населення на територію ворога.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Приблизно з середини березня російські окупанти "евакуюють" українців з тимчасово окупованих населених пунктів на свою територію та територію Білорусі, яку самопроголошений президент Лукашенко фактично віддав під російський військовий полігон.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Українська правда" відшукала вивезених українців та їхніх родичів, щоб розпитати, як відбувається та сама "евакуація" та чи є способи повернутися після неї в Україну.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Герої цього тексту пристали на добровільно-примусову евакуацію за межі України під психологічним тиском і від безвиході.</seg>
          <seg id="7">На щастя, вони живі та підтримують зв'язок з рідними.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Втім, з огляду на заяви української влади, чимало громадян були вивезені в Росію та Білорусь під жорстким примусом.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Так у Мелітополі росіяни викрали персонал другого пологового будинку, вивезли звідти дітей без батьків, серед яких 12-річна Мирослава, дочка загиблого чемпіона України з плавання Йосипа Зачепинського.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Сім'я Олександра, Марини та їхньої 10-річної доньки Валі перебралася до Гостомеля за кілька місяців до війни.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Олександр саме отримав роботу в аеропорту "Антонов", що розташований за 2,5 кілометри від селища.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Родина оселилася на території військового містечка, хоч і була цивільною.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Як істинні пластуни, Денис та Марина заздалегідь зібрали тривожні валізки, але зранку 24-го лютого евакуюватися не встигли.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Свого авто в них не було, а приміські автобуси вже нікого не брали.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Приблизно о 12-ій годині дня 24-го лютого вони побачили вертольоти з латинською літерою V, слідом за якими прилетіли перші снаряди.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Один із них влучив у сусідній будинок.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Тоді родина спустилася в підвал і залишилася там на довгих три тижні, до 17-го березня, поки російські військові не вивезли їх у Білорусь.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Усього в їхньому підвалі переховувалися близько 40 осіб.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Їхати вирішили не всі.</seg>
          <seg id="20">"О 6-ій вечора 24-го лютого в під'їзд зайшли люди, які говорили і не по-російськи, і не по-українськи.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Питають: "Есть кто?" – Кажу, що так. – "Выходи!".</seg>
          <seg id="22">Вони мене обшукали, спитали, хто у підвалі, чи є зброя.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Усіх чоловіків допитували, чи вони служили в армії.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Жінкам сказали: "Ми прийшли вас захищати за вказівкою Рамзана Кадирова".</seg>
          <seg id="25">Це був чеченський ОМОН, навіть не війська, молоді хлопці років по 25-35.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Вони казали: "От нам у війні допомагали українці, Сашко Білий (командував загоном націоналістичного руху УНА-УНСО "Вікінг", що воював на боці чеченців у першій російсько-чеченській війні – УП), тепер ми вам допомагати прийшли".</seg>
          <seg id="27">На третій день вони спитали, чого нам не вистачає.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Ми кажемо, що води, з нею була велика проблема.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Вони розбили магазин, забрали звідти товар під приводом "все равно русские заберут" і принесли нам 6 бутлів.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Є ще в інтернеті відео, де діти дякують Кадирову за їжу.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Так це вони після розграбування магазину привезли ковбас і кажуть: "Ми розуміємо, що це неправильно, але нам дуже треба відео для Рамзана Ахматовича".</seg>
          <seg id="32">Говорити ніхто особливо не хотів, але вони зробили красиву нарізку.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Наша дитина там каже: "У вас є 7 днів, щоб віддати наші телефони" – вони посміялися.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Ще вони постійно відокремлювали себе від росіян.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Казали, як добре, що саме вони прийшли, бо вони ж то війни не хотіли, українців підтримують і взагалі хороші: "Путін – виродок, Кадиров теж, але ми нічого не можемо зробити, бо там наші сім'ї".</seg>
          <seg id="36">І в основному вони не воювали, а їздили грабувати магазини, мародерствували.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Курей собі навезли, одній прив'язали до однієї ноги георгіївську стрічку, а до іншої – свій білий скотч і називали її "ополченка".</seg>
          <seg id="38">В Україну вони приїхали зовсім не підготовлені.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Не знаю, як працювала їхня розвідка… Коли їх побили на Бучі, так, що вони навіть вбитих не забрали, то вони в нас питали: "У вас що, артилерія є?"</seg>
          <seg id="40">Більше того, у нас стояли зведені загони – чеченці між собою один одного не знали, у перші дні питали паролі, щоб виявити, свій чи чужий.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Вони в нас були до 13-го березня, після чого приїхав російський ОМОН, а за ними – омський десант.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Вони поставили 30-40 одиниць техніки між будинками – наші постійно попадали в неї з "Байрактарів".</seg>
          <seg id="43">Але ці приходили і розказували нам, що ЗСУ вже немає, але є "Азов", і, за їхніми словами, "Азову" так тисяч 100 в Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Наратив "Київ уже здався" просувався ще з початку березня.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Якось до нас прийшов росіянин – або офіцер десанту, або представник ФСБ – і каже, що буде евакуація.</seg>
          <seg id="46">А ми ж слухали радіо – там було про Бучу, Гостомель, думали, може і нам "зелений коридор" дали.</seg>
          <seg id="47">З самого початку ми передали чеченцям наші списки, вони обіцяли зв'язатися з українським командуванням.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Але нам кажуть: "Вас вивозять у Білорусь, а потім, можливо, у Ростов".</seg>
          <seg id="49">Ми говоримо, що не хочемо ні туди, ні туди.</seg>
          <seg id="50">На що вони відповідали: "То пожалійте психіку своїх дітей!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">Як це працювало: вони заганяли нас у підвал і починали стріляти з-під дому – чи "Градами", чи мінометами.</seg>
          <seg id="52">А потім прилітало назад… Сусідні будинки просто згоріли, частина з них завалилась.</seg>
          <seg id="53">У нашому будинку було пряме влучання у третій поверх.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Пізніше вони погодилися вивезти нас тільки в Білорусь, пообіцявши передати прикордонникам та Червоному Хресту.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Частина не поїхала, сказавши, що це для зрадників батьківщини – мовляв, "вас там розстріляють, на органи продадуть".</seg>
          <seg id="56">Нас повезли через Чорнобиль, по обох боках дороги були згарища, розбита техніка, хоча білоруси розказували, що росіяни техніку одразу до них вивозять.</seg>
          <seg id="57">Дуже багато капонірів, закопаної техніки та солдат.</seg>
          <seg id="58">На білоруському пункті пропуску "Комар" ми пройшли імпровізований контроль, багато хто був взагалі без документів, бо вони згоріли.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Нас розмістили у наметах Червоного Хреста, дали чаю.</seg>
          <seg id="60">І тут ми чуємо постріли! Стріляє ракета, і видно слід – це працював "Іскандер" по Києву.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Хоча ці з білоруського Червоного Хреста казали: "Та ні, це літаки літають, розвертаються на кордоні".</seg>
          <seg id="62">Але ж ми з авіації, маємо освіту, розуміємо, що це.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Далі нас погрузили в автобус і повезли в санаторій "Чонки" біля Гомеля.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Прийшов його керівник, Венгер Василь Степанович, каже: "Вот, я хохол, я с Чернигова.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Но я понимаю, что Путин с Лукашенком не остановятся, пока этих ваших воров не добьют.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Бедный народ страдает!</seg>
          <seg id="67">А у нас Лукашенко такой хороший!</seg>
          <seg id="68">Он как скажет, так и будет".</seg>
          <seg id="69">Пропонували дати інтерв'ю білоруським журналістам, але ніхто не схотів.</seg>
          <seg id="70">Адміністрація санаторію казала нам: "Та ви вже зрадники!"</seg>
          <seg id="71">А люди від Червоного Хреста та представництва ООН (принаймні вони так називалися) поширювали дезінформацію, що чоловікам у Польщу їхати не можна.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Багато хто в це повірив і побоявся виїхати з Білорусі.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Але ми таки вирішили виїжджати, хоч і мали проблему з документами – у доньки не було закордонного паспорта.</seg>
          <seg id="74">Ми мали його в понеділок отримувати, а в четвер почалася війна.</seg>
          <seg id="75">В українському консульстві нам нічим не допомогли, а в Мінську на вокзалі сказали, що без паспортів ніхто нікого в автобус не візьме.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Тут скажу, що нам дуже допомагали білоруські волонтери.</seg>
          <seg id="77">Нас і поселили в Мінську, і супровід здійснювали.</seg>
          <seg id="78">У санаторії силою не тримали.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Нашій другій групі міграційний представник сказав, що ви тут можете пожити максимум тиждень-півтора, бо Білорусь – це не Європа, виплат тут ніяких немає.</seg>
          <seg id="80">Ми знайшли внутрішнього перевізника, який зголосився вивезти нас у Варшаву.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Проїжджаючи біля Мозиря (приблизно 50 кілометрів від українського кордону – УП), ми бачили запуски балістичних ракет по Україні: ракета спочатку вилітає, красиво світиться, а потім гасне.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Люди, які сідали на автобус у Мозирі, розповідали, що росіяни там постійно стріляють з полігонів.</seg>
          <seg id="83">Але можу сказати, що білоруси воювати абсолютно не хочуть.</seg>
          <seg id="84">З армії звільняються генерали.</seg>
          <seg id="85">Одна жінка нам сказала, що зламає щось сину, якщо його призиватимуть.</seg>

          <seg id="1">“They were told: there is no Kyiv.” How the occupiers meanly took the Ukrainian to Russian and Belarus</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Russian invasion into Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, raping, murders and tortures.</seg>
          <seg id="3">This list contains another item about which currently there is much less information – deportation of local inhabitants to the enemy’s territory.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Starting from around mid-March, the Russian occupiers “evacuate” the Ukrainians from temporarily occupied centers of population to their territory and the territory of Belarus that the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually handed over to use as a Russian military training area.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“Ukrainska Pravda” found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the “evacuation” itself is taking place and if there are any ways to return to Ukraine after it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The heroes of this article agreed to a 	voluntary-compulsory evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and because of hopelessness.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, taking into account statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Thus, in Melitopol the Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, took orphans from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The family of Oleksandr, Maryna and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It was when Oleksandr got a job at the “Antonov” airport located 2.5 kilometers away from the town.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The family started living on the premises of a military town, though they were civilians.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Like true scouts Denys and Maryna packed their survival kits in advance, but did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They did not have their own car, and suburban buses did not take any passengers anymore.</seg>
          <seg id="15">At about 12 o’clock on February 24 they noticed helicopters with the Latin letter V followed by the first shells.</seg>
          <seg id="16">One of them hit a neighboring house.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Then the family went downstairs to the basement and remained there for three long weeks until March 17, till the Russian military deported them to Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In total about 40 people were hiding in their basement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Not all the people decided to leave.</seg>
          <seg id="20">“At 6 pm on February 24 some people who spoke neither Russian, nor Ukrainian entered the house.</seg>
          <seg id="21">They asked: “Is anybody here?” – I said “yes”. – “Get out!”</seg>
          <seg id="22">They searched me and asked who was in the basement, and if there were any weapons there.</seg>
          <seg id="23">They interrogated all the men about if they had served in the army.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Women were told the following: “We’ve come to protect you, as Ramzan Kadyrov instructed.”</seg>
          <seg id="25">It was a Chechen special police squad, not even military troops, young men aged 25–35.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They said: “The Ukrainians helped us during the war, Sashko Bilyi (commander of the “Viking” detachment of the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war – “Ukrainska Pravda”), now we’ve come to help you.”</seg>
          <seg id="27">On the third day they asked what we were short of.</seg>
          <seg id="28">We said about water, there was a big problem with it.</seg>
          <seg id="29">They broke into a shop, took the goods from there explaining that “the Russians will still take everything away” and brought us 6 bottles of water.</seg>
          <seg id="30">There is also a video online where children thank Kadyrov for food.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Yes, they brought some sausages after looting a shop and said: “We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.”</seg>
          <seg id="32">Nobody wanted to talk a lot, but they made a beautiful footage.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Our child says there: “You have 7 days to give our phones back,” – they laughed at that.</seg>
          <seg id="34">They also constantly claimed that they were different from the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="35">They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want a war, they support the Ukrainians and are good in general: “Putin is a degenerate, and Kadyrov too, but there is nothing we can do, because our families are there.”</seg>
          <seg id="36">And mainly they did not fight, but were robbing shops and looting.</seg>
          <seg id="37">They took some chickens, tied a ribbon of Saint George to one leg, and their white sticky tape to the other, and called her “militia woman.”</seg>
          <seg id="38">They came to Ukraine without any training.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I don’t know how their reconnaissance parties worked… When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they didn’t even take the dead, they asked us: “Do you even have artillery?”</seg>
          <seg id="40">Moreover, there were consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether the people were their or the enemy’s fighters.</seg>
          <seg id="41">They stayed with us until March 13, after that the Russian special police squad arrived, followed by the Omsk landing party.</seg>
          <seg id="42">They put 30–40 units of equipment between the houses – our soldiers constantly hit them from “Bayraktars.”</seg>
          <seg id="43">But they came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exist, but there was the Azov Regiment with around 100,000 soldiers in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">They have been constantly saying “Kyiv has already surrendered” since early March.</seg>
          <seg id="45">One day a Russian came to us – either a landing party officer or a representative of the Federal Security Service – and said that evacuation would be held.</seg>
          <seg id="46">And we listened to the radio – it said about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought that a “green corridor” might be provided for us.</seg>
          <seg id="47">From the very beginning we handed over our lists to the Chechens who promised to contact the Ukrainian military leaders.</seg>
          <seg id="48">But we were told: “You are being taken to Belarus, and then possibly to Rostov.”</seg>
          <seg id="49">We said that we didn’t want to go there.</seg>
          <seg id="50">But they answered: “Thing about mental health of your children!”</seg>
          <seg id="51">It worked this way: they drove us into the basement and started firing from under the house – with either “Grads” or mortars.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And then it flew back… Neighboring houses were just burned down, some of them collapsed.</seg>
          <seg id="53">There was a direct hit at the third floor in our house.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus and promised to hand us over to border guards and the Red Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Some people did not go saying that it was for traitors of the homeland – they said that “you would be shot there and sold for organs.”</seg>
          <seg id="56">They were driving us through Chernobyl, there were sites of fire and broken vehicles on both sides of the road, though the Belarusians said that the Russians were taking the vehicles to them immediately.</seg>
          <seg id="57">There were a lot of caponniers, buried vehicles and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian “Komar” checkpoint we passed an impromptu check, many people were without documents at all, because they were burned.</seg>
          <seg id="59">They placed us in the tents of the Red Cross and gave some tea.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And then we hear shots! A missile is launched, and a trace is visible – “Iskander” was launched at Kyiv.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Though people from the Belarusian Red Cross said: “No, these are planes flying and turning around at the border.”</seg>
          <seg id="62">But we work with aircrafts and have education, so we understand what it is.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the “Chonki” sanatorium near Gomel.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Its head, Vasyl Stepanovych Wenger, came and said: “I’m a Uke from Chernihiv.</seg>
          <seg id="65">But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won’t stop, until they kill those thieves of yours.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Poor people are suffering!</seg>
          <seg id="67">And our Lukashenko is so good!</seg>
          <seg id="68">Everything will be as he says.”</seg>
          <seg id="69">We were offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to do it.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us: “You are already traitors!”</seg>
          <seg id="71">And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations office (at least they called themselves so) were spreading misinformation that men could not go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">A lot of people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we decided to leave, though we had problems with documents – my daughter did not have a foreign travel passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We should have received it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="75">The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the train station we were told that people without passports wouldn’t be taken in a bus.</seg>
          <seg id="76">I will say here that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.</seg>
          <seg id="77">They lodged and escorted us in Minsk.</seg>
          <seg id="78">We were not forced to stay in the sanatorium.</seg>
          <seg id="79">The migration representative told our second group that they could live here for a week and at most, because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found a domestic carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Passing Mazyr (about 50 kilometers away from the Ukrainian border – “Ukrainska Pravda”), we saw ballistic missiles launched at Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then dies out.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People who boarded a bus in Mazyr said that the Russians were constantly firing there from firing grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Generals resign from the army.</seg>
          <seg id="85">One woman told us that she would injure her son if he was called up for military service.</seg>
          <seg id="86">However, in the northern part of Belarus where Minsk is located nobody believes this at all.</seg>
          <seg id="87">They say: “You are lying, we are a peaceful people.”</seg>
          <seg id="88">They do not believe that their firing grounds are used for shooting at Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="89">In Poland our friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Now we are passing registration and deciding what to do next.</seg>
          <seg id="91">Now there are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia, as there are Estonian ones.”</seg>
          <seg id="92">Maryna lived on the premises of a military town in Hostomel with her brother’s family – his wife and two children aged 18 and 22.</seg>
          <seg id="93">In the morning on February 24 she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In the evening they went to the basement of a neighboring house to spend the night.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Maryna herself could not return home and won’t be able to – there’s already no house.</seg>
          <seg id="96">Nobody really knew anything about evacuation.</seg>

          <seg id="43">But this came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there are "Azov", and, in their words, "Azov" is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.</seg>

          <seg id="50">What they said, "You will regret the psychology of your children!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">As it worked: they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house – either "Cradles" or mortars.</seg>

          <seg id="57">A lot of captains, digged equipment and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian "Komar" crossing point, we have undergone improved control, many were undocumented because they burned.</seg>

          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"</seg>
          <seg id="71">People from the Red Cross and UN representations (at least they were called) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Many believed in it and feared to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we so decided to leave, although they had a problem with documents – the daughter had no foreign passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We had to get it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.</seg>
          <seg id="75">In the Ukrainian Consulate we did not help anything, but in Minsk at the train station said that no one will take anyone in the bus without passports.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Here I will say that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.</seg>
          <seg id="77">We were settled in Minsk and escorted.</seg>
          <seg id="78">The sanatorium did not hold power.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Our second group migration representative said you can live for a maximum of a week and a half here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found an internal carrier who voted to bring us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Going near Mozyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw launching ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first flies, beautifully shines, and then shines.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People sitting on a bus in Mozir told that the Russians were constantly shooting from the fields there.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight completely.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.</seg>
          <seg id="3">In this list, there is another item, which is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to the enemy territory.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Ukrayinska Pravda" has found exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.</seg>
          <seg id="9">So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Yosyp Zachepynsky.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.</seg>
          <seg id="13">As true Plast members, Denys and Maryna collected alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They did not have their own cars, and suburban buses did not take anyone anymore.</seg>
          <seg id="15">At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.</seg>
          <seg id="16">One of them hit a nearby house.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Not everyone decided to go.</seg>
          <seg id="20">"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke both non-Russian and non-Ukrainian came to the entrance.</seg>
          <seg id="21">They asked: "Who is there?" - I said yes. - "Come out!."</seg>
          <seg id="22">They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, whether there were weapons.</seg>
          <seg id="23">All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."</seg>
          <seg id="25">It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys 25-35 years old.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO" Viking, "who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."</seg>
          <seg id="27">On the third day, they asked what we were missing.</seg>
          <seg id="28">We say that water, it was a big problem.</seg>
          <seg id="29">They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.</seg>
          <seg id="30">There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.</seg>
          <seg id="31">So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."</seg>
          <seg id="32">Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="35">They said it was good that they came because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing because our families are there."</seg>
          <seg id="36">And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looting.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Chickens brought himself, one tied to one leg St. George ribbon, and the other - his white Scotch tape and called it "Opolchenka".</seg>
          <seg id="38">They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"</seg>
          <seg id="40">Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to reveal their own or someone else's.</seg>
          <seg id="41">They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, and behind them - the Omsk landing.</seg>
          <seg id="42">They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - our constantly got into it from the "Bayraktars".</seg>
          <seg id="43">But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is 100 thousand in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been moving since the beginning of March.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.</seg>
          <seg id="46">And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor."</seg>
          <seg id="47">From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.</seg>
          <seg id="48">But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."</seg>
          <seg id="49">We say that we do not want either there or there.</seg>
          <seg id="50">To which they answered: "Pity the psyche of your children!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">How it worked: they drove us into the basement and began to shoot from under the house - or "Grad", or mortars.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And then came back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.</seg>
          <seg id="53">In our house there was a direct hit in the third floor.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer to the border guards and the Red Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Some did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland - they say, "you will be shot there, the organs will be sold."</seg>
          <seg id="56">We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were fires, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that Russian equipment was immediately taken to them.</seg>
          <seg id="57">A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.</seg>
          <seg id="59">We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And here we hear the shots! The rocket shoots, and a trace is visible - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around on the border."</seg>
          <seg id="62">But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonky" near Gomel.</seg>
          <seg id="64">His head, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here, I am a hohol, I am from Chernihiv.</seg>
          <seg id="65">But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they reach your goal.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Poor people are suffering!</seg>
          <seg id="67">And we have Lukashenko so good!</seg>
          <seg id="68">As he says, it will be so. "</seg>
          <seg id="69">They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"</seg>
          <seg id="71">And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were called so) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We had to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="75">In the Ukrainian Consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station said that without passports no one in the bus will not take.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.</seg>
          <seg id="77">We were settled in Minsk and escorted.</seg>
          <seg id="78">The sanatorium was not held by force.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People who boarded the bus in Mozyr, said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from landfills.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Generals are dismissed from the army.</seg>
          <seg id="85">One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called up.</seg>
          <seg id="86">However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe.</seg>
          <seg id="87">They say, "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."</seg>
          <seg id="88">They do not perceive that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="89">In Poland were waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.</seg>
          <seg id="3">There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Ukrayinska Pravda" found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" takes place and whether there are ways to return to the Ukraine after it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.</seg>
          <seg id="9">So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, removed children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Alexander just got a job at the antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.</seg>
          <seg id="13">As true Plast members, Denis and Marina packed alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.</seg>
          <seg id="15">At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.</seg>
          <seg id="16">One of them hit a nearby house.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Not everyone decided to go.</seg>
          <seg id="20">"At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke both not Russian and not Ukrainian came into the entrance.</seg>
          <seg id="21">They ask: "Who is there?" – I say that yes. - "Come out!".</seg>
          <seg id="22">They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.</seg>
          <seg id="23">All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The women were told: "We came to protect you at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov."</seg>
          <seg id="25">It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They said: "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (who commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."</seg>
          <seg id="27">On the third day, they asked what we were missing.</seg>
          <seg id="28">We say water, there was a big problem with it.</seg>
          <seg id="29">They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all equally Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.</seg>
          <seg id="30">There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.</seg>
          <seg id="31">So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."</seg>
          <seg id="32">No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" – they laughed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="35">They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want a war, ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."</seg>
          <seg id="36">And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, loot.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other – their white tape and called it "militia".</seg>
          <seg id="38">In Ukraine, they arrived completely unprepared.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have what, artillery?"</seg>
          <seg id="40">Moreover, we had consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other among themselves, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.</seg>
          <seg id="41">We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.</seg>
          <seg id="42">They delivered 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses – ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktar.</seg>
          <seg id="43">But these came and told us that the Armed Forces are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so many thousands in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Once a Russian came to us – either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB – and said that there would be an evacuation.</seg>
          <seg id="46">And we listened to the radio – it was about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".</seg>
          <seg id="47">From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.</seg>
          <seg id="48">But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov."</seg>
          <seg id="49">We say we don't want to go there or there.</seg>
          <seg id="50">To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – either with Grads or mortars.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.</seg>
          <seg id="53">There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland – they say, "you will be shot there, they will be sold to the organs."</seg>
          <seg id="56">We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.</seg>
          <seg id="57">A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar", we passed an improvised control, many were completely undocumented, because they burned down.</seg>
          <seg id="59">We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And here we hear gunshots! A rocket shoots, and a trace is visible – iskander worked in Kyiv.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."</seg>
          <seg id="62">But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.</seg>
          <seg id="64">His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I am a khokhol, I am from Chernigov.</seg>
          <seg id="65">But I believe that Putin with Lukashenko is not established, пока этих ваших воров не dobeьют.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Bad people suffer!</seg>
          <seg id="67">And here Lukashenko is so good!</seg>
          <seg id="68">He said, so be it."</seg>
          <seg id="69">They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"</seg>
          <seg id="71">And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Many believed in this and were afraid to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – my daughter did not have a passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.</seg>
          <seg id="75">The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.</seg>
          <seg id="77">We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In the sanatorium they did not keep it by force.</seg>
          <seg id="79">To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw ballistic missile launches across Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People who boarded a bus in Mozyr said that Russians there were constantly shooting from training grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Generals are dismissed from the army.</seg>
          <seg id="85">One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was drafted.</seg>
          <seg id="86">However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.</seg>
          <seg id="87">They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."</seg>
          <seg id="88">They do not accept that their landfills are used to shell Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.</seg>

          <seg id="1">“They were told: There is no Kiev.” How invaders sneakly exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.</seg>
          <seg id="3">There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information — the removal of local population to the enemy's territory.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Since mid-March, Russian occupiers have been “evacuating” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“Ukrainska Pravda” found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” is going on and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The heroes of this text came to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.</seg>
          <seg id="9">So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Alexander got a job at the airport “Antonov”, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.</seg>
          <seg id="13">As true plastuns, Denis and Marina in advance collected alarming suitcases, but in the morning of February 24 did not have time to evacuate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The car in them wasn't, and suburban buses already took nobody.</seg>
          <seg id="15">At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.</seg>
          <seg id="16">One of them hit the next house.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Not everyone decided to go.</seg>
          <seg id="20">“At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke not in Russian and not Ukrainian entered the entrance.</seg>
          <seg id="21">They ask: “There is someone?” — I say yes. — “Come out!”.</seg>
          <seg id="22">They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.</seg>
          <seg id="23">All men were interrogated, whether they served in army.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Women were told: “We came to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov.”</seg>
          <seg id="25">It was the Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They said: “Here we were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (commanded the detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO “Viking”, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we came to help you.”</seg>
          <seg id="27">On the third day, they asked what we were missing.</seg>
          <seg id="28">We say that water, it was a big problem.</seg>
          <seg id="29">They broke shop, took away from there goods under the pretext “all the same Russians will take away” and brought us 6 bottles.</seg>
          <seg id="30">There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.</seg>
          <seg id="31">So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: “We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.”</seg>
          <seg id="32">Nobody really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give our phones” — they laughed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="35">They said how good it was they who came, because they did not want wars, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: “Putin is a freak, Kadyrov, too, but we can do nothing because our families are there.”</seg>
          <seg id="36">And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other — their white scotch tape and called it “militia”.</seg>
          <seg id="38">They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: “Do you have artillery?”</seg>
          <seg id="40">Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if their own or someone else's.</seg>
          <seg id="41">We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.</seg>
          <seg id="42">They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses — ours constantly got into it from Bayraktarov.</seg>
          <seg id="43">But these came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there is “Azov”, and, according to them, “Azov” so 100 thousand in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The narrative “Kyiv has already surrendered” has been promoted since the beginning of March.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Somehow a Russian came to us — either an officer of the landing troops, or a representative of the FSB — and says that there will be an evacuation.</seg>
          <seg id="46">And we listened to the radio — there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe we were given a “green corridor”.</seg>
          <seg id="47">From the very beginning we handed over to the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.</seg>
          <seg id="48">But we are told: “You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov.”</seg>
          <seg id="49">We say that we do not want neither there nor there.</seg>
          <seg id="50">To which they answered: “Pity the psyche of your children!”</seg>
          <seg id="51">How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house — either Gradami or mortars.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.</seg>
          <seg id="53">In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Some did not leave, saying that this is for traitors of the homeland - they say, “you will be shot there, they will sell them to the authorities.”</seg>
          <seg id="56">We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnout, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians told that the Russians immediately took out the equipment to them.</seg>
          <seg id="57">A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian checkpoint “Komar” we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.</seg>
          <seg id="59">We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, given tea.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And here we hear shots! The rocket shoots, and you can see a trace — it worked “Iskander” in Kiev.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, “No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border.”</seg>
          <seg id="62">But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Then we were loaded on a bus and taken to the sanatorium “Chonki” near Gomel.</seg>
          <seg id="64">His leader, Vasily Stepanovich Venger, came, said: “Here, I'm a crest, I'm from Chernigov.</seg>
          <seg id="65">But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these of your theirs are finished.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Poorish people are suffering!</seg>
          <seg id="67">And Lukashenka is so good at us!</seg>
          <seg id="68">He will say so.”</seg>
          <seg id="69">They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us: “You are already traitors!”</seg>
          <seg id="71">And people from the Red Cross and the UN Mission (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men could not go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We had it on Monday to receive, and on Thursday the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="75">The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Here I will tell that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.</seg>
          <seg id="77">We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In sanatorium force didn't hold.</seg>
          <seg id="79">To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border — UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People who took the bus in Mozyr, told that Russians there constantly shoot from landfills.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Generals are released from the army.</seg>
          <seg id="85">One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was being brought in.</seg>
          <seg id="86">However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.</seg>
          <seg id="87">They say, “You lie, we are peaceful people.”</seg>
          <seg id="88">They do not perceive that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Friends were waiting for Poland, who took us to Estonia.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Now we are registering, we decide what we will do next.</seg>
          <seg id="91">In Estonia, there are now, probably, as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian ones.”</seg>

          <seg id="1">"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How occupants sneakily took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.</seg>
          <seg id="3">There is one more point in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Since about mid-March, Russian invaders have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave over to the Russian military training ground.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Ukrayinska Pravda found the Ukrainians and their relatives who were taken out to ask how the same "evacuation" was taking place and whether there were any ways to return to Ukraine after it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The heroes of this text adhered to the voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.</seg>
          <seg id="9">So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Alexander just got a job at the Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Like the true Plast members, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24 they did not have time to evacuate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They did not have their own car, and suburban buses did not take anyone.</seg>
          <seg id="15">At about 12 noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.</seg>
          <seg id="16">One of them hit a nearby house.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Not everyone decided to go.</seg>
          <seg id="20">"At 6 pm on February 24, people came into the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.</seg>
          <seg id="21">They ask: "Who is there?" - I say that yes. - "Come out!"</seg>
          <seg id="22">They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.</seg>
          <seg id="23">All the men were questioned whether they had served in the army.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The women were told: "We came to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."</seg>
          <seg id="25">It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They said: "Here Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bely (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO" Viking, "who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."</seg>
          <seg id="27">On the third day, they asked what we were missing.</seg>
          <seg id="28">We say water, there was a big problem with it.</seg>
          <seg id="29">They broke up the store, took away the goods from there under the pretext "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.</seg>
          <seg id="30">There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.</seg>
          <seg id="31">So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."</seg>
          <seg id="32">Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="35">They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can not do anything, because our families are there."</seg>
          <seg id="36">And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.</seg>
          <seg id="37">They brought chickens to themselves, one tied a St. George ribbon to one leg, and to the other - their white scotch tape and called it "opolchenko."</seg>
          <seg id="38">They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"</seg>
          <seg id="40">Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.</seg>
          <seg id="41">We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.</seg>
          <seg id="42">They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktari.</seg>
          <seg id="43">But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is thousands of 100 in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.</seg>
          <seg id="46">And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they gave us a "green corridor."</seg>
          <seg id="47">From the very beginning, we gave our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.</seg>
          <seg id="48">But they tell us: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."</seg>
          <seg id="49">We say that we do not want to go there or there.</seg>
          <seg id="50">To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grad or mortars.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and the Red Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to the homeland - they say, "they will shoot you there, they will sell you to the authorities."</seg>
          <seg id="56">We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burned out, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took equipment to them.</seg>
          <seg id="57">A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.</seg>
          <seg id="59">We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And then we hear gunshots! A rocket shoots, and a trace is visible - Iskander worked in Kyiv.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "Yes, no, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."</seg>
          <seg id="62">But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the Chonki sanatorium near Gomel.</seg>
          <seg id="64">His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I'm crest, I'm with Chernigov.</seg>
          <seg id="65">But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves get you.</seg>
          <seg id="66">The poor people are suffering!</seg>
          <seg id="67">And we have Lukashenko so good!</seg>
          <seg id="68">As he says, so be it. "</seg>
          <seg id="69">They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are traitors!"</seg>
          <seg id="71">And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="75">The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.</seg>
          <seg id="77">We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.</seg>
          <seg id="78">The sanatorium was not kept by force.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there constantly shoot from landfills.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Generals are dismissed from the army.</seg>

          <seg id="1">"they were told: Kyiv is gone." how the occupiers despicably deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.</seg>
          <seg id="3">There is one more item in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to enemy territory.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to a Russian military training ground.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Ukrainian Pravda" sought out the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The heroes of this text insisted on voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and because of hopelessness.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, according to the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the fallen Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepinskyi.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The family of Oleksandr, Maryna and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Oleksandr got a job at Antonov Airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was a civilian.</seg>
          <seg id="13">As true sleuths, Denys and Marina packed their emergency suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.</seg>
          <seg id="15">At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.</seg>
          <seg id="16">One of them hit a nearby house.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Not everyone decided to go.</seg>
          <seg id="20">"at 6 o'clock in the evening on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.</seg>
          <seg id="21">They ask: "is there anyone?" - I say yes. - "Get out!."</seg>
          <seg id="22">They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.</seg>
          <seg id="23">All men were asked if they had served in the army.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The women were told: "we have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."</seg>
          <seg id="25">It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young boys aged 25-35.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Belyy (commander of the unit of the nationalist UNA-UNSO" Viking "movement, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."</seg>
          <seg id="27">On the third day, they asked what we were missing.</seg>
          <seg id="28">We say that water, there was a big problem with it.</seg>
          <seg id="29">They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext that "the Russians will take them anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.</seg>
          <seg id="30">There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.</seg>
          <seg id="31">So, after looting the store, they brought sausage and said: "we understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."</seg>
          <seg id="32">No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Our child there says: "you have 7 days to return our phones" - they laughed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="35">They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, so is Kadyrov, but we can't do anything because our families are there."</seg>
          <seg id="36">And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.</seg>
          <seg id="37">They brought in chickens, tied a St. George's ribbon to one leg, and their white scotch tape to the other and called her "militia."</seg>
          <seg id="38">They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Buchi, so that they didn't even take the killed, they asked us: "do you have artillery?"</seg>
          <seg id="40">Moreover, we had united squads - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.</seg>
          <seg id="41">We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.</seg>
          <seg id="42">They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from "Bayraktars."</seg>
          <seg id="43">But they came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exists, but there is Azov, and, according to them, there are 100,000 Azov in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Once a Russian came to us - either an airborne officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.</seg>
          <seg id="46">And we listened to the radio - there was talk about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor."</seg>
          <seg id="47">From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.</seg>
          <seg id="48">But they tell us: "you will be taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."</seg>
          <seg id="49">We say we don't want to go there or there.</seg>
          <seg id="50">To which they replied: "then take pity on the psyche of your children!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grads or mortars.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Some did not go, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland - they said, "you will be shot there, sold for organs."</seg>
          <seg id="56">We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.</seg>
          <seg id="57">A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they were burned.</seg>
          <seg id="59">We were accommodated in Red Cross tents, given tea.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And then we hear shots! a rocket fires, and a trace is visible - it was "Iskander" operating in Kyiv.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "no, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."</seg>
          <seg id="62">But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Then we were put on a bus and taken to the "Chonky" sanatorium near Gomel.</seg>
          <seg id="64">His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "here, I'm a Hohol, I'm from Chernihiv.</seg>
          <seg id="65">But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are finished.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Poor people are suffering!</seg>
          <seg id="67">And our Lukashenko is so good!</seg>
          <seg id="68">As he says, so it will be. "</seg>
          <seg id="69">They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The administration of the sanatorium told us: "but you are already traitors!"</seg>
          <seg id="71">And people from the Red Cross and the UN representative office (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men can't go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="73">But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with documents - my daughter did not have a foreign passport.</seg>
          <seg id="74">We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.</seg>
          <seg id="75">They did not help us at the Ukrainian consulate, and in Minsk at the train station they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Here I will say that we were helped a lot by Belarusian volunteers.</seg>
          <seg id="77">We were accommodated in Minsk, and escorted.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In the sanatorium, they were not held by force.</seg>
          <seg id="79">The migration representative told our second group that you can live here for a week or a half at most, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.</seg>
          <seg id="80">We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Driving near Mozyry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.</seg>
          <seg id="82">People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly shooting from firing ranges there.</seg>
          <seg id="83">But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Generals resign from the army.</seg>
          <seg id="85">One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.</seg>
          <seg id="86">However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, they do not believe at all.</seg>
          <seg id="87">They say: "you are lying, we are a peaceful people."</seg>
          <seg id="88">They do not perceive that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Now we are going through registration, we are deciding what we will do next.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian flags. "</seg>

          <seg id="3">Джерело: twitter-сторінка Ейдіна Ейсліна, британця, що служив у лавах ЗСУ з 2018 року, ВВС з посиланням на членів родини й друзів Ейсліна, Atlas News з посиланням на слова друга Ейсліна, який поговорив із ним</seg>
          <seg id="4">Дослівно twitter Ейсліна: "Ми отримали звістку від нього: "Минуло 48 днів, ми спробували все можливе, щоби захистити Маріуполь, але в нас немає вибору, окрім здачі в полон до російських військ.</seg>
          <seg id="5">У нас не лишилося їжі та боєприпасів.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Дякую всім, сподіваюся, що війна незабаром закінчиться".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Деталі: Ейслін служив у 36-й окремій бригаді морської піхоти ЗСУ, яка бере участь в оборонній операції Маріуполя.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Журналісти ВВС зв’язалися з матір’ю військовослужбовця Ен Вуд, і вона підтвердила, що по телефону її син повідомив, що вони планують здаватися в полон.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Друг військового Бренан Філіпс також підтвердив журналістам, що в останній телефонній розмові Айслін сказав про плани їхнього підрозділу з капітуляції.</seg>
          <seg id="10">За його словами, у бригади закінчилися боєприпаси та їжа.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Минулого тижня Верховна Рада ухвалила законопроєкт 7176, який має назву "Щодо здійснення моніторингу потенційних загроз національній безпеці України у сфері економіки".</seg>
          <seg id="2">Дивно, що по суті єдиною потенційною загрозою національній безпеці України у сфері економіки виявилося… місце, за ким проводять засідання члени наглядової ради держкомпаній та держбанків.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Ініціатори законопроєкту вважають, що прийняття рішень наглядовою радою держкомпанії в умовному Києві можуть якось вирішити проблеми національної безпеки України.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Нам відомо про велику кількість нових небезпек для держкомпаній, але поки невідомо про жодну компанію, у якої виникла потреба фізично проводити засідання наглядової ради за адресою розташування.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Потенційна загроза від такого закону зрозуміла – це чудова основа для того, щоби "знести" всі надбання у важкій реформі держпідприємств після Революції Гідності, включаючи незалежні наглядові ради, а потім встановити ручне управління.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Таке, яке було до 2015 року.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Навіщо держкомпаніям наглядові ради і хто повинен до них входити?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Більше того – якщо під патріотичними гаслами "злетить" один шкідливий законопроєкт, то завтра можуть злетіти й інші – наприклад, можна знести систему державних закупівель через ProZorro або незалежність НБУ.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Багато що можна списати на війну.</seg>
          <seg id="10">До речі, ця ініціатива з’явилася ще до початку війни та законопроєкту 7176.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Так ще 22 лютого цю норму було внесено до порівняльної таблиці законопроєкту 5397.</seg>
          <seg id="12">А загалом бажання розігнати наглядові ради у той чи інший спосіб циркулює серед деяких народних обранців вже давно.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Не заради критики як такої, а для того, щоби показати можливі наслідки законопроєкту, розберемо аргументи, якими пояснювалася необхідність його прийняття.</seg>
          <seg id="14">А потім надамо свої пропозиції, як вирішити питання управління держпідприємствами під час війни.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Перший заступник міністра економіки Денис Кудін пояснював необхідність такої новації ризиками втрати інтернету та інших засобів зв’язку, що унеможливить віддалену роботу наглядових рад.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Іншими словами ризик полягає у тому, що наглядова рада не зможе приймати необхідні рішення, у зв’язку чим може бути паралізована робота компанії.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Погоджуємося, що такий ризик є, однак чи зможе йому запобігти переїзд членів наглядових рад до України?</seg>
          <seg id="18">Уявімо доволі цинічну ситуацію, коли незалежні члени наглядових рад (які становлять більшість від усього складу) поставлять свою особисту безпеку вище за інтереси компанії і відмовляться приїжджати до України.</seg>
          <seg id="19">У такому разі згідно законопроєкту їх можна буде звільнити.</seg>
          <seg id="20">А далі, швидше за все, це призведе до втрати кворуму, необхідного наглядовій раді для прийняття будь-яких рішень.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Натомість, швидко призначити нових незалежних членів наглядової ради не вийде, оскільки закон передбачає необхідність проведення конкурсного відбору, який в середньому триває 3-4 місяці.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Отже запропоноване законопроєктом 7176 рішення скоріше за все не зможе уберегти від втрати наглядовою радою можливості приймати рішення, а радше навпаки призведе до цього!</seg>
          <seg id="23">Народний депутат, автор законопроєкту Дмитро Наталуха надає інші аргументи на його підтримку.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Зокрема, він зазначає: "багато підприємств, зокрема оборонно-промислового комплексу (ОПК), зараз потребують релокації" і тому "важко уявити, що людина може, наприклад, із Відня по Zoom обговорювати адреси та іншу сенситивну інформацію".</seg>
          <seg id="25">Для початку, в Україні взагалі майже немає держпідприємств ОПК, які мають наглядові ради.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Наглядова рада є хіба в "Укроборонпромі", який по суті і здійснює управління майже всіма держпідприємствами ОПК.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Але навіть в "Укроборонпромі", відповідно до законодавства, наглядова рада має досить обмежені повноваження, а всі її члени виконують обов’язки не безоплатній основі.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Вся повнота влади в "Укроборонромі" належить генеральному директору, який до речі й прийматиме рішення щодо необхідності релокації того чи іншого підприємства ОПК, що входить до складу концерну.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Крім того, такий аргумент не витримує критики ще й тому, що законопроєкт 7176 взагалі не вносить жодних змін у законодавство, що регулює діяльність держпідприємств ОПК.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Пан Дмитро на своїй сторінці у Facebook також наводить аргументи, які можна віднести до категорії "емоційних".</seg>
          <seg id="31">Такі аргументи, як правило, не мають нічого спільного з підвищенням ефективності роботи держкомпаній та держбанків, але давайте спробуємо розібрати й деякі з них: "поважні експерти-іноземці при першому ж слові "війна", ще у 2021 році залишають Україну, але при цьому лишаються членами наглядових рад у державних підприємствах України з повним окладом у кілька сотень тисяч гривень, в той час як сама Україна реально потерпає від війни".</seg>
          <seg id="32">По-перше, це маніпуляція – більшість таких членів наглядових рад ніколи не проживали в Україні і лише періодично сюди приїздили.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Тому говорити, що вони "залишають Україну", м’яко кажучи, несправедливо.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Last week the Verkhovna Rada passed Bill 7176 “On Monitoring Potential Threats to National Security of Ukraine in the Economic Sphere.”</seg>
          <seg id="2">Surprisingly, the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere was… the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and banks hold meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The initiators of the bill think that decision-making by a supervisory board of a state-owned company in Kyiv, for example, can somehow solve national security problems of Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">We are aware of a large number of new hazards for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any companies that need to hold meetings of a supervisory board at the location address.</seg>
          <seg id="5">A potential threat caused by such a law is clear: it is an excellent basis for “elimination” of all the gains of a difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, followed by establishing manual control.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The control that was in place by 2015.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should constitute them?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Besides, if one harmful bill with patriotic slogans is implemented, others may appear tomorrow – for example, it is possible to eliminate the public procurement system through the ProZorro system or independence of the National Bank of Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="9">A lot of things may be attributed to the war.</seg>
          <seg id="10">By the way, this initiative emerged before the war and Bill 7176.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Thus, on February 22 this regulation was included in the comparative table of Bill 5397.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected representatives for a long time.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Let us analyze the arguments that were used to explain the need for adoption of this bill not for the sake of criticism alone, but in order to show its possible consequences.</seg>
          <seg id="14">After that let us provide our suggestions about solving the issue of state-owned enterprises management during the war.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Denys Kudin, the First Deputy Minister of Economy, explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other communication facilities, which will make remote functioning of supervisory boards impossible.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In other words, the risk is that a supervisory board will not be able to make necessary decisions, which could paralyze operations of a company.</seg>
          <seg id="17">We agree that such a risk exists, but will it be possible to eliminate it by moving supervisory boards to Ukraine?</seg>
          <seg id="18">Let us imagine rather a cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of them) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In this case they can be fired in accordance with the Bill.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Most likely, after that it will lead to the loss of quorum required for the supervisory board to make any decisions.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, because the law requires competitive selection that takes 3–4 months at the average.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Thus, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent losing the opportunity to make decisions by the supervisory board, but rather will lead to it!</seg>
          <seg id="23">Dmytro Natalukha, People’s Deputy and author of the Bill, provides other arguments in its favor.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Particular, he notes the following: “many companies, including the ones belonging to the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person from Vienna can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom.”</seg>
          <seg id="25">To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned MIC enterprises with supervisory boards.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The supervisory board is only in the State Concern “Ukroboronprom,” which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the MIC.</seg>
          <seg id="27">But even in the State Concern “Ukroboronprom,” in accordance with the law, the supervisory board has very limited authorities, and all its members perform their duties on a grant basis.</seg>
          <seg id="28">All the plenary authority in the “Ukroboronrom” belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions concerning the need to relocate certain MIC enterprises that constitute this concern.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Besides, such an argument is beneath criticism, because Bill 7176 does not amend the legislation governing the activities of MIC state-owned enterprises.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Mr. Natalukha on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be classified as “emotional” ones.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and banks, but let us try to analyze some of them: “after hearing the word “war” for the first time respectable foreign experts leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of supervisory boards of Ukrainian state-owned enterprises with full salaries of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war.”</seg>
          <seg id="32">Firstly, it is a manipulation – most of such members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only came here from time to time.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Thus, to put it mildly, it is unfair to say that they “leave Ukraine.”</seg>
          <seg id="34">Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have been holding online meetings for a long time.</seg>
          <seg id="35">This tool has been long used throughout the world in completely different areas: business, education, medicine etc.</seg>
          <seg id="36">We also should not forget that membership in a supervisory board is not a full-time job.</seg>
          <seg id="37">As a rule, such people have other jobs, and it is electronic means of communication that help them with this.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Thirdly, all these statements sound like claims exclusively against foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="39">I wonder why Mr. Natalukha does not make identical claims against Ukrainian members of supervisory boards?</seg>
          <seg id="40">As they do not stay at the addresses of their companies too.</seg>
          <seg id="41">By the way, it is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a legislative draft 7176, which is called "To monitor potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".</seg>
          <seg id="2">It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was... the place at which members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks meet.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Initiators of the draft law believe that decision-making by the Supervisory Board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve problems of national security of Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">We are aware of a large number of new hazards to state companies, but is not yet aware of any company in which there was a need to physically meet the supervisory board at the location.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The potential threat from such a law was understood – it is a wonderful basis to "climb" all the achievements in the heavy reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory councils, and then establish manual management.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Those that were before 2015.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Why state companies supervisory boards and who should be included in them?</seg>
          <seg id="8">Moreover, if under patriotic slogans "fly" one harmful draft law, then tomorrow others can fly – for example, it is possible to destroy the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of NBU.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Many can be written off for war.</seg>
          <seg id="10">By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.</seg>
          <seg id="11">So on February 22, this norm was introduced to the comparative table of the draft law 5397.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory councils in a different way circulates among some people's defenders for a long time.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Not for criticism as such, but in order to show possible consequences of the draft law, we will consider the arguments explained by the need for its adoption.</seg>
          <seg id="14">And then we will provide our proposals how to solve the issue of governance of state enterprises during the war.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Denis Kuden, First Deputy Minister of Economy, explained the need for such innovation to risks of Internet loss and other means of communication, which prevents remote work of supervisory boards.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In other words, the risk is that the Supervisory Board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company can be paralysed.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Do we agree that such a risk is, however, will he be able to prevent the movement of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?</seg>
          <seg id="18">Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which become most of the entire composition) will supply their personal security higher for the company's interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In this case, according to the law, they can be released.</seg>
          <seg id="20">And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of quorum, the necessary supervisory board to make any decisions.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Instead, the new independent members of the Supervisory Board will not be appointed quickly, since the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.</seg>
          <seg id="22">So proposed by the draft law 7176 decisions will probably not be able to preserve from the loss of the supervisory board the opportunity to make decisions, and more likely to lead to this!</seg>
          <seg id="23">People's deputy, the author of the draft law Dmitry Nataliukh provides other arguments for his support.</seg>
          <seg id="24">In particular, he notes: "Multi enterprises, in particular the defence and industrial complex (ODC), now need a roll" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom".</seg>
          <seg id="25">First, there are almost no state enterprises in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The Supervisory Board is except in "Ukroboronprom", which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the OPC.</seg>
          <seg id="27">But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.</seg>
          <seg id="28">All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the Director-General, who by the way will decide on the need for the placement of a enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the group.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In addition, this argument does not withstand the criticism because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state enterprises of the OPC at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".</seg>
          <seg id="31">Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state companies and state banks, but let us try to understand some of them: "Convincing foreign experts with the first word "war", still in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with full salary of several hundred thousand UAH, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."</seg>
          <seg id="32">First, this manipulation – most of these members of the Supervisory Boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically arrived here.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Therefore, it says that they "leave Ukraine" softly, unjustly.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long been resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="35">This tool is long common in world practice, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Do not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.</seg>
          <seg id="37">As a rule, such people have other employment, and just electronic means help them in this.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Interesting why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards that are Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="40">After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.</seg>
          <seg id="41">By the way, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from the supervisory councils, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.</seg>

          <seg id="4">Сбєрбанк є найбільшою фінансовою установою Росії, що знаходиться у власності уряду, а Альфа-Банк – найбільший приватним банком.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Санкції заморозять будь-які їхні активи, які стосуються фінансової системи США, і заборонить громадянам США вести з ними бізнес.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Крім того, Штати запровадять повну заборону нових інвестицій в РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="7">З цією метою президент США Джо Байден підпише новий указ, який включає заборону на нові інвестиції в Росію громадянами США незалежно від їхнього місцезнаходження.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Цей крок базується на ухваленому понад 600 транснаціональними компаніями рішенні про вихід з Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Вихід приватного сектору включає виробників, енергетичні компанії, великі роздрібні торговці, фінансові установи, а також інших постачальників послуг, таких як юридичні та консалтингові фірми", – йдеться у заяві Білого Дому.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Третім кроком нових санкцій від США стали обмеження проти великих російських державних підприємств критичної сфери.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Це заборонить громадянам США здійснювати операції з цими організаціями та заморозить будь-які їхні активи в юрисдикції Штатів.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Тепер до вас теж прийшли тяжкі часи.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Протягом останнього місяця я спілкувався з багатьма з вас.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ваше життя, яке і без того ніколи не було легким, перевернулося з ніг на голову, як і життя кожного українця.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Багато з вас тікає з Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="6">І багато з вас зізнавались, що відчувають провину і сором через дії вашої країни по відношенню до ваших сусідів.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Через те, чому піддають Україну від вашого імені.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Над деякими з вас, активістами, уже давно нависала загроза, і ви готувалися до вирішального удару.</seg>
          <seg id="9">На початку березня я написав Олександру Черкасову, своєму дуже давньому другу з "Меморіала".</seg>
          <seg id="10">Розповім трохи згодом, – як зазвичай, лаконічно відповів Саша. – Зараз після обшуку ходимо по руїнах.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Інші ж – діячі культури, художники, критики, письменники – вражені раптовим обвалом вашого крихкого світу.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Нікому з вас не подобається Путін і його режим злодіїв і фашистів, більшість з вас їх ненавидить.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Але давайте будемо відвертими: за винятком дуже небагатьох з вас – тих, хто працював у "Меморіалі", у "Новій газеті", на "Ехо Москви", у "Медузі", організації Навального та в низці інших місць, – чи багато з вас робили хоча б щось для спротиву цьому режиму?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Окрім хіба що участі в мітингах, коли вони ще відбувалися.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Читайте також колонку російської журналістки "Пізно ховатися, пізно мовчати"</seg>
          <seg id="16">А якщо й так, ви впевнені, що ваше відчуття сорому і провини – не просто абстракція?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Можливо, вони викликані вашою тривалою байдужістю до того, що відбувається навколо, вашою апатією і вашою пасивною співучастю, які тепер, напевне, великим тягарем лягли на вашу душу й серце?</seg>
          <seg id="18">Так було не завжди.</seg>
          <seg id="19">У 1990-ті був короткий період, коли ви до певної міри володіли свободою і демократією – безладною навіть кривавою, але справжньою.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Але 1991-ий рік виявився не кращим за 1917-ий.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Чому кожного разу, коли у вас нарешті трапляється революція, вас зрештою охоплює такий сильний страх перед смутою, що ви шукаєте спасіння за спиною царя, нехай його ім'я Сталін чи Путін?</seg>
          <seg id="22">Скільки б людей він не вбив, вам все одно здається, що біля нього безпечніше. Чому так?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Справді, були допущені помилки.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Замість того, щоб захопити й оприлюднити архіви КДБ, як це зробили німці зі штазі, ви відвели душу на пам'ятнику Дзержинському – і дозволили КДБ залягти на дно, оновитися, переформуватися і захопити владу над країною.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Коли вас поставили перед вибором між грабежем країни та поверненням комуністів, ви не стали боротися за можливість третього варіанту – і покірно змирилися з грабежем.</seg>
          <seg id="26">У 1998-му році ваша економіка впала, і це знаменувало кінець масових мітингів за велику соціальну справедливість чи проти війни у Чечні.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Головною турботою стало виживання.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Потім з'явився Путін. Молодий, підприємливий, агресивний, він обіцяв розправитися з терористами і підняти економіку.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Мало хто з вас на це купився, але ви все одно або за нього проголосували, або ж надали перевагу не голосувати зовсім.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Коли він почав знову зрівнювати Чечню із землею, більшість із вас заплющили на це очі.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Я добре пам'ятаю ті роки.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Я тоді саме працював у Чечні, допомагаючи постраждалим від путінської "антитерористичної операції", і своїми очима бачив руїни Грозного, Катар-Юрти, Ітум-Кали та інших міст.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Іноді на вихідних я повертався у Москву і весело тусувався з вами, друзі мої.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Ми пили, танцювали, і часом я намагався розповісти вам про жахи, свідком яких я був: про тортури мирних жителів, про вбитих дітей, про солдатів, які продавали тіла загиблих їхнім сім'ям.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Ви ж мені казали: "Бреде, нам вже набридла твоя Чечня". Я дуже добре пам'ятаю ці слова.</seg>
          <seg id="36">У відповідь я обурювався: "Друзі, це не моя Чечня, це ваша Чечня.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Це ваша країна, чорт забирай, а не моя.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Я тут просто дурний іноземець.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Це ваша влада бомбить одне з ваших міст, вбиває ваших співгромадян".</seg>
          <seg id="40">Але ні, це все було надто складно, надто болісно, і ви не хотіли нічого знати.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Потім настав економічний підйом середини нульових, зумовлений зростаючими цінами на нафту і готовністю Путіна дивитися крізь пальці на те, що частина викрадених грошей залишиться у кишенях середнього класу.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Багато з вас стали добре заробляти, дехто розбагатів, і навіть найбідніші з вас придбали нове житло і знайшли кращу роботу.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Ціни росли, та хіба то біда?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Москва святково сяяла і лисніла від шику.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Коли вбили декількох опозиціонерів – Юрія Щекочихіна, Анну Політковську, Олександра Литвиненка та інших, – багато хто з вас був шокований та висловлював жах щодо того, що відбувалося.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Однак далі справа не йшла.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Коли після двох термінів Путін передав пост президента Медвєдєву, а сам посів місце прем'єра, ви, як я бачу, ледве звернули на це увагу.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Коли після декількох місяців правління Медвєдєва Росія вторглася в Грузію, більшість із вас проігнорували це або змовчали.</seg>
          <seg id="49">Скількох із вас я зустрічав у наступні роки на гірських схилах Гудаурі, в передгір'ях Казбегі або в кафе і в турецьких лазнях Тбілісі, поки частина цієї країни була окупована вашою армією?</seg>
          <seg id="50">Маю визнати, що навряд чи і ми на Заході багато що робили, якщо взагалі робили що-небудь.</seg>
          <seg id="51">Трохи обурення, трохи санкцій; але яке значення мало те, що Росія кричуще порушує міжнародне право, коли така велика спокуса російської нафти, газу та внутрішнього ринку?</seg>
          <seg id="52">Жити в Росії було добре.</seg>
          <seg id="53">А після важких 1990-х це було найголовнішим.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Втім, наприкінці 2011-го ви, мої російські друзі, все-таки прокинулися.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Коли Путін знову помінявся місцями з Медвєдєвим і посів президентське крісло, як раніше, багато хто з вас вирішив, що це вже занадто, і ви масово вийшли на протести.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Ім'я Навального стало прозивним, ви не йшли з вулиць пів року, і режим зрештою з жахом відчув, що втрачає ґрунт під ногами.</seg>
          <seg id="57">Після того він завдав удар у відповідь.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Спочатку було організовано альтернативні акції, потім було прийнято більш репресивні закони, і тюрми наповнилися людьми.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Тисячі опинилися за ґратами.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Дехто отримав величезні терміни.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"А що ми могли зробити?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">Я чув це так часто і чую досі.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"Держава така сильна, а ми такі слабкі".</seg>
          <seg id="64">Що ж, гляньте на українців.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Подивіться на те, що вони зробили два роки тому.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Розгнівані проросійським президентом, який обдурив їхні європейські сподівання, вони один раз захопили Майдан – і вже ніколи не покидали його.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Вони цілком самостійно звели наметове містечко та приготувались до рішучої оборони.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Коли прийшла поліція і спробувала його зруйнувати, вони почали захищатися за допомогою палиць, арматури та коктейлів Молотова.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Врешті-решт поліція відкрила вогонь.</seg>
          <seg id="70">Але замість того, щоб тікати, протестувальники перейшли у напад.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Багато хто загинув, але вони перемогли.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Утікачем став Янукович, а українці повернули собі демократію, право самостійно обирати лідерів та виганяти їх, якщо вони погано роблять свою справу.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Майдан дуже не сподобався Путіну.</seg>
          <seg id="74">Це було поганим прикладом.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Тому, скориставшись загальним сум'яттям, він захопив Крим.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Дехто з вас був проти, однак користі з цього мало.</seg>
          <seg id="77">А скільки з вас були в захваті!</seg>
          <seg id="78">Наскільки мені відомо, 91% громадян Росії підтримали анексію.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Звідкись раптом народився новий міф, і чимало вас, хто зневажав Путіна та його шайку, раптом повернулися на 180 градусів і почали його обожнювати.</seg>
          <seg id="80">Мені важко знайти причину, оскільки одразу після цього ми припинили спілкуватися.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Решта тих, хто залишився моїми друзями, в основному мовчали.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"Нас не цікавить політика", – казали ви.</seg>
          <seg id="83">І ви нову ховалися в книжки, кіно, каталоги ІКЕА та парки, геть як нові після реставрації, яку розпочав мер Москви в 2012-му році, – з їхніми бінбегами, загальнодоступним вайфаєм та хіпстерськими кафе.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Направду, Донбас далеко, а Москва така гарна – і стає лише кращою.</seg>
          <seg id="85">Ви заледве звернули увагу на Сирію.</seg>
          <seg id="86">Там були терористи, правда ж?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ІДІЛ чи що там… Навіть московський редактор, який випустив мою книжку про Сирію, розкритикував її тоді в інтерв'ю, бо я буцімто нічогосінько не розумів у тому, що коїться у Сирії.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Ну, принаймні, я їздив туди і сам бачив, як на вулицях Хомса державні снайпери холоднокровно стріляють в однолітків моїх дітей.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Серед усіх громадян Росії там побували лише ваші солдати, які у 2015-му році почали бомбити тисячі мирних жителів, набуваючи досвід для наступної серйозної війни.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Безумовно, багатьом з вас відомі слова пастора Мартіна Німеллера:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"Спершу вони прийшли по соціалістів, але я промовчав – бо я не соціаліст.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Потім вони прийшли по членів профспілок, але я промовчав – бо я не член профспілок.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Потім вони прийшли по євреїв, але я промовчав – бо я не єврей.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Потім вони прийшли по мене, але вже не залишилось нікого, хто б міг щось сказати на мій захист".</seg>
          <seg id="95">Скільки з вас говорили про чеченців, сирійців або українців?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Дехто з вас це робив.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Але переважна більшість промовчала.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Дехто дійсно говорить зараз – як, наприклад, Дмитро Глуховський, Михайло Шишкін, Михайло Зигар, Максим Осипов та інші.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Більшість дозволяє собі говорити з-за кордону, дехто – із середини країни, як Марина Овсяннікова, ризикуючи потрапити в новий ГУЛАГ або скласти компанію Навальному.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Що стосується інших, то вам найкраще відомо, в якій країні ви живете.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Тому, я впевнений, ви розумієте: коли Путін розбереться з українцями – або, що здається дуже ймовірним, якщо в нього це не вийде, – він візьметься за вас.</seg>
          <seg id="102">За всіх вас, друзі мої: за тих, хто мужньо, але здебільшого наодинці виходив на протести і досі відбувся незначним терміном, але незабаром отримає серйозніший.</seg>
          <seg id="103">За тисяч з вас, хто підписував петиції, хто висловлював незгоду в соцмережах (хай навіть лишень чорним квадратом в Інстаграмі) або ж висловлювався у приватних розмовах із колегами на роботі.</seg>
          <seg id="104">Часи, коли 10 або навіть 25 років позбавлення волі давали просто за анекдот, залишилися не в такому далекому минулому – і тепер вони, з великою ймовірністю, чекають на вас у майбутньому.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Хто тоді висловиться за вас? Хто лишиться?</seg>
          <seg id="106">Приклад українців – навіть більше, ніж 2014-го, – лякає путінський режим: вони доводять, що з ним можна боротися.</seg>
          <seg id="107">І що розум, мотивація і хоробрість можуть його зупинити, якою б гнітючою не була на папері його перевага.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Зважаючи на все, мало хто в Росії це усвідомлює, як і те, що взагалі триває війна.</seg>
          <seg id="109">Але ви, друзі мої, добре знаєте, що зараз відбувається.</seg>
          <seg id="110">Ви читаєте зарубіжні новини в інтернеті, у вас є друзі або навіть родичі в Україні, з якими ви підтримуєте зв'язок.</seg>
          <seg id="111">І Путін знає, що ви знаєте.</seg>
          <seg id="112">Тому будьте напоготові.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Ви розумієте, до чого все йде.</seg>
          <seg id="114">Гарне життя в обмін на ваше мовчання добігло кінця.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Ваші вибори – це просто хохма, ваші закони, якщо не брати до уваги репресивних, вартують не більше, ніж папір, на якому вони написані, ваших останніх вільних ЗМІ більше немає, ваша економіка руйнується швидше, ніж я пишу, у вас більше немає кредитних карток, щоб купити квиток на літак за кордон, навіть якщо якісь рейси ще залишилися.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Тепер Путін не задовольниться вашою мовчанкою, він вимагатиме вашої згоди, вашої покірності.</seg>
          <seg id="117">І, якщо ви не дасте йому те, чого він хоче, ви можете спробувати або якось поїхати, або вас розчавлять.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Сумніваюся, що ви бачите ще якийсь варіант.</seg>
          <seg id="119">І все ж таки залишається ще один.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Який врешті-решт і обрушить цей режим.</seg>
          <seg id="121">І, можливо, в умовах, що склалися, від вас буде потрібно менше, ніж ви думаєте.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Поміркуйте над цим.</seg>
          <seg id="123">Іскра спалахне не від вас: через економічний колапс, що насувається на Росію, вона, найімовірніше, загориться в провінції, в малих містах.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Коли ціни злетять, а зарплати не виплачуватимуться, ті люди, які голосували за Путіна всі ці роки, бо хотіли хліба та миру, вийдуть на вулиці.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Путін знає це і боїться цих людей набагато більше, ніж він боїться інтелектуалів та середнього класу Москви та Санкт-Петербурга, тобто вас, друзі мої.</seg>
          <seg id="126">Але якщо кожне місто виходитиме на мітинги саме по собі, як це вже періодично відбувалося, йому не важко буде придушити їх поодинці.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Необхідна буде організація та координація. Натовп потрібно буде перетворити на масу.</seg>
          <seg id="128">У вас є цей чудовий магічний інструмент – інтернет, який режим може обмежити, але який ще працює і який можна буде налагодити майже за будь-яких обставин.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Організацію Навального було розгромлено, але можна створити інші, більш неформальні, більш децентралізовані.</seg>
          <seg id="130">Вас дуже багато, вас мільйони.</seg>
          <seg id="131">Московська поліція може впоратися з 30 тисячами людей на вулицях міста, можливо, з сотнею тисяч.</seg>
          <seg id="132">Якщо вийде понад 300 тисяч, вона буде приголомшена.</seg>
          <seg id="133">Доведеться використовувати армію, але чи ця армія боротиметься за Путіна, коли дійде до справи?</seg>
          <seg id="134">Після всього, до чого він змусив їх в Україні, всього, через що він змусив їх пройти?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Звісно, небезпека буде дуже велика.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Багато хто з вас відчуватиме зрозумілий страх; ті ж, хто має дітей, боятимуться за них.</seg>
          <seg id="137">І це природно, це нормально.</seg>
          <seg id="138">Я б на вашому місці теж боявся.</seg>
          <seg id="139">На прикладі Сирії, а тепер України, Путін хотів показати вам, що трапляється з тими, хто наважується нехтувати своїм господарем, хто наважується не лише вимагати свободи, але справді намагається її здобути.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Але навіть якщо ви нічого не зробите, життя безлічі людей все одно будуть втрачені даремно.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Ваш син закине жарт у чаті комп'ютерної гри – і буде заарештований; ваша дочка висловить обурення в інтернеті – і буде заарештована; ваш близький друг припуститься помилки – і помре в сирій камері під поліцейськими дубинками.</seg>
          <seg id="142">Ось що відбувається вже багато років – і далі лише посилюватиметься, набуваючи все більших і більших масштабів.</seg>
          <seg id="143">Тож вибору у вас немає. Якщо ви нічого не зробите, ви знаєте, чим це скінчиться.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Дійте холоднокровно, мисліть стратегічно та досягніть того, щоб це стало реальністю.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Very old friends, more recent ones, the ones I do not know personally, friends of the spirit and the mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Times are hard for you too right now.</seg>
          <seg id="3">I have been communicating with many of you, over the past month.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Like the lives of every single Ukrainian, yours, never simple, are being completely overturned.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you are fleeing Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have expressed to me feelings of guilt, of shame, over what your country is doing to your neighbor.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Over what is being done to Ukraine in your name.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you, the activists, have been under the hammer for a long time, and have been bracing for the final stroke.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In early March I wrote to Aleksandr Cherkasov, a very old friend from Memorial.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“I’ll tell you a bit later,” answered Sasha in his usual laconic tone. – “Right now after the search we are wandering through ruins”.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others amongst you, cultural figures, artists, critics, writers, are stunned by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let us be honest: except for very few of you – those working with Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Meduza, Navalny’s organization and a handful of others – how many of you ever did anything to resist that regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except for joining the demonstrations, when there were any.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Please also read the column of the Russian journalist “Too late to hide, too late to remain silent”</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstract?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Could they also be due to your own apathy, your long indifference to what was happening around you, and your passive complicity, which you must feel now in your bones and in your soul?</seg>
          <seg id="18">It wasn’t always like this.</seg>
          <seg id="19">For a while, back in the 1990s, you had a measure of freedom and democracy, messy, bloody even, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Yet 1991 turned out like 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why is it that every time you finally have your revolution, you end up so afraid of the time of troubles that you run straight back under the skirts of a Tsar, whether his name be Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many he kills, it seems safer to you, somehow. Why is that?</seg>
          <seg id="23">True, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of raiding the KGB archives and exposing them to the light of day, like the Germans did with the Stasi, you let yourselves be distracted by Dzherzinsky’s statue, and allowed the KGB to lie low, regroup, rebuild, and take over your country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were offered a choice between the looting of the country or the return of the Communists, you didn’t fight to impose a third choice, and acquiesced to the looting.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998 your economy collapsed, and that was pretty much the end of mass demonstrations for more social justice, or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Survival became the main concern.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then they brought in Putin. Young, bold, aggressive, promising destruction to the terrorists and an economic turnaround.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you either voted for him, or didn’t vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">And when he started levelling Chechnya for the second time, most of you closed your eyes and turned your back.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years very well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">I was working down in Chechnya, providing aid to the innumerable victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation,” travelling through the ruins of Groznyi and Katyr-Yurt and Itum-Kale and so many other towns.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes, I came back to Moscow for a break and I partied with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, we danced, and then I would try to tell you about the horrors I was seeing down there, the tortured civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers selling back the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">And you would say to me: “Brad, we’re fed up with your Chechnya.” I remember those words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">And I would rage at you: “Guys, it’s not my Chechnya, it’s your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Damn it, it’s your country, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I’m just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">It’s your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was too complicated, too painful, you didn’t want to know.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the great economic boom of the mid-2000s, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to allow some of the stolen money to cascade down to the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you made money, some of you lots of it, and even the poorer ones among you got new apartments and better jobs.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices rose but that was alright.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow was aglow, glittery, chic, fun.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When opponents were murdered – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaïa, Aleksandr Litvinenko, and others – you expressed horror and shock.</seg>
          <seg id="46">But it hardly went further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When Putin, after two terms, handed the presidency to his prime minister and took his seat, you barely noticed, as far as I could tell.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When Russia, a few months into Medvedev’s presidency, invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it, or stayed quiet.</seg>
          <seg id="49">And for years after, how many of you did I run into on the ski slopes of Gudauri, hiking around Kazbegi, or enjoying the cafés and steam baths of Tbilisi while your army occupied part of the country?</seg>
          <seg id="50">Not that we, here in the West, did much either, if anything.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A few complaints, a few sanctions; but what were egregious violations of international law in comparison to the lure of Russia’s oil, gas and internal market?</seg>
          <seg id="52">It was fine to live in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And it was the most important thing after the difficult 1990s.</seg>
          <seg id="54">At the end of 2011, though, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin switched seats with Medvedev again, putting himself right back into the president’s chair, many of you decided that was one dirty trick too many, and you came out en masse to protest.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny became a household name and for six months you filled the squares, finally putting fear into the regime, rocking it on its heels.</seg>
          <seg id="57">Then it struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First it organized counter-protests; then it passed more repressive laws, and started filling up its jails.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands were arrested.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some got very long sentences.</seg>
          <seg id="61">“What could we have done?”</seg>
          <seg id="62">I heard this so often, and still hear it now.</seg>
          <seg id="63">“The State is so strong, and we are so weak.”</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Once they occupied Maidan, in their rage at a pro-Russian president who had betrayed his promise of more Europe, they never left it.</seg>
          <seg id="67">hey formed a tent city, entirely self-organized, and willing to defend itself.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came to try and break it up, they fought back, with sticks and iron bars and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">At the end, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of running, the protesters charged.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many of them died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">It was Yanukovych who ran, and the Ukrainians got their democracy back, their right to choose their leaders and throw them out when they don’t do the job.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin really didn’t like Maidan.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">So he grabbed Crimea while everyone was still off-balance.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some few of you also protested that, but to no avail.</seg>
          <seg id="77">So many were enthused!</seg>
          <seg id="78">91% of Russians approved the annexation, I believe.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Suddenly there was a new myth, and some of you who had despised Putin and his clique suddenly turned around and worshipped him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">I don’t know why, as we quickly stopped talking after that.</seg>
          <seg id="81">As for the others, those of you who remained my friends, you mainly stayed silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">“I’m not interested in politics,” you would say.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you would go back to literature, or films, or IKEA catalogues, or enjoying the brand-new parks the mayor of Moscow had been seeding the city with since 2012, with their bean bags and free Wi-Fi and hipster cafés.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Yes, Donbass was far, and Moscow was cool, and getting cooler still.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You barely even noticed Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">Anyhow they were all terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">Daesh or whatever… Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria then criticized it in an interview, saying I understood nothing about what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I had been there, watching children the age of my own being shot in cold blood by regime snipers in the streets of Homs.</seg>
          <seg id="89">The only Russians that went there were your army, who, in 2015, started bombing thousands of civilians and practicing for their next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Many of you, I am sure, know the famous words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a trade unionist.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out – because I was not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me – and there was no one left to speak for me.”</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you spoke out for the Chechens, the Syrians, or the Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But far too many were silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some, it is true, are speaking out now, people like Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maksim Osipov, others too.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most speak from outside the country, a rare few from inside, like Marina Ovsyannikova, taking the risk of being sent to join Navalny in his Gulag.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for the rest of you, you understand what country you live in, better than most.</seg>
          <seg id="101">And so I’m sure you understand this: when Putin is done with the Ukrainians – but even more so if he is unable, as looks likely, to finish them off – he will come for you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">or all of you, my friends: for those who have courageously but mostly individually gone out to protest, and for now have gotten only light sentences, but soon will get much stiffer ones.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For the thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed your disapproval on social networks (maybe only with a black square on Instagram), or who have spoken out in private to your colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The days when one got 10 years of deprivation of liberty for a joke, or even 25, are not that far in the past, and now they are also in your future, most likely.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And who then will speak out for you? Who will be left?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The Ukrainians, now even more than in 2014, are setting a terrifying example for Putin’s regime: they are showing that he can be fought.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that if one is clever, and motivated, and courageous, he can even be stopped, no matter what his overwhelming superiority on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Of course, nearly no one in Russia is aware of this, apparently, or even that there is a war on.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know what is happening.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read the foreign news on the internet, you all have friends or even relatives in Ukraine whom you message.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows that you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be careful.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You know where this is heading.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The days of the good life in return for your silence are over now.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are a joke, your laws, except for the repressive ones, aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer even have credit cards to buy a plane ticket out, if there are flights left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin won’t just want your silence, he will want your acquiescence, your complicity.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And if you won’t give it him what it he wants, you can either try to leave, somehow, or be crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other choice.</seg>
          <seg id="119">Yet there is one.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which is finally to topple this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">It probably would take less than you think, in the current situation.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark won’t come from you: with the economic collapse that is about to hit Russia, it will most likely come from the provinces, from the lesser cities.</seg>
          <seg id="124">There, when prices soar and salaries are no longer paid, all those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out onto the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this, and he fears them far more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg – you, my dear friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city demonstrates on its own, as already has occasionally happened, it will not be difficult for him to move and suppress them.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Things will need to be organized and coordinated. The mob will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this magnificent and magic tool called the internet, which the regime can hinder, but which can be made to work regardless of almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny’s organization has been dismantled, but others can be formed, more informal ones, more decentralized.</seg>
          <seg id="130">You are very numerous, you are millions.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people in the street, maybe a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">More than 300 thousand, they would be overwhelmed.</seg>
          <seg id="133">They would have to call in the army, but would this army fight for Putin, when it came down to it?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After what he has made them do in Ukraine, what he has done to them?</seg>
          <seg id="135">There will be terrible danger, of course.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Some of you will be afraid, and those of you with children will be terrified of something happening to them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">This is natural and normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In your place, I would be afraid too.</seg>
          <seg id="139">In Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin sought to show you, by example, what happens to a people who dare to defy their master, who dare not only to ask for freedom but actually to try and take it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Yet if you do nothing, so many lives will be lost in vain.</seg>
          <seg id="141">One of your sons will make a joke on a video game chat, and will be arrested; one of your daughters will express her indignation on internet and will be arrested; a dear friend of yours will make a mistake and will die in a dank cell under the sticks of the police.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for years now, and is what will continue to happen, on a greater and greater scale.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Be smart, be strategic, and find a way to make it happen.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Friends are not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Now, too, hard times came to you.</seg>
          <seg id="3">During the last month I communicated with many of you.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Your life, which was never easy, turned from the feet to the head, as well as every Ukrainian life.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you run from Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have acknowledged that they feel guilty and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbours.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because of why Ukraine is subjected to your name.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you, activists, have long hanged the threat, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.</seg>
          <seg id="9">At the beginning of March, I wrote Alexander Cherkassy, my very ancient friend from the Memorial.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Let's tell a little later, – as usual, Sasha laconically replied. – Now, after searching, we go on ruins.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others – artists, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let us be frank: except for a few of you – those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medus, the Naval Organization and in a number of other places – did many of you do at least something to resist this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Besides participating in the rally when they were still taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Let's hide, late silence"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, you are sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive participation, which are now probably a great burden on your heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">So it wasn't always.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In the 1990s was a short period when you have to some extent freedom and democracy – even a curve, but a real one.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 was not the best in 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why every time you finally have a revolution, will you eventually cover such a strong fear of sadness that you are looking for salvation behind the back of the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">How many people he did not kill, you still seem to be safer at him. Why?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Indeed, mistakes were admitted.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of capturing the publication of the KDB archives, as the Germans have done with happiness, you have left the soul on the monument of Dzerzhinsky – and allowed the KDB to lay down, update, reform and capture power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were put before choosing between the robbery of the country and the return of communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option – and pokerly reconciled with the robbery.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy fell, and it marked the end of mass protests for great social justice or against it in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The main concern was survival.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. Young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Little of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he began to compare Chechnya again with the earth, most of you put on this eye.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember well those years.</seg>
          <seg id="32">I worked in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kal and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes in the weekend I returned to Moscow and fun with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of peaceful inhabitants, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You said to me, "Bred, we have already bored your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">I answered, "Friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">It's your country, horror takes away, not my.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a foolish foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">This is your power to bomb one of your cities, kills your co-citizens."</seg>
          <seg id="40">But not, it was too difficult, too painful, and you did not want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then there was an economic rise in the middle of zero, due to the growing oil prices and Putin's readiness to watch through his fingers that part of the stolen money will remain in middle-class pockets.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you began to earn good, some rich, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices rose, are you wrong?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shined and foxed from the chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several opponents – Yuriy Shchekochin, Anna Politkovska, Alexander Litvinenko and others – were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what happened.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, the case did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When after two deadlines Putin transferred the post to President Medvedev, and the premiere itself took place, you, as I see, almost drew this attention.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When after a few months of the Medvedev government Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or destroyed it.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you have met in the coming years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the suburbs of Kazbeg or in the cafe and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, until part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I should recognize that we were unlikely to do much in the West if they did anything at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A bit of frustration, a bit of sanctions; but what is the importance that Russia is crucially violating international law, when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?</seg>
          <seg id="52">Living in Russia was good.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the heavy 1990s it was the most important.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and sowed a presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was already too, and you were massively opposed.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The Name of Naval has become responsive, you did not go from the streets for a half year, and the regime eventually felt horror that losing the ground under the legs.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that he striked in response.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands were behind the game.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some got huge terms.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"What could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I heard it so often and I hear so far.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong, and we are also weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Awakened by the pro-Russian president, who praised their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan – and never left him.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They completely independently led the tent town and prepared for decisive defence.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend with fingers, reinforcements and cocktails of Molotov.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Finally, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of flying, protesters went into attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">The fleece became Yanukovych, and Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and to expel them if they badly do their business.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The maidan did not like Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, using the general summits, he captured Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against, but there was little benefit from this.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who denied Putin and his shake suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to love him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">I'm hard to find the reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mainly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were hidden in books, cinemas, ICEA catalogue and parks as new after the restoration started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 – with their benbegs, a public bath and a hipster cafe.</seg>
          <seg id="84">In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so good – and it becomes only better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You almost drew attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">Even the Moscow editor, who released my book about Syria, criticized it then in an interview, because I did not understand anything else in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least, I rided there and saw himself how the state snipers cold blood shoot in the streets of Homs in my children.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who began bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Of course, many of you know the words of pastor Martin Nemeller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"They first came to socialists, but I declared – because I am not socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came to the members of trade unions, but I declared – because I am not a member of trade unions.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came to Jews, but I declared – for I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came to me, but no one else could say to my defence."</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did it.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the majority declined.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some really speak now – such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maksym Osipov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most allows you to speak from abroad, some – from the middle of the country like Marina Ovsannekova, risking to enter a new GULAG or make a company Navalnoe.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you are best known in which country you live.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin understands the Ukrainians – or that seems to be very likely if he does not have it – he will take for you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone protested and still took place in a small term, but will soon get more serious.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Thousands of you who signed a petition who expressed disagreement in social networks (although even deprived of a black square in Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">Time when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty was given simply for anecdotes, remained not in such a far past – and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will then speak for you? Who will remain?</seg>
          <seg id="106">Examples of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – fall in love with Putin’s regime: they prove that they can fight with them.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that the mind, motivation and courage can stop it, whatever its advantage was wicked on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Due to everything, few in Russia this realizes, as well as what is generally going on war.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with which you maintain communication.</seg>

          <seg id="113">You understand what everything goes to.</seg>
          <seg id="114">Beautiful life in exchange for your silence has reached the end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your choice is just a hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account repressive ones, worth not more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media no longer, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket for aircraft abroad, even if some flights remain.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not satisfy your silence, he will require your consent, your pokerness.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And if you do not give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or disappoint you.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see another option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet it remains another.</seg>
          <seg id="120">How to finally break this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And perhaps in conditions that have emerged, you will need less than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark does not burn from you: due to the economic collapse imposed on Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices fly, and wages will not be paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace to go on the street.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to the meeting itself, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magical tool – the Internet that mode can limit, but how still works and how you can set up in almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">The Naval Organization was destroyed, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.</seg>
          <seg id="130">You're a lot, you're a million.</seg>
          <seg id="131">Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If more than 300 thousand goes, it will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">Will you have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to work?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After all, why did he force them in Ukraine, all because he forced them to pass?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very big.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel fearful; those who have children will be afraid of them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And it's natural, it's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would also be afraid of your place.</seg>
          <seg id="139">On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who prefer to neglect their owner, who prefers not only to demand freedom, but also really try to gain it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the life of many people will still be lost in vain.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will destroy the joke in the chat of the computer game – and will be arrested; your daughter will destroy the internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will assume mistakes – and will die in the raw chamber under the police duplicates.</seg>
          <seg id="142">That's what has happened for many years – and will only be further strengthened, acquiring more and more scales.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know what it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Children are cold, think strategically and achieve it to become a reality.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Friends are old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Now hard times have come to you too.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you are fleeing Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have admitted that they feel guilt and shame because of the actions of your country towards your neighbors.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because of why Ukraine is subjected on your behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.</seg>
          <seg id="10">I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, succinctly answered Sasha. - Now after the search we go through the ruins.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let's be frank: except for very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Medusa, Navalny's organization and a number of other places - did many of you do at least something to resist this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except that participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which are now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">That was not always the case.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In the 1990s there was a short period when you to some extent owned freedom and democracy - messy even bloody, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 was not the best year for 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why, whenever you finally have a revolution, do you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer near him. Why is it so?</seg>
          <seg id="23">In fact, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of capturing and publicizing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did from the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, refresh, reform and seize power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were faced with the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option - and humbly resigned to the robbery.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The main concern was survival.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he began to equalize Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">I then worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and with my own eyes saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This is your country, damn it, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens. "</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic rise of the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you began to make good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices were rising, but isn't it a problem?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shone and shone from the chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochykhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, the case did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When, after months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or fell silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much if we did anything at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A bit of resentment, a bit of sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when there was such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?</seg>
          <seg id="52">Living in Russia was good.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went to the protests.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The name of Navalny became callous, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that, he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands were behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some have received huge deadlines.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"What could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I've heard it so often and I still hear it.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once captured the Maidan - and never left it.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Eventually the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin did not like the Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">That was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit to it.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">From somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shayka suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were hiding new things in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which was started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbegs, public vaifay and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it becomes only better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You barely paid attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I went there and saw on the streets of Homs state snipers cold-blooded shoot at the peers of my children.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"At first they came for the socialists, but I was silent - because I am not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I was silent because I am not a member of the trade unions.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent - because I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense. "</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did that.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some really speak now - as, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The majority allows themselves to speak from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new gulag or make a company Navalny.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you know best which country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin will deal with the Ukrainians - or that it seems very likely that if he does not succeed - he will take up you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone went to the protests and still held a short time, but will soon get more serious.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, were not in such a distant past - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority is on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues at all.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be prepared.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand what everything is going on.</seg>
          <seg id="114">A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are just a hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights still remain.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or you'll be crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt that you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there is one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which in the end will bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not break out of you: because of the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to light up in the province, in small cities.</seg>

          <seg id="129">The organization of Navalny was defeated, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are many of you, millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If you get more than 300 thousand, it will be stunned.</seg>

          <seg id="134">After everything he forced them into Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel a clear fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And that's natural, that's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would be in your place too afraid.</seg>

          <seg id="11">Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduza, Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - did many of you do at least something to oppose this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the Russian journalist's column "It's late to hide, it's late to be silent"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, surely, have laid a heavy burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">It wasn't always like that.</seg>
          <seg id="19">There was a short period in the 1990s when you had a measure of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the czar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why so?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Indeed, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of capturing and making public the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took away the soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the looting.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Survival became the main concern.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he started razing Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me: "Brede, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This is your country, dammit, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeros, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to see through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you began to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices were rising, but is that a problem?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shone and glittered with chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, the matter did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I have to admit that we in the West hardly did much, if at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A little outrage, a little sanction; but what did it matter that Russia was flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?</seg>
          <seg id="52">It was good to live in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to protests en masse.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that, he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands ended up behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some received huge terms.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"And what could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I heard it so often and still do.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Enraged by the pro-Russian president who betrayed their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once - and never left it.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent city all by themselves and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Eventually, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin did not like the Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Out of nowhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">It's hard for me to find the reason because we stopped talking immediately after that.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new as possible after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You just turned your attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ISIS or something... Even the editor in Moscow, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I probably didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs government snipers shoot my children's peers in cold blood.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Surely many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"At first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for the union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a union member.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense."</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osypov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or keeping Navalny company.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you know best which country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I'm sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed - he will take care of you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went to the protests and so far met with a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed your disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so distant past - and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will speak for you then? Who will be left?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of the Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that intelligence, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">In spite of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be ready.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand what it's all about.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are just a hohma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go some way or get crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there remains one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And maybe under the current conditions, less will be needed from you than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse approaching Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be fixed under almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are many of you, millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, maybe a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If it turns out more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And it's natural, it's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would also be afraid if I were you.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a damp cell under police batons.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Keep your cool, think strategically and make it happen.</seg>

          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you had not left the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that, he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands were behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some have received huge deadlines.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"What could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I've heard it so often and I still hear it.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan and never left it again.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, reinforcement and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Eventually, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do their job badly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin didn't like Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">This was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from it.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">From somewhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">It's hard for me to find the reason because right after that we stopped talking.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We're not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely as new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binbegs, public Waifai and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">In truth, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it is only getting better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You barely paid attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists there, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I went there and I myself saw state snipers shooting at my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Surely many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"At first they came for socialists, but I remained silent – because I am not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for members of trade unions, but I remained silent – because I am not a member of trade unions.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent – because I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you have done so.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some people really speak now – such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for the others, you know best which country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he fails – he will take it up for you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely but mostly went out alone to protest and still served a short time, but will soon get more serious.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given simply for an anecdote are not in such a distant past – and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of Ukrainians – even more so than in 2014 – frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing on paper his superiority may be.</seg>
          <seg id="108">In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues in general.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">Therefore, be on the alert.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand what everything is going to.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are just hohma, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or you'll be crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there remains another one.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And, perhaps, in the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not flare up from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and is much more afraid of these people than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magical tool – the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized can be created.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If more than 300 thousand come out, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he forced them into in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And this is natural, this is normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would be afraid in your place too.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but are really trying to gain it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat – and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a damp cell under police dubs.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years – and will only continue to intensify, becoming larger and larger.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's going to end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Old and not so old friends, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Now hard times have come to you too.</seg>
          <seg id="3">I have been in contact with many of you over the past month.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Your life, which was never easy anyway, turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you are fleeing Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country's actions toward your neighbors.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the decisive blow.</seg>
          <seg id="9">At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".</seg>
          <seg id="10">I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", at "Novaya Gazeta", at "Echo of Moscow", at "Meduza", Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - how many of did you do at least something to oppose this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the Russian journalist's column "It's late to hide, it's late to be silent"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, surely, have laid a heavy burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">It wasn't always like that.</seg>
          <seg id="19">There was a short period in the 1990s when you had a measure of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the czar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why so?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Indeed, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of seizing and making public the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took away the soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the robbery.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Survival became the main concern.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he started razing Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me: "Brede, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This is your country, dammit, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeros, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to let some of the stolen money stay in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you began to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices were rising, but is that a problem?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shone and glittered with chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, the matter did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I have to admit that we in the West hardly did much, if at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A little outrage, a little sanction; but what did it matter that Russia was flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?</seg>
          <seg id="52">It was good to live in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to protests en masse.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands ended up behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some received huge terms.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"And what could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I heard it so often and still do.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong, but we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Enraged by the pro-Russian president who betrayed their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once - and never left it.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent city all by themselves and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Eventually, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin did not like the Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>

          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Out of nowhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">It's hard for me to find the reason because we stopped talking immediately after that.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of my remaining friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as if new after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.</seg>

          <seg id="108">In spite of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be ready.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand what it's all about.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are hochma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go some way or get crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there remains one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And perhaps, under the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse that is approaching Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be fixed under almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are many of you, millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, maybe a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If it turns out more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And it's natural, it's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would also be afraid if I were you.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, many lives will still be wasted.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a dank cell under police batons.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Keep your cool, think strategically and make it happen.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Friends are old and not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Now hard times have come to you too.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Over the past month, I've been in touch with many of you.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you run away from Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because of why Ukraine is being exposed on your behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from “Memorial”.</seg>
          <seg id="10">I will tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered laconically. - Now after the search we go through the ruins.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others — cultural figures, artists, critics, writers — are amazed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Neither of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you — those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduga, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places — have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except unless participation in meetings when they still occurred.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the column of the Russian journalist “It's too late to hide, too late to be silent”</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive compassion, which now, probably, have a great burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">This was not always the case.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In the 1990s, there was a short period when you, to a certain extent, possessed freedom and democracy — disorderly, even bloody, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 was not the best year in 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why every time you finally have a revolution, you end up being overwhelmed by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he kills, it still seems to you that it is safer near him. Why so?</seg>
          <seg id="23">In fact, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as did the Germans from the Stasi, you took your soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky — and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, renew, reshape and seize power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were confronted with the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option — and humbly accepted the robbery.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The main concern was survival.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he began to level Chechnya again with the ground, most of you turned a blind eye to it.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">At that time, I worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Qali and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, we danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the children killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me: “Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya.” I remember these words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This is your country, damn it, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">It is your power bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic rise of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you began to make good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices grew, but is it a trouble?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists — Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others — were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, it did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When after two terms Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of the prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When, after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if we did anything at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what significance did Russia blatantly violate international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?</seg>
          <seg id="52">It was good to live in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin again exchanged places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went to protests.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands were behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some have received huge deadlines.</seg>
          <seg id="61">“What could we do?”</seg>
          <seg id="62">I've heard it so often and I've heard it so far.</seg>
          <seg id="63">“The state is so strong, and we are so weak.”</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Angry by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan — and never left it.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They completely independently built a tent camp and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">In the end, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleing, the protesters went into attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became the fugitive, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do not do their job well.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin did not like the Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">That was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general dismay, he captured the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">From somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his band suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">I find it difficult to find the reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">“We are not interested in politics,” you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you new hid in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which began the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbegs, public wifi and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful — and it is only getting better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You barely paid attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least, I went there and myself saw how on the streets of Homs state snipers coldly shoot at the peers of my children.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Surely many of you know the words of pastor Martin Nimeller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">“At first they came to the Socialists, but I kept silent — because I am not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came to the union members, but I kept silent because I'm not a union member.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came to the Jews, but I kept silent, because I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say something in my defense.”</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did that.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some people really speak now — like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new GULAG or form a company for Navalny.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you know best what country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians — or, what seems very likely, if he does not succeed — he will take over you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but for the most part alone, went out to protest and still took place for a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for an anecdote, are not in such a distant past — and now they are very likely waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who then will speak out for you? Who will stay?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of Ukrainians — even more than in 2014 — frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues in general.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be on the alert.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand what everything is going to.</seg>
          <seg id="114">A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are just hochma, your laws, apart from the repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer present, your economy collapses faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad. even if some flights are still left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either go somehow or you will be crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt that you see another option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there is one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not break out from you: due to the economic collapse impending on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the province, in small towns.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>

          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.</seg>
          <seg id="130">You are very many, millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.</seg>

          <seg id="139">On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat — and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet — and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake — and die in a damp cell under police batons.</seg>

          <seg id="13">But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked for Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Medusa, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places – how many of you did anything to resist this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except perhaps for participating in rallies when they were still taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the column of the Russian journalist "it's too late to hide, too late to be silent"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now probably put a big burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">This wasn't always the case.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy-dirty, even bloody, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 was no better than 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the Tsar's back, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why is that?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Indeed, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your heart out on the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The main concern was survival.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and boost the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it or chose not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he started razing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar yurt, Itum Kala and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank and danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me:"Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: "friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This is your country, damn it, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic recovery of the mid-noughties, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices were rising, but is it really a problem?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow shone festively and glittered with chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists were killed – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others-many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, it didn't go any further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, as I see it, you barely paid attention to this.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or kept silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I must admit that it is unlikely that we in the West have done much, if at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?</seg>
          <seg id="52">Living in Russia was good.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you came out en masse to protest.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that, he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands ended up behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some got huge deadlines.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"What could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I've heard it so often and still hear it.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Angered by a pro – Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once seized the Maidan-and never left it again.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent city on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Eventually, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovich became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job poorly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin didn't like Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">That was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but it didn't do much good.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were thrilled!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">A new myth suddenly emerged from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">I find it difficult to find the reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks like New after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012-with their binbags, public Wi – Fi, and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Indeed, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it is only getting better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You barely noticed Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, weren't there?</seg>
          <seg id="87">Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I allegedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I went there and saw State snipers shooting coolly at my children's peers on the streets of Homs.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"At first they came for the socialists, but I didn't say anything – because I'm not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for union members, but I didn't say anything – because I'm not a union member.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, but I didn't say anything – because I'm not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you have.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some people are really talking now-like Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some-from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into the new gulag or keeping Navalny company.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you know best what country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, as it seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed – he will take on you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly in private, went out to protest and still got off for a short time, but soon will get a more serious one.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or expressed yourself in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given just for a joke are not so distant in the past – and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of Ukrainians-even more so than in 2014 – scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that intelligence, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Apparently, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on at all.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, are well aware of what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be on your guard.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand where this is going.</seg>
          <seg id="114">A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are just a joke, your laws, if you don't count the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either leave somehow, or you'll be crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there is still one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The Spark will not come from you: due to the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small towns.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magic tool – the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized ones can be created.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are a lot of you, millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And this is natural, this is normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">If I were you, I'd be afraid, too.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat – and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online – and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a damp cell under police batons.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years – and will only get worse, becoming more and more widespread.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.</seg>

          <seg id="61">"What could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I've heard it so often and I still do.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Angered by a pro-Russian president who fooled their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan - and never left.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They completely independently built a tent city and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">The police eventually opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job poorly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Maidan did not like Putin very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from it.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">A new myth suddenly came from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"We are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were hiding a new one in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new ones after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binbags, public wifai and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Indeed, the Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and only gets better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You barely paid attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview, because I allegedly did not understand what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I went there and saw myself how on the streets of Homs state snipers calmly shoot at the peers of my children.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent - because I am not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for union members, but I kept silent - because I'm not a union member.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent - because I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense. "</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Someone really speaks now - like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you know best which country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, as seems very likely, if he does not succeed, he will take on you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but for the most part alone, went to the protests and still took place in a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, remained not in such a distant past - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will speak for you? Who will stay?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that reason, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority may be on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war at all.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be alert.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You know where it's going.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your choices are just hokhma, your laws, aside from the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or get crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">Yet there remains one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which in the end will bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not flare up from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to light up in the province, in small towns.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to rallies by itself, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization has been crushed, but other, more informal, more decentralized structures can be created.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can deal with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And it's natural, it's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I'd be afraid if I were you, too.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will throw a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a damp cell under the police clubs.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years - and will only intensify, gaining more and more scale.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Act in cold blood, think strategically and make it a reality.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Friends old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Now you too have come to hard times.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you are fleeing Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame about your country's actions towards your neighbors.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.</seg>
          <seg id="10">I'll tell you later – as usual, succinctly answered Sasha. After the search, we walk through the ruins.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let's be frank: except for very few of you -- those who have worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduga, at Navalny's organization, and in a number of other places -- Have many of you done anything to resist this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except for the rallies, when they were still happening.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, perhaps, a great burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">It wasn't always that way.</seg>
          <seg id="19">There was a brief period in the 1990s when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent - messy even bloody but real .</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 was no better than 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of sorrow that you seek salvation behind the tsar, let his name be Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer around him. Why is that?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Indeed, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to lie down, to renew itself. To re-form and take over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly resigned yourself to the looting.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The main concern was survival.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for him, or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he started leveling Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, we danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me, "Brad, we're sick of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">It's your country, damn it, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic upswing of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you have earned well, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices have risen, but is that a problem?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists were killed – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, it did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When after two terms Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, as I see, you barely paid attention to it.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or were silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A bit of outrage, a bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market is so great?</seg>
          <seg id="52">Living in Russia was good.</seg>
          <seg id="53">After the 1990s, this was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you came out in droves to protest.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that, he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands are behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some people got huge deadlines.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"What could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I have heard it so often and I still hear it.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Enraged by a pro-Russian president who had deceived their European aspirations, they seized the Maidan once and never left it again.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent city entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Eventually, the police opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">The fugitive was Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and kick them out if they do their job badly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Maidan did not like Putin very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he seized the Crimea.</seg>

          <seg id="113">You know what it's all about.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are just hogwash , your laws , apart from the repressive ones , are worth no more than the paper they are written on , your last free media is no more , your economy is collapsing faster than I write . you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to leave somehow, or you will be crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there is still one.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that is looming in Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to the rallies by itself, as it has periodically happened, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magical tool, the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged in almost any circumstance.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are many, many millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If you get more than 300,000, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">It's natural, it's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would be scared if I were you too.</seg>
          <seg id="139">In the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but actually try to win it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet and be arrested; Your close friend will make a mistake and die in a damp cell under police batons.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years and will only continue to get worse and bigger.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Old and not so old friends, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Now hard times have come to you, too.</seg>
          <seg id="3">I have been in contact with many of you over the past month.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Your life, which was never easy anyway, turned upside down, as did the life of every Ukrainian.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Many of you are fleeing Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country's actions toward your neighbors.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the decisive blow.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial."</seg>
          <seg id="10">I will tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.</seg>
          <seg id="13">But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial," at "Novaya Gazeta," at "Echo of Moscow," at "Meduza," Navalny's organization and in a number of other places - how many of you did at least something to oppose this regime?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Except for participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Read also the Russian journalist's column "It's late to hide, it's late to be silent"</seg>
          <seg id="16">And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?</seg>
          <seg id="17">Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, surely, have laid a heavy burden on your soul and heart?</seg>
          <seg id="18">It wasn't always like that.</seg>
          <seg id="19">There was a short period in the 1990s when you had a measure of freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But 1991 was no better than 1917.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the czar, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?</seg>
          <seg id="22">No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. why so?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Indeed, mistakes were made.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Instead of seizing and making public the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took away the soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.</seg>
          <seg id="25">When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the robbery.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Survival became the main concern.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Then Putin appeared. young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for him or preferred not to vote at all.</seg>
          <seg id="30">When he started razing Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.</seg>
          <seg id="31">I remember those years well.</seg>
          <seg id="32">At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.</seg>
          <seg id="35">You told me: "Brede, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In response, I was indignant: "friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This is your country, dammit, not mine.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I'm just a stupid foreigner here.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Your government is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens. "</seg>
          <seg id="40">But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Then came the economic boom of the mid-zeros, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to let some of the stolen money stay in the pockets of the middle class.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Many of you began to earn well, some became rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Prices were rising, but is that a problem?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Moscow festively shone and glittered with chic.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.</seg>
          <seg id="46">However, the matter did not go further.</seg>
          <seg id="47">When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.</seg>
          <seg id="48">When Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="49">How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?</seg>
          <seg id="50">I have to admit that we in the West hardly did much, if at all.</seg>
          <seg id="51">A little outrage, a little sanction; but what did it matter that Russia was flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?</seg>
          <seg id="52">It was good to live in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="53">And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.</seg>
          <seg id="54">However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to protests en masse.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After that, he struck back.</seg>
          <seg id="58">First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Thousands ended up behind bars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Some received huge terms.</seg>
          <seg id="61">"and what could we do?"</seg>
          <seg id="62">I heard it so often and I still do.</seg>
          <seg id="63">"the state is so strong, and we are so weak."</seg>
          <seg id="64">Well, look at the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Look at what they did two years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Enraged by a pro-Russian president who betrayed their European hopes, they took over the Maidan once - and never left it.</seg>
          <seg id="67">They built a tent city on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.</seg>
          <seg id="68">When the police came and tried to break it down, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Police eventually opened fire.</seg>
          <seg id="70">But instead of fleeing, the protesters attacked.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Many died, but they won.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Putin did not like the Maidan very much.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It was a bad example.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized the Crimea.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.</seg>
          <seg id="77">And how many of you were delighted!</seg>
          <seg id="78">As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.</seg>
          <seg id="79">From somewhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.</seg>
          <seg id="80">It is difficult for me to find the reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.</seg>
          <seg id="81">The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.</seg>
          <seg id="82">"we are not interested in politics," you said.</seg>
          <seg id="83">And you were new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as if new after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbags, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.</seg>
          <seg id="84">In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it only gets better.</seg>
          <seg id="85">You just turned your attention to Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="86">There were terrorists, right?</seg>
          <seg id="87">ISIS or something... Even the editor in Moscow, who published my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I didn't seem to understand anything about what was happening in Syria.</seg>
          <seg id="88">Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs state snipers shoot my children's peers in cold blood.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Among all citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Surely many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:</seg>
          <seg id="91">"at first they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then they came for the trade union members, but I remained silent - because I am not a trade union member.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - because I am not a Jew.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense. "</seg>
          <seg id="95">How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="96">Some of you did.</seg>
          <seg id="97">But the vast majority remained silent.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Some are really speaking now - like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovskyi, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osypov and others.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or making company with Navalny.</seg>
          <seg id="100">As for others, you know best which country you live in.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed - he will take care of you.</seg>
          <seg id="102">For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went to the protests and so far met with a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.</seg>
          <seg id="103">For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed your disagreement on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke are not so far gone - and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="105">Who will speak for you then? who will be left?</seg>
          <seg id="106">The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.</seg>
          <seg id="107">And that intelligence, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Despite everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.</seg>
          <seg id="109">But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.</seg>
          <seg id="110">You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.</seg>
          <seg id="111">And Putin knows what you know.</seg>
          <seg id="112">So be ready.</seg>
          <seg id="113">You understand what it's all about.</seg>
          <seg id="114">The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.</seg>
          <seg id="115">Your elections are Hochma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.</seg>
          <seg id="117">And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go some way or get crushed.</seg>
          <seg id="118">I doubt you see any other option.</seg>
          <seg id="119">And yet there remains one more.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Which will eventually bring down this regime.</seg>
          <seg id="121">And perhaps, under the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="123">The spark will not ignite from you: due to the economic collapse that is approaching Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.</seg>
          <seg id="124">When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.</seg>
          <seg id="126">But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Organization and coordination will be necessary. the crowd will need to be turned into a mass.</seg>
          <seg id="128">You have this wonderful magical tool - the Internet, which the regime can limit, but which still works and can be fixed under almost any circumstances.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.</seg>
          <seg id="130">There are a lot of you, millions of you.</seg>
          <seg id="131">The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, maybe a hundred thousand.</seg>
          <seg id="132">If it turns out more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.</seg>
          <seg id="133">The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?</seg>
          <seg id="134">After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?</seg>
          <seg id="135">Of course, the danger will be very great.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.</seg>
          <seg id="137">And it's natural, it's normal.</seg>
          <seg id="138">I would also be afraid if I were you.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to get it.</seg>
          <seg id="140">But even if you do nothing, many people's lives will still be wasted.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Your son will make a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a dank cell under police batons.</seg>
          <seg id="142">This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify, acquiring larger and larger scales.</seg>
          <seg id="143">So you have no choice. if you do nothing, you know how it will end.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Keep your cool, think strategically, and make it happen.</seg>
