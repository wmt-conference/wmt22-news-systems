          <seg id="2">用空气来洗手，哈口气判断疾病，精确搜寻雾霾来源 昨天晚上，在浙江大学2016年学术年会开幕式上，一系列脑洞大开的学术成果获得表彰。</seg>
          <seg id="3">这些成果的主要研究者都是学生，研究覆盖了环境、机械、能源、医疗、生命科学、人文教育等各大领域，同学们从一个好奇的点子开始，创造出了许多具有应用价值的高端发明，其中一些项目已在国内国际获奖。</seg>
          <seg id="4">生物传感器：你的家庭体检医生</seg>
          <seg id="5">生物医学工程学院博士生张迪鸣团队现场展示了一个智能手机端的生物传感器，大小只有智能手机的一半。</seg>
          <seg id="6">“你只需要轻轻呼一口气，这套仪器就能从你呼出的气体成分中，初步检测身体健康状况 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="7">张迪鸣介绍说，这套传感器与智能手机相连，呼出气体后，健康报告就会显示在手机上。</seg>
          <seg id="8">市场上能够检测健康状况的智能手环，一般检测的是温度、脉搏等物理参数。</seg>
          <seg id="9">而这套生物传感器运用了石墨烯这种新型材料，它的目标物是化学元素，敏锐的“嗅觉”让它能更深度、准确地体现身体健康状况。</seg>
          <seg id="10">智能手术灯：医生的高能眼睛</seg>
          <seg id="11">除了智能手机，手术室里也用起了智能手术灯。</seg>
          <seg id="12">这项发明在今年第44届瑞士日内瓦国际发明展中获得银奖。</seg>
          <seg id="13">光电科学与工程学院硕士生朱林靖、申俊飞团队在传统手术灯的缺陷中开启了新思路，发明了智能LED手术无影灯。</seg>
          <seg id="14">“很多疾病早期检测、切除不到位，跟医生手术室用的灯有关 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="15">申俊飞说，比如癌症早期检查时，医生如果不能及时看清所有肿瘤组织，那么之后癌细胞还会扩散。</seg>
          <seg id="16">这种智能手术灯有四个灯盘，通过调节光谱，来增强不同组织在光照下的区别度。</seg>
          <seg id="17">在手术过程中，医生可以根据手术需要和个人习惯，随时调节光斑的大小、光亮程度、光谱、颜色均匀性以及无影率。</seg>
          <seg id="18">这种智能手术灯已经在浙江大学医学院附属邵逸夫医院、浙江大学医学院附属儿童医院等医院试用，得到较好的反馈。</seg>
          <seg id="19">去年十月，这项发明获得国家挑战杯一等奖。</seg>
          <seg id="20">用空气洗手：省水又酷炫</seg>
          <seg id="21">普通人洗手就是用水冲，顶多擦点肥皂，挤点洗手液，而李启章等同学则发明了一套“空气洗手装置 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="22">只要站上装置的洗手台，我们的体重就能将空气压缩而出。</seg>
          <seg id="23">“就像是一个打气筒。</seg>
          <seg id="24">压缩出的空气，在水龙头处形成流体，和水结合在一起。</seg>
          <seg id="25">这样，我们就能把手洗干净啦 ！ ”</seg>
          <seg id="26">显色反应和细菌残留实验证明：通过这种方法洗手的效果，和普通的洗手方法是一样的。</seg>
          <seg id="27">这个装置只需要依靠我们自身的重力作为驱动，既能保证洗净程度，又能节约90%的水，整个过程完全无能耗，节能环保。</seg>
          <seg id="28">去年，在第二届全球重大挑战峰会中，这项发明在诸多世界顶尖名校中脱颖而出，获得唯一的金奖。</seg>

          <seg id="2">Washing hands with air, diagnosing disease through breath, and accurately seeking for source of smog; last night, a series of creative academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The main researchers of these achievements are students, with research covering major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education; students created many high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Biosensor: your home physical examination doctor</seg>
          <seg id="5">The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone with the size of only a half of a smart phone.</seg>
          <seg id="6">“All you need to do is to breathe out, and this set of instrument can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the components of the air you breathe out.”</seg>
          <seg id="7">Zhang Diming introduced, this set of sensor is connected to the smart phone; after you breathe out, the health report will be shown on your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Smart bands on the market which can detect health conditions often measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This set of biological sensor uses the new material of graphene; its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell” enables it to reflect the health status of the body more in-depth and accurately.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Smart operation lamp: high-functioning eyes for doctors</seg>
          <seg id="11">In addition to smart phones, smart operation lamps are now being used in operating rooms.</seg>
          <seg id="12">This invention has won the silver prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two graduate students from School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, developed a new idea trying to solve the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the smart LED operation shadow-less lamp.</seg>
          <seg id="14">“Improper early detection of many diseases and inaccurate excision are related to operation lamps used by doctors.”</seg>
          <seg id="15">According to Shen Junfei, for example, in early inspection of cancer, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, the tumor cells will still spread.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This type of smart operation lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.</seg>
          <seg id="17">During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformness and shadow-less degree any time according to demands of operation and personal habits.</seg>
          <seg id="18">This type of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Shaw Hospital Afflicted to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and received favorable feedback.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup Competition.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Washing hands with air: save water in a cool way</seg>
          <seg id="21">Normally, people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap and sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of “equipment to wash hands with air”.</seg>
          <seg id="22">As long as we stand on the washbasin of the equipment, our weight can compress the air out.</seg>
          <seg id="23">“Just like an inflator.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The air compressed out can form a flow at the faucet and combine with water.</seg>
          <seg id="25">As such, we can wash our hands clean!”</seg>
          <seg id="26">Chromogenic reaction and germ residue experiment results prove that the effect of hand washing this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.</seg>
          <seg id="27">This equipment is only driven by our weight, which can not only guarantee we wash our hands clean, but also save 90% of water; the entire process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environment-friendly.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention emerged among all the top universities in the world and was awarded with the only gold award.</seg>

          <seg id="1">觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证</seg>
          <seg id="2">这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！</seg>
          <seg id="3">普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。</seg>
          <seg id="4">众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。</seg>
          <seg id="5">这个时候便是需要急救的时候。</seg>
          <seg id="6">如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！</seg>
          <seg id="7">所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！</seg>
          <seg id="8">当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。</seg>
          <seg id="9">“在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。</seg>
          <seg id="10">在美国全国是平均15%能救过来。</seg>
          <seg id="11">在拉斯维加斯的赌场酒店，百分之七八十能救过来，上海、北京低于1%。”</seg>
          <seg id="12">这是第一反应创始人陆乐说的。</seg>
          <seg id="13">如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸没有了，心跳没有了，你掐人中是没有任何作用的。</seg>
          <seg id="14">必须做人工呼吸、胸外按压才有可能把人救过来。</seg>
          <seg id="15">我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。</seg>
          <seg id="16">说不定还能挽救一个人的生命！</seg>
          <seg id="17">急救证可以在你们当地的红十字会培训中心报名，我是在珠海的红十字会培训中心报名的，学生还有优惠呢。</seg>
          <seg id="18">PS：最后一张图是记录自己25岁前要完成的目标的，把急救证加入目标清单也是几个月前的事情，但是确实是完成了呀！</seg>
          <seg id="19">接着要去考其他想考的证书了，打算去考个潜水证，之前在小红书看到还有个潜水急救证，考这个证好像还得有急救证才可以去考，所以其实急救证还是很有用的！</seg>

          <seg id="1">先说结论，我个人认为《四海》是一部全方位的烂片，从各种意义上来说都是。</seg>
          <seg id="2">但你要说这部电影是不是一个亮点也没有，那倒也不是至少配乐选的挺好。</seg>
          <seg id="3">烂片分很多种，让你能在电影院里酣然入睡的算一种，让你看完后义愤填膺的也算一种，《四海》对观众来说就像是峨眉山上的猴子，它能用无数种方式来点燃你的怒火。</seg>
          <seg id="4">在侮辱观众这点上，韩寒真的是天赋绝伦。</seg>
          <seg id="5">这部片子最让人感到痛苦的就是它仿佛是克系小说里的造物，难以名状，漏洞多的就像是小马哥身上的风衣。</seg>
          <seg id="6">甚至看完后你会怀疑这里面是否有导演暗含的隐喻，但当你仔细思考之后发现它其实就是一坨屎。</seg>
          <seg id="7">先简单的说下我很难理解的一些情节。</seg>
          <seg id="8">男主居住地应该是偏南方的某个小岛上，和他的奶奶相依为命。</seg>
          <seg id="9">她奶奶有个愿望是想看下雪，然后剧情就安排邻里中的一个大爷开着小面包车送她去东北看雪。</seg>
          <seg id="10">高龄老人坐着面包车从南方到东北看雪？？</seg>
          <seg id="11">他和他爹对此还非常放心。</seg>
          <seg id="12">然后这位老人就没下文了。</seg>
          <seg id="13">在废弃轮船上开酒店，女主他哥怎么拿到营业执照的？</seg>
          <seg id="14">岛上飞车党小混混为什么能轻轻松松就把一段山路做到封路？？</seg>
          <seg id="15">然后路中间送钢筋的卡车就停在路边，四周连卡车司机都找不到。</seg>
          <seg id="16">这道具感也太明显了吧。</seg>
          <seg id="17">一个征信不行的且有违法嫌疑的小混混飞车党为什么会成为一名辅警？</seg>
          <seg id="18">面对高利贷为啥不报警，电影里警察还特地问了是否有难处？</seg>
          <seg id="19">一个成年人懂得用智能手机，却不知道在旅馆如何用房卡开门，然后强行安排找不到旅馆老板，坐在房间门外睡一宿？</seg>
          <seg id="20">这种莫名其妙的情节充斥在整个影片里，由于情节过于离谱以至于我回忆它们时都会令我感到痛苦。</seg>
          <seg id="21">除了情节外，更糟糕的是电影的主旨，或者说这电影根本没有主旨，就是一个面目可憎的缝合怪。</seg>
          <seg id="22">影片开头你会以为他想拍个喜剧片，20多分钟后你猜它也许是个励志片，看一半时你觉得它可能是个想体现小镇青年生存不易的剧情片，看完后你就压根也不知道自己究竟看了个啥，随之而来的是对自己深深的怀疑，大过年的为什么要跑到电影院去欣赏大便。</seg>
          <seg id="23">对于大部分人来说其实也都非常熟悉各类电影的套路了，比如你要想拍摩托车手，那就励志＋喜剧然后告诉观众一个有天赋的菜鸟是如何一步步走向成功的。</seg>
          <seg id="24">如果你想拍爱情片，那你就老老实实讲喜欢骑摩托的小镇青年和服务员妹子之间的恩怨纠葛。</seg>
          <seg id="25">如果你想反映现实，那最起码你的情节不能出现和正常世界相悖的东西。</seg>
          <seg id="26">（比如尹正演的那个新摩托刚被烧了，然后还能唱歌的角色），就不能去开一些连肯尼迪看了都遭不住的脑洞。</seg>
          <seg id="27">至于女主明明不是弱智可在某些方面表现的就像个5岁小孩，我真不知道这是演技的原因还是导演的要求。</seg>
          <seg id="28">还有一点我也挺想不明白，韩寒作为一个赛车手为什么这么热衷于在他自己的电影里添加撞车情节？</seg>
          <seg id="29">这样的电影安排在春节档里，难道是为了给观众添堵吗？</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">I will say my conclusion first; I think Only Fools Rush In is utterly a terrible film in any sense.</seg>
          <seg id="2">But it is not without any highlight; at least the music is good.</seg>
          <seg id="3">There are many types of terrible films; some make you sleep soundly in the cinema, some make you angry after watching it; Only Fools Rush In is like monkeys on Mount Emei; it can ignite your anger in countless ways.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Han Han is super talented in insulting the audience.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The most painful part of the film is that it is hard to describe like a monster in Cthulhu novels, and has as many loopholes as the holes on the trench coat on Javier Mascherano.</seg>
          <seg id="6">After watching it, you may even wonder if there is metaphors the director planted in it; but you will find that it is only a piece of shit after close examination.</seg>
          <seg id="7">I’ll first briefly talk about some plots that are hard to understand.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The male leading role lives with his grandma on some island in the south.</seg>
          <seg id="9">His grandma has a wish, watching the snow, and the a old male neighbor drove a minibus to take her to watch the snow in the Northeast.</seg>
          <seg id="10">An elderly goes to watch the snow in the northeast from the south in a minibus? ?</seg>
          <seg id="11">He and his father were okay with it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">And then there is no follow-up on this old lady.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship; how does the brother of the female leading role get the license?</seg>
          <seg id="14">How do the racing bike gang on the island easily block a mountain road? ?</seg>
          <seg id="15">Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road just stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.</seg>
          <seg id="16">They are obviously props.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Why could a little gangster biker with poor credit and who was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?</seg>
          <seg id="18">Why didn’t he call the police when there was usury involved, and the police specifically asked if there was any problem.</seg>
          <seg id="19">An adult who knows how to use smart phone doesn’t know how to use the card to open the door at the hotel, and it was forcefully arranged for him not being able to find the owner of the hotel and so he slept outside the hotel for the night?</seg>
          <seg id="20">Such ridiculous plots were everywhere in the film; the plots are so ridiculous that I feel painful when I remember them.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In addition to the plots, the theme of the film is even more terrible, or you can say there is no theme in the film; it’s just a horrible monster that is stitched together.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy; after twenty minutes, you may guess it’s an inspiration film; after a half of it, you may think it’s a drama showcasing the hardship of a small town boy; after you watch all of it, you don’t even know what you have watched; what follows is deep doubt in yourself; why would you go to the cinema to watch a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?</seg>
          <seg id="23">Most people are familiar with the routines of various films; for example, if you want to make a film about a biker, then make it an inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.</seg>
          <seg id="24">If you want to make a love film, just tell the story about a small town boy who loves to ride motorcycle and a girl who works as a waitress.</seg>
          <seg id="25">If you want to reflect reality, then the plot should not have anything that is contradictory to the normal world.</seg>
          <seg id="26">(Such as the character played by Yin Zheng who sang after his new motorcycle was just burned ) please don’t think about ideas that are ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="27">As for why the female leading role acts like a five-year-old child when she is not retarded at all, I really don’t know if there is problem with her acting or it was demanded by the director.</seg>
          <seg id="28">And one more thing I don’t understand is why Han Han as a racer is so keen on adding the plot of car crash in his films?</seg>
          <seg id="29">Is such a film being arranged in the Spring Festival season to humiliate the audience?</seg>
        </p>

      <ref lang="en" translator="B">
        <p>
          <seg id="1">I’ll tell my conclusion first; Only Fools Rush In is a terrible film, in every sense.</seg>
          <seg id="2">But the film has one bright spot, i.e., the background music.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Terrible films can be divided into many types, including the films make you sleepy in the cinema and the films make you angry after seeing them; Only Fools Rush In is just like monkeys in Mount Emei, which can kindle your fury after you seeing the film.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Han Han is really a talent in insulting film viewers.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The most terrible thing of this film is that it is just like a creature of the Cthulhu school novels, which is nameless, filled with defects.</seg>
          <seg id="6">You may doubt if there is a metaphor implied by the director after you see it; however, you can find it totally a piece of shit after thinking over it.</seg>
          <seg id="7">I’ll introduce some plots that I cannot understand.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The leading actor lived together with his grandma in an island in south China.</seg>
          <seg id="9">His grandma had a wish of seeing snow, and an uncle of the neighbors drove her to see snow in northeast China with a minibus.</seg>
          <seg id="10">An elderly took a minibus to see snow from south China to northeast China? ?</seg>
          <seg id="11">And the leading actor and his father were at ease about it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Then the whole film tells nothing more about the grandma.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In addition, running a restaurant in a wasted ship, how did the female leading role’s elder brother acquire the business license?</seg>
          <seg id="14">How could a punk on the island close a section of mountain road so easily? ?</seg>
          <seg id="15">A car delivering reinforcing steel bars was parking at roadside, but there was no truck driver anywhere around.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The sense of prop is so obvious.</seg>
          <seg id="17">How did a punk with poor credit record and suspicion of violation of law become an auxiliary police officer?</seg>
          <seg id="18">Why didn‘t the person call the police when facing with the usurious loan, and the police specially asked if there was a trouble?</seg>
          <seg id="19">An adult who knew how to use smart phone but did not know how to open the door of the hotel with the room card, who was arranged as staying overnight by sitting out of the room because of failure in finding the boss of the hotel?</seg>
          <seg id="20">The film is full of such inexplicable plots; the plots are too ridiculous that I even feel painful when I recall them every time.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In addition to the plots, the purport of the film is even worse; or we can say there is no purport in the film at all, and it is just a monster of stitches.</seg>
          <seg id="22">You may feel that this is a comedy at the beginning of the film; however, 20 minutes later, you may guess it a motivational film; when seeing a half of the film, you may feel it a story film that reflects difficult life of young people living in a town; you don’t know what you see after you finish it, followed by deep self-doubt that why do you see a piece of shit in a cinema during the Spring Festival.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Most people are familiar with the routine of various types of films; for example, if you want to film something about a motorbike, the motivative film + comedy can be adopted, to tell film viewers the way for a talented green hand to go to success.</seg>
          <seg id="24">If you want to film something about love, you just tell the resentment between a young man passionate in driving motorcycle and a waitress.</seg>
          <seg id="25">If you want to reflect the reality, at least there should be nothing contradict with things in the normal world in your plots.</seg>
          <seg id="26">(Such as the character who sang songs after his new motorcycle was just burned played by Yin Zheng); please don’t kindling a headcanon.</seg>
          <seg id="27">I don’t know if it is about the acting skill or the requirements from the director that the female leading actress behaved like a child of 5 years ago since she did not suffer from mental retardation.</seg>
          <seg id="28">There is another point that I cannot understand: why is Han Han keen on adding some plots about traffic collision in his films since he is a racing driver?</seg>
          <seg id="29">Is such a film arranged during the Spring Festival, so as to make film viewers unhappy and angry?</seg>

          <seg id="2">南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。</seg>
          <seg id="3">据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。</seg>
          <seg id="4">该组织总监安本·皮莱（Unben Pillay）医生说，他每天都要看几十名病人，但是还没有任何病人需要住院。</seg>
          <seg id="5">皮莱说 ： “ 他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="6">他说，这包括老年患者和那些有健康问题的患者，这些人群本来更容易因冠状病毒感染而陷入重症。</seg>
          <seg id="7">他说，与之相比，在上一波的德尔塔疫情中，他治疗的新冠患者“呼吸困难，血氧水平低。</seg>
          <seg id="8">许多人几天内就要住院 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="9">在南部非洲首次报告奥密克戎变异毒株后的两周内，其他医生也分享了类似的经验。</seg>
          <seg id="10">虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。</seg>
          <seg id="11">据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。</seg>
          <seg id="12">非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="13">他还说 ： “ 现在还是早期，我们需要获得后期数据。</seg>
          <seg id="14">通常情况下，住院和死亡发生的时间较晚，而我们进入这一波疫情的时间只有两周 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="15">与此同时，世界各地的科学家正在观察病例数和住院率，同时测试目前的疫苗和治疗方法的效果。</seg>
          <seg id="16">尽管德尔塔仍然是全世界主要的新冠病毒株，但奥密克戎病例正在数十个国家出现，其中南非为疫情中心。</seg>
          <seg id="17">据卫生官员介绍，豪登省在12月的第一周发现的新病例增加了400 % ， 测试显示，奥密克戎变体的病例占90%以上。</seg>

          <seg id="2">Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that patients infected by Omicron are milder cases compared with those infected by Delta, although Omicron is more transmissible.</seg>
          <seg id="3">According to report from the Associated Press, as Omicron is being transmitted in South Africa, a report by a physician organization composed by more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa says that most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, such as body ache and cough, which are similar to symptoms of flu.</seg>
          <seg id="4">According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief supervisor of the organization, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Pillay said, “Their diseases can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after quarantine of 10 to 14 days.”</seg>
          <seg id="6">He said that those included aged patients and patients with health problems, who were easier to become severe cases due to infection of the COVID-19.</seg>
          <seg id="7">He said that, in comparison, the COVID-19 patients he treated in the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Many of them needed to be hospitalized within only a few days”.</seg>

          <seg id="10">Although it will take some more weeks to collect sufficient evidence, observation and early proof from doctors have provided some clues.</seg>
          <seg id="11">According to the summary made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the last few weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which accounts for a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay at hospital is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which used to be as high as 20% in the cases of the early epidemic phase in South Africa.</seg>
          <seg id="12">By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, Director of Africa Institute of Health said, “At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a relatively mild disease.”</seg>

          <seg id="14">In general situations, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s only two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic.”</seg>
          <seg id="15">At the same time, scientists from all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as testing the effect of the current vaccines and treatment method.</seg>

          <seg id="9">刑事惩罚的意义，从个别惩罚、社会预防到法律教育，可以列举很多“大词 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="10">但在拐卖案件告破之前，应优先关注被害人的人身安全。</seg>
          <seg id="11">事分轻重缓急，在急切的“寻救”目的之下，诸如“拐卖儿童是否应当一律死刑”之类众说纷纭、争议较大的话题，可以暂搁下来，谨慎讨论；但救助被拐儿童的事情等不得。</seg>
          <seg id="12">根据此类案件的侦办经验，人贩子惯于在得手之后尽快远离作案地点。</seg>
          <seg id="13">寻拐行动多耽搁一分钟，孩子就可能更远离家长一步，案件侦破的难度也就增加一分。</seg>
          <seg id="14">在此情况下，拿出如“团圆”平台这样直接有助于侦破案件、寻回孩子的有效办法，确实是务实的行动。</seg>
          <seg id="15">毕竟 ， “ 打拐”是需要运作起整个法制系统来做好的一件大任务。</seg>
          <seg id="16">打击犯罪、保障儿童和家长权益，从立法的完善，到司法的保障，以及执法的缜密，无不需要贯彻“护幼扶弱”的关怀。</seg>
          <seg id="17">此外，拐卖儿童的预防，从家庭到社会，都还可以做得更好。</seg>
          <seg id="18">比如一个常见的案例，一家三口在火车站休息，父母熟睡，醒来才发现孩子不见了。</seg>
          <seg id="19">不能期待一个两岁的孩子具有足够的自我保护技能，但作为年幼孩子的家长，应至少具有相当的保护意识。</seg>
          <seg id="20">父母两人轮流休息，又或将孩子置于稳妥的保护之下，都是预防儿童被拐的最起码手段。</seg>
          <seg id="21">从警方打击拐卖犯罪的另一面看，购买被拐儿童一方也应被关注和惩治。</seg>
          <seg id="22">单个的不法行为，往往只是长长链条中的一环。</seg>
          <seg id="23">根据我国《刑法》规定，拐卖儿童罪的法定刑起刑点为5年；情节特别严重的，可至死刑，并处没收财产。</seg>
          <seg id="24">起刑点高、最高刑重，在“轻刑化”的大趋势下，拐卖儿童罪显然属于处罚较重的罪。</seg>
          <seg id="25">可至今每年仍还有不少的拐卖案件发生。</seg>
          <seg id="26">可见，部分人在养育儿女方面的观念落后，法律意识淡薄。</seg>
          <seg id="27">对这部分人的法制教育应该同步跟进。</seg>
          <seg id="28">要有效控制拐卖犯罪，不能仅靠官方严格执法。</seg>
          <seg id="29">倘若收拐“市场”广泛存在，拐卖者利欲熏心，不断创新拐卖手段，形成与执法者的“斗法”局面，打拐行动势必会陷入低效的泥淖。</seg>
          <seg id="30">因此，破除落后观念，普及法律常识，也有助于根治拐卖、收买儿童犯罪。</seg>

          <seg id="1">Education news commentary: What should we do to rescue abducted children?</seg>
          <seg id="2">As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand of “buying abducted children”, if the masses can prevent and fight against abduction together and make abduction an action with no benefit, high risk and cost, then such crimes will not happen again.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Recently, the platform of emergency release of missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.</seg>
          <seg id="4">This is an Internet information platform established as an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and timely finding the abducted children.</seg>
          <seg id="5">I feel warm after hearing the App is named “reunion”.</seg>
          <seg id="6">This new technical means not only has an “artistic” name and full of warm feelings, but also makes appropriate use of informatization, making itself practical and effective.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The first and foremost objective of fighting against abduction is to find the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The judgment and punishment to the suspect is secondary.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In terms of the significance of criminal punishment, lots of “big words” can be listed from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, before solving an abduction case, the safety of the victims should be priority.</seg>
          <seg id="11">There are orders of priority; with the urgent goal of “rescue”, the discussion on contentious topics with divergent public opinions such as “if death penalty shall be applied to criminals of child abduction” can be shelved for now and be discussed with discretion; however, rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.</seg>
          <seg id="12">According to the experience in solving such cases, human trafficking traders tend to run away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Therefore, with each minute delayed in finding abducted children, the children are farther from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case also increases.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In this case, it is a practical action to present a platform such as “reunion” which can help solve the case and provide an effective method to find the children.</seg>
          <seg id="15">After all, cracking down on abduction is a major task that requires the coordination of the entire legal system.</seg>
          <seg id="16">To crack down on crimes and protect the interests of children and parents, the care of “protecting the young and helping the weak” shall be implemented in the improvement of legislation, and in safeguarding judicial system and meticulous enforcement.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from the perspectives of both family and society.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Take a common case as an example; parents and a child were taking a rest at the train station, and the parents found their child missing after waking up.</seg>
          <seg id="19">You cannot expect a 2-year-old child to protect himself/herself; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least some degree of protection awareness.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The father and the mother can take turns in taking rest, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the basic approaches for protecting children from being abducted.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Viewing from the other side of the crackdown on abduction, the party purchasing the abducted children shall be given attention to and punished, too.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Any single illegal behavior is usually one link of a long chain.</seg>
          <seg id="23">According to the Penal Code in our country, the criminal penalty starting point of child abduction and sale is 5 years; suspects with especially serious circumstance may be sentenced to death penalty with confiscation of property.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Under the trend of “light sentencing”, the crime of abducting and selling children has a high starting point and heavy maximum standard of sentencing, and thus it is clearly a crime with heavier sentence.</seg>
          <seg id="25">However, there are still lots of cases of abduction every year.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It is clear that some people are still lagging behind in the concept of raising children and have dim legal awareness.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Legal education should be provided to these people.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It requires not only strict enforcement from authorities to effectively control the crime of abduction and selling.</seg>
          <seg id="29">If the “market” of buying abducted children still exists, and abductors continuously create new ways to abduct children driven by the profits; this will lead to a situation where the criminals and law enforcers plot against each other, and the action to crack down on adduction will inevitably be low in efficiency.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Therefore, correcting outdated concepts and popularizing legal common sense are also conducive to eradicating the crime of abducting, trafficking and buying children.</seg>

          <seg id="7">In order to fight against abduction, the first objective is to find out the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The judgment and punishment to the criminal suspect is the secondary thing.</seg>

          <seg id="12">According to the experience in solving such cases, traders in human beings usually run away from the crime location as soon as possible.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Therefore, every more minute indicates more difficulty in seeking and rescuing of children and solving of the case.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In this condition, it is a practical action to establish a platform such as “reunion”, so as to provide an effective method to solve the case and find the children.</seg>
          <seg id="15">After all, “crackdown on the abduction” is a big task in need of the operation of the whole legal system.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The care of “protecting children” shall be implemented in improvement on legislation, judicial safeguard and careful enforcement for fighting against crime, protecting rights and benefits of children and parents.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from family to the society.</seg>
          <seg id="18">By taking a common case as an example, parents and the child had a rest in the train station, and the parents found their child lost after they woke up.</seg>
          <seg id="19">It is unpractical to expect that a child of 2 years old can protect himself/herself sufficiently; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least equivalent protection awareness.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The father and the mother can take turns in sleeping, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the elementary approaches for protecting children from being abducted.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Viewing from the other side of crackdown on abduction, the party that purchases the abducted children shall be noticed and punished, too.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Any single illegal behavior is generally one link of a long chain.</seg>
          <seg id="23">According to the Penal Code, in our country, the legal minimum standard for the crime of child abduction is 5 years; suspects with especially serious plots can be sentenced to death penalty, with properties confiscated.</seg>
          <seg id="24">With high minimum standard for the crime and heavy maximum standard, under the trend of the “lightening of punishment”, the crime of child abduction is a crime with relatively heavy sentence.</seg>
          <seg id="25">However, there have been lots of cases of child abduction so far.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas and weak legal consciousness in bringing up children.</seg>
          <seg id="27">It is necessary to provide them with legal education.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Strict enforcement of laws is insufficient for effective control of the crime of child abduction.</seg>
          <seg id="29">If the “market” of buying children widely exists, and abductors keep innovating abduction approaches, forming the pattern of “fighting against” law-executors, the crackdown on the abduction will inevitably be of low efficiency.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Therefore, removing outdated ideas and popularizing common legal knowledge contribute to taking a radical cure to child abduction and child buying.</seg>

          <seg id="1">国际橄榄油协会将橄榄油分为初榨橄榄油（Virgin Olive Oil）和精炼橄榄油（Lampante Olive Oil或Refined Olive Oil）两大类，五个级别。</seg>
          <seg id="2">初榨橄榄油或称为天然橄榄油，是直接从新鲜的橄榄果实中采取机械冷榨、经过过滤等处理除去异物后得到的油脂。</seg>
          <seg id="3">根据酸度的不同可分为三个级别：</seg>
          <seg id="4">特级初榨橄榄油（Extra Virgin）：是最高级别、质量最高的橄榄油，是纯天然产品。</seg>
          <seg id="5">口味绝佳，有淡雅怡人的植物芬芳，酸度不超过1%。</seg>
          <seg id="6">优质初榨橄榄油（Fine Virgin）：酸度稍高，但不超过2%，味道纯正、芳香。</seg>
          <seg id="7">普通初榨橄榄油（Ordinary Virgin）：口味与风味尚可，酸度不超过3.3%。</seg>
          <seg id="8">精炼橄榄油是指酸度超过3.3%的初榨橄榄油精炼后所得到的橄榄油，或成为“二次油”。</seg>
          <seg id="9">精炼橄榄油可分为两个级别：</seg>
          <seg id="10">普通橄榄油（Olive Oil）：精炼橄榄油与一定比例的初榨橄榄油混合，以调和味道与颜色，其酸度在1.5%以下，呈透明的淡金黄色。</seg>
          <seg id="11">精炼橄榄杂质油或橄榄果渣油（Refined Olive-Pomace Oil）：是通过溶解法从油渣中提取并经过精炼而得到的橄榄油。</seg>
          <seg id="12">看过等级分类的你应该已经发现，橄榄油的酸度是一个非常重要的指标。</seg>
          <seg id="13">要知道，橄榄果就好像酿制葡萄酒的葡萄一样，来自不同的产区、不同橄榄果品种的橄榄果，就会出产不同标准的橄榄油。</seg>
          <seg id="14">油橄榄的最佳生长地：</seg>
          <seg id="15">地中海沿岸具有油橄榄生长所需的最适宜的土壤和气温、日照、空气湿度以及降水量等气候条件。</seg>
          <seg id="16">除地中海沿岸外，其它地区只能在适生区零星种植。</seg>
          <seg id="17">主要产区产地（地中海）：</seg>
          <seg id="18">意大利、西班牙、希腊、土耳其、葡萄牙、摩洛哥、叙利亚、以色列、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、埃及、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩等等，与其气候类似的也有远在南纬度的阿根廷、秘鲁、南非等等。</seg>
          <seg id="19">油橄榄的采摘月份：</seg>
          <seg id="20">每年的3至6月，是油橄榄树开花坐果的时间，7至10月果实开始发育并且成熟，果实从绿色过渡到红色，紫色，最后变黑。</seg>
          <seg id="21">11月至次年2月是果实的采摘季节（橄榄油的新鲜度可是很重要的哦）。</seg>
          <seg id="22">橄榄油的营养成分：</seg>
          <seg id="23">橄榄油富含丰富的单不饱和脂肪酸，即油酸及亚油酸、亚麻酸，还有维生素A、维生素B、维生素D、维生素E、维生素K及抗氧化物等。</seg>
          <seg id="24">橄榄油被认为是迄今所发现的油脂中最适合人体营养的油。</seg>

          <seg id="1">The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, and five levels.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is oil obtained from fresh olive fruit after removing foreign matters by mechanical cold pressing and filtering.</seg>
          <seg id="3">There are three levels according to acidity:</seg>
          <seg id="4">Extra Virgin: is the highest level, best quality olive oil, a pure natural product.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It has premium taste, a slight and pleasant plant fragrance and a acidity of less than 1%.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Fine Virgin: has a slightly higher acidity of less than 2%, tastes pure and aromatic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ordinary Virgin: taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Refined Olive Oil refers to olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, also called as “secondary oil”.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Refined Olive Oil can be divided into two categories:</seg>
          <seg id="10">Olive Oil: is refined olive oil mixed with virgin olive oil in a certain proportion to adjust the taste and color, has an acidity of under 1.5% and a transparent light gold color.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil obtained and refined from pomace with dissolution method.</seg>
          <seg id="12">After reading the classification, you may find the acidity of olive oil is an important index.</seg>
          <seg id="13">You should know that olives are just like grapes that make wine, olives from different producing areas and different types of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The best growing area of olives:</seg>
          <seg id="15">The Mediterranean coastal area has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity, precipitation and other weather conditions for olive growth.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Aside from the Mediterranean costal area, olives can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas in other areas.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Main producing areas (the Mediterranean):</seg>
          <seg id="18">Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are far away in the southern latitude and have similar climate.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Picking time of olives:</seg>
          <seg id="20">March to June each year is the time for olive trees to blossom and bear fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, and the color of fruit will transition from green to red, purple and finally black.</seg>
          <seg id="21">November to February of next year is the picking time of fruit (the freshness of olive oil is very important).</seg>
          <seg id="22">Nutrients of olive oil:</seg>
          <seg id="23">Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Olive oil is deemed the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils found so far.</seg>

          <seg id="3">拜登在闭幕词中说，自由之火在世界每个人的心中燃烧，专制政权永远无法将其熄灭。</seg>
          <seg id="4">他也表示，计划明年召开第二届全球“民主峰会 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="5">台湾政府代表、政务委员唐凤和目前流亡英国的香港民主人权活动人士罗冠聪也在第二天的峰会上发言。</seg>

          <seg id="9">拜登还表示，捍卫民主需要整个社会的共同努力。</seg>
          <seg id="10">他说 ： “ 作为政府的领导人，我们有责任倾听我们的公民，加固民主的护栏，推动改革，实现透明的问责治理，更能抵御专制的缓冲和冲击的力量，以及那些想在公共利益之前赤裸裸地追求权力的人 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="11">“民主峰会”第二天的主题分别是捍卫人权，巩固民主与对抗威权，以及反击数字威权主义与肯定民主价值。</seg>
          <seg id="12">这一天恰逢“国际人权日 ” 。</seg>

          <seg id="18">他说 ： “ 长期以来，世界一直接受中国的崛起，却没有建立一个机制来对其进行问责。</seg>

          <seg id="21">罗冠聪也呼吁自由世界团结起来对抗中共的威胁。</seg>
          <seg id="22">他说 ： “ 也许你们中的一些人害怕惹恼习近平总书记，也许你们中的一些人不想失去中国市场，也许你们中的一些人没有认识到（中共）对我们民主价值观的威胁。</seg>

          <seg id="28">于疫情期间，各地的威权政府以公共卫生和集体利益为名，合理化侵犯人权的行为，全球民主呈现倒退的迹象。</seg>
          <seg id="29">然而在台湾，我们不必封城就能控制疫情，不必下架就能战胜假信息 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="30">就在“民主峰会”第二天日程进行的同时，美国财政部宣布对被认定严重侵犯人权的中国、朝鲜等几个国家的15名个人、10个实体依法实施制裁，同时对一家被认定利用监视技术协助侵犯人权的中国公司实施投资限制。</seg>

          <seg id="4">He also said that the second global “Summit for Democracy” was scheduled to be held next year.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Tang Feng, representative of Taiwan government and member of the administrative council, and Luo Guancong, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, made speeches at the summit on the second day.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Biden said, “We know that we are facing arduous tasks.</seg>
          <seg id="7">But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before and as what this Summit stands for, the world of democracy is everywhere.</seg>
          <seg id="8">A dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.”</seg>
          <seg id="9">Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were required to defend democracy.</seg>
          <seg id="10">He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, realize transparent accountability governance, so as to be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship as well as people who bluntly pursue power in front of public benefits.”</seg>
          <seg id="11">The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy” were strengthening human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy.</seg>
          <seg id="12">That day happened to be “International Human Rights Day”.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.</seg>
          <seg id="14">He said, “It’s the time to reiterate the common values, standpoint, as well as the tenacity of democracy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Social dialogue needs to be deepened to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This also requires us to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions.”</seg>
          <seg id="17">Luo Guancong, democracy and human rights activist from Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to continuously pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China including Uygur ethnic group and the Tibetans.</seg>
          <seg id="18">He said, “For a long time, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability.</seg>
          <seg id="19">This is the reason why there must be cooperation between politicians and civil society leaders.</seg>
          <seg id="20">We have to ensure that we will use all (the resources) we have to make the renaissance of democracy our primary task.”</seg>
          <seg id="21">Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite together and fight against the threats from the Communist Party of China.</seg>
          <seg id="22">He said, “Some of you may be afraid of offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.</seg>
          <seg id="23">And this is the reason why we failed.</seg>
          <seg id="24">This is also the reason why we must make changes.”</seg>
          <seg id="25">When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Tang Feng, member of the administrative council of Taiwan, issued Country Declaration with a video to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against dictatorship and authoritarianism.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He also shared experience on how to fight against COVID-19 epidemic with transparent information and the construction of mutual trust.</seg>
          <seg id="27">He said, “As democracy in Taiwan is still making progress, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.</seg>
          <seg id="28">During the epidemic, authoritarian governments from all over the world rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy.</seg>
          <seg id="29">However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without putting cities on lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it.”</seg>
          <seg id="30">On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy”, Treasury Department of United States announced it would implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries including China and North Korea which were identified as having severely infringed on human rights; at the same time, it would implement investment restriction on a Chinese company which was identified as assisting in infringing on human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.</seg>

          <seg id="1">其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。</seg>
          <seg id="2">身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。</seg>
          <seg id="3">裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。</seg>
          <seg id="4">过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。</seg>
          <seg id="5">如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。</seg>
          <seg id="6">其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。</seg>
          <seg id="7">穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。</seg>
          <seg id="8">如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。</seg>
          <seg id="9">越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。</seg>
          <seg id="10">以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。</seg>
          <seg id="11">对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。</seg>
          <seg id="12">微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。</seg>
          <seg id="13">当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。</seg>
          <seg id="14">胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。</seg>
          <seg id="15">短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔!</seg>
          <seg id="16">如果你是上身胖，但腿很瘦的MM，推荐选择华丽感的连衣短裙。</seg>
          <seg id="17">不但能遮住大肚皮，更能展现你的优点。</seg>
          <seg id="18">A字短裙会很显瘦，比较适合胖女孩，上衣要选择紧身一些的，形成层次感会更显瘦。</seg>
          <seg id="19">简简单单白T恤搭配短裙，胖MM也可以尝试。</seg>
          <seg id="20">微胖的女孩也是能够穿出时尚感的。</seg>
          <seg id="21">只要能够掌握好穿衣搭配的法则那么微胖的女孩子们也会是万众瞩目的焦点。</seg>
          <seg id="22">在穿衣搭配方面上有了改变后，在生活中也要多运动，争取早一天脱离微胖女生的标签吧😄</seg>

          <seg id="1">Actually, there are many tricks for slightly overweight girls to match their clothes.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Slightly overweight girls shall wear skirts not too long or too short; they shall be of the length at around the knees, just covering the fat part of the thighs.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The fat thighs will be shown if the skirt is too short.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Skirts that are too long will make you look short and fat.</seg>
          <seg id="5">If you are dressed in three sections, upper, middle and lower, you will naturally look taller; that is, use different colors for upper body, skirt and stockings, and you will look taller and slimmer.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In fact, a lot of darker color clothes are what slightly overweight girls all have, which the author deeply agrees; dark colors are good methods to cover fatness of your bodies; in addition, noble and elegant black short shirts are best choices for slightly overweight girls.</seg>
          <seg id="7">You will look slimmer in dark clothes, especially black short skirts.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Wear stockings and low-key shoes if your calves are fat.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The more common the better; the color shouldn’t be too bright.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In case people will notice your legs and feet and think you’re fat.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Slightly overweight girls shall master the tricks for clothing matching.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Slightly overweight girls shall never wear close-fitting short skirts and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or tucked inside the skirt, which seem strange; slightly overweight girls with thicker legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a flare skirt with print pattern and soft texture, and a loose-collar upper outer garment to cover the defects of the body.</seg>

          <seg id="7">You seem slimmer with dark clothes, especially black short skirts.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Wear stockings and shoes under the notice if your calves are fat.</seg>

          <seg id="10">So that people will not fee you fat when they notice your legs and feet.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Slightly fat girls shall master skills for clothing matching.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Slightly fat girls shall never wear close-fitting short shirts, and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or inserted into the skirts, which seem strange; slightly fat girls with fat legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a printed flare skirt with soft texture, a heaving-collar upper outer garment, to cover the defects of slightly fat girls.</seg>

          <seg id="9">The picture was discussed heatedly after it was spread in the Internet.</seg>
          <seg id="10">According to some people in the Internet, this behavior is “begging behavior grabbing attention”, but some others show sympathy to her.</seg>
          <seg id="11">“We found her at about 10:00 am on the 23rd day of this month when we went on the patrol around the square, and there were lots of onlookers then. ”</seg>
          <seg id="12">According to what the police of the Tianshui Police Station nearby told the local media, there were two young and beautiful girls of their 20s who set up a stall.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In which the girl acting as the “real person target” was keeping crying, and she begged onlookers to pay this game; the other girl was saying that the elder sister of her friend suffered from leucocythemia, in urgent need of operation fee, and she asked onlookers to help her friend.</seg>
          <seg id="14">“We have contacted the police in Guizhou and understand that the girl was raising donations for her elder sister who suffered from leucocythemia. ”</seg>
          <seg id="15">Yesterday night, the publicity director of Xiacheng sub-office of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the journalist of the Beijing News that this girl was Ji Jiali, and she was raising donations for Ji Jiayan, her elder sister.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Since more than 300 thousand yuan was required for treatment, Ji Jiali had no other good idea, and she did so.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He told the journalist that one of the two girls acted as the real person target, and the other girl acted as an assistant; no body shot arrows during the whole process, and some onlookers took pictures and sent them to MicroBlog.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Based on authentication by the public security department, the arch and the arrows are not within the governing category.</seg>
          <seg id="19">According to the publicity director, “this method for raising donations by grabbing attention is not advocated”.</seg>
          <seg id="20">She left from the police station after being warned by the police.</seg>

          <seg id="1">2021年什么最火？</seg>
          <seg id="2">无疑是东京奥运会。</seg>
          <seg id="3">您以为只有奥运健儿才能拿奖吗？</seg>
          <seg id="4">前段时间有篇《快看！项目经理可冲击金牌的奥运项目》文章很火，里面提到项目经理们在很多项目上，绝对是可以一马当先，无人能匹： 搬砖、出差、熬夜是项目经理的日常，救火、背锅、道歉更是不在话下。</seg>
          <seg id="5">看似玩笑调侃的一篇文章，却也道出了项目经理们的日常辛酸，背后代表的是对当前项目管理工作的力不从心。</seg>
          <seg id="6">而从事项目管理工作的人员，也渐渐选择通过一些行动来让自己摆脱工作中的困境。</seg>
          <seg id="7">从每年攀升的PMP（国际认证的项目管理专业人士资格）报名人数来看，越来越多的项目管理从业人员通过学习来提升自己的项目管理能力。</seg>
          <seg id="8">据《中国项目管理二十年发展报告(1999-2019)》称：截止到2019年9月，全国累计PMP®报考人数近60万人次，通过PMP®认证人数约42万人，有效持证人数约30万人, 占全球PMP®持证总量的31.2%。</seg>
          <seg id="9">近10年PMP持证人数逐年递增，这说明越来越多的项目管理者意识到：靠简单照搬以往“老经验”来做事已不可取，瞬息万变的工作环境让我们知道一个要学会，站在科学巨人的肩膀上去探索前行的道路。</seg>
          <seg id="10">然而，考了PMP就能保证项目管理工作畅通无阻了吗？</seg>
          <seg id="11">很多项目管理初学者表示，通过学习PMP/IPMP等相关课程，可以系统性地掌握项目管理的十大领域和五大过程组等相关知识点，但真正进行项目管理工作的时候却还是一头雾水。</seg>
          <seg id="12">很多项目经理常常反馈以下问题： 项目管理认知不到位，单纯依靠个人经验，空有项目管理理论，不知如何实践； 缺乏系统的项目管理流程制度支撑，工作中无法落地，项目预估不准，把控度灵敏度差，项目一拖再拖； 成员分工不明确、团队中的“老油条”不知如何应对 跨部门协助沟通不顺畅，项目难以推进 ……</seg>
          <seg id="13">因此，专注产品创新与研发管理领域十余载，已帮助众多优秀的企业培养了大批的产品经理、项目经理等研发关键人才，并获得了 “中国企业研发管理人才培训示范基地”等荣誉称号的中天华夏咨询带着《研发项目经理特训营》线上课程来了。</seg>

          <seg id="1">What is the hottest thing in 2021?</seg>
          <seg id="2">It was none other than the Tokyo Olympics.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?</seg>
          <seg id="4">Recently, there is an article titled Look! An article titled Olympic Disciplines in Which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals was viral, and it mentioned that project managers can be the foremost and unmatched in many disciplines, such as working arduously, going on business trips, and staying up late, the everyday work of project manager, and handling emergency, taking the blame and apologizing are nothing difficult at all.</seg>
          <seg id="5">A seemingly joking article also tells the bitterness of their daily work, and the hidden message is their insufficient energy to handle the current project management work.</seg>
          <seg id="6">People engaged in project management also gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in work by taking certain actions.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants each year, increasing project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.</seg>
          <seg id="8">According to the 20-year Development Report on China’s Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national PMP ® applicants totals 600,000, with 420,000 passed the PMP ® certification, and the number of valid certificate holders are about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of certificates of PMP ® in the world.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In the past ten years, the number of people holding PMP certificates keeps increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers realize it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying “past experience”; the rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, can you ensure the smooth proceeding of project management work after passing the PMP test?</seg>
          <seg id="11">Many beginners of project management say that by learning courses of PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points such as the ten fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they are actually engaged in project management work.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Many project managers often reflect the following problems: project management awareness is not sufficient, relying solely on personal experience, and there is only project management theories and no ideas about how to practice them; lack of support of systematic project management process and system, unable to actually implement the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project being delayed again and again; the members’ division of labor is not clear, there’s no way to handle the “sophisticated ones” in the team, communication is not smooth between departments, and it is difficult to push the project forward...</seg>
          <seg id="13">Therefore, ZTCHINA, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&amp;D of management for more than ten years and helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&amp;D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of “China Enterprise R&amp;D and Management Talents Training Demonstration Base”, presents the online course R&amp;D Project Manager Special Training Camp.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The online course R&amp;D Project Manager Special Training Camp is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advancing journey of project management on your own.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises with less cost and investment.</seg>
          <seg id="16">That’s all my own introduction, and you may see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content in simple terms by the ZTCHINA expert team (former Huawei R&amp;D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.</seg>
          <seg id="17">It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods as well as rich template forms to help students transform and apply the content into specific work after class.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Do you think only Olympic players can win a prize?</seg>
          <seg id="4">An article named Look! Project Managers Can Go for the Olympic Champion was really popular some time ago; project managers can take the lead in many projects: moving bricks, business trip and staying up are ordinary things for project managers, not to mention fire-fighting, holding the bag and apologizing.</seg>
          <seg id="5">An article seemingly playful tells the bitterness of project managers, telling the ability not equal to his ambition to the current project management work.</seg>
          <seg id="6">People who work on project management select to get themselves from difficulties in work by selecting some actions.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to increasingly grown number of application for PMP (international certified qualification for project management professionals), more and more project management personnel improve their project management ability through learning.</seg>
          <seg id="8">According to Development Report of Project Management of 20 Years in China (1999-2019), up until September, 2019, the accumulated PMP® registration number of the whole country is nearly 600 thousand person-times, and about 420 thousand of them passed the PMP® authentication, and the number of certificate holders is 300 thousand, standing for 31.2% of the total amount of PMP® certificate holders all over the whole world.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The number of PMP certificate holders during the latest 10 years has been increasingly grown year after year, indicating that more and more project managers have realized that it is not sufficient to work according to “past experience”; the working environment changing quickly makes us realize that it is necessary for us to explore the road by standing on the shoulders of giants of science.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, does PMP can make us do well in project management works?</seg>
          <seg id="11">According to many beginners of project management, the learning of the PMP/IPMP related courses can help them systematically master knowledge points such as ten fields and five process groups; however, they are confused when they are facing with real project management works.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Many project managers often reflect the following problems: improper project management identification, depending on too much about personal experience or project management theories, knowing nothing about practice; lack of systematic project management process system, which cannot be implemented during work, failure in accurate estimation on projects, poor control sensitivity, repeated delay of projects; undefined labor division, knowing nothing about coping with the “old stick” in teams, unsmooth communication among different departments, difficulty in promoting projects......</seg>
          <seg id="13">Therefore, Zhongtian China Consulting Company, a company engaged in the field of product innovation and research and development management, that has cultivated large numbers of key research and development talents such as product managers for many excellent enterprises, that acquired honorary titles such as “China Enterprise Research and Development Management Talent Training and Demonstration Bases”, presented its online course of A Special Training Camp for Research and Development Project Managers.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The online course of A Special Training Camp for Research and Development Project Managers is a online debris-oriented learning method, in combination of practical cases, tools and methods of multiple research and development enterprises, it helps you master necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, to walk to advanced path for project management.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This is also an opportunity to make enterprises promote the process of training for project managers with lower cost and less investment, so as to bring in efficient operation results for enterprises.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Let’s see what other students say about the course: This course is researched by the expert team of Zhongtian China (the original research and development management team of Huawei) in combination of international advanced project management methodology and true business scenarios of multiple famous enterprises, to give professional explanation easy to understand to the course contents.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In addition, it provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as abundant template forms, to help students apply the learned contents to specific work.</seg>

          <seg id="2">所谓大学精神，是指一所大学在发展过程中长期积淀形成的一系列办学理念和价值追求，是大学的灵魂所在。</seg>
          <seg id="3">从古至今，大学精神对于政治、经济、文化、科技、社会的发展，乃至一个民族的进步均至关重要。</seg>
          <seg id="4">从世界第一所现代意义上的大学诞生起，大学就肩负起不同于其他社会组织的独特使命，对于我国大学来说，兴起于民族危难之秋，其精神更是深受传统文化和时代变迁的影响，倡导“明德济世，修齐治平”的价值理念和“兴学强国”的爱国主义担当。</seg>
          <seg id="5">当前，高等教育信息化、国际化趋势日益明显，全球范围的教育竞争、科技竞争、人才竞争不断加剧，高等教育事业作为重要的“供给侧 ” ， 其结构性改革正面临前所未有的机遇和挑战。</seg>
          <seg id="6">尤其是《统筹推进世界一流大学和一流学科建设总体方案》的提出，在展示了我国从高等教育大国向高等教育强国迈进的信心和决心的同时，更是对大学发展提出了更高更新的要求。</seg>
          <seg id="7">如何在较短时间内努力跻身世界一流行列，在仍有一定差距的基础上加快建成若干所世界一流大学和一批世界一流学科，实现“弯道超车 ” ？</seg>
          <seg id="8">除了坚定目标自信、路径自信、能力自信，高校还应当充分发挥三种优势：一是后发优势，通过持续引进海外杰出学术人才，学习借鉴世界一流大学的先进经验，实现学术水平和办学质量的显著提升；二是文化优势，继承中华文明在五千年积淀的智慧内涵，弘扬发展优秀传统文化，以此来凝聚力量、塑造品牌、提升形象；三是制度优势，发挥社会主义国家的制度优越性，强化目标驱动，汇集共识合力，优化资源配置，为学校加速赶超世界先进水平提供可持续的坚实保障。</seg>
          <seg id="9">特别要意识到，建设世界一流大学不可能千校一面，各个学校在发挥优势的同时，必须彰显个性和特色。</seg>
          <seg id="10">办学特色既要有共性的中国特色，也要体现各自独特的目标定位、办学传统和资源禀赋。</seg>
          <seg id="11">就浙江大学而言，我们在办学中注重突出三个方面的特色：一是突出创新创业人才培养特色，构建科教融合、校企结合的整合育人环境，形成全链条的创业教育生态系统；二是突出学科交叉会聚特色，推动学科体系的优化调整，营造学科交叉的制度环境，积极培育交叉新兴学科和标志性交叉成果；三是突出办学体系和社会服务特色，开展深度国际交流合作，加快形成泛浙大产学研合作体系。</seg>
          <seg id="12">在这个过程中，尤为重要的是，要始终坚守大学精神，让大学精神与时代精神同频共振。</seg>
          <seg id="13">对于浙江大学来说 ， “ 求是创新”校训 ， “ 勤学、修德、明辨、笃实”共同价值观以及“海纳江河、启真厚德、开物前民、树我邦国”共同构成了浙大精神的最新表述体系。</seg>
          <seg id="14">这是学校坚持正确办学方向，不断积累文化高度、凝聚精神力量的重要保障，内涵丰富，意义深远。</seg>
          <seg id="15">其中 ， “ 海纳江河”强调的是开放包容精神，体现以“天下英才为我所用”的胸怀，表现为汲取世界名校办学育人的优质理念 ； “ 启真厚德”强调的是求真至善精神，指的是大学在追求真理的同时，更当领受德行的陶冶和人格的砥砺 ； “ 开物前民”体现的是改革创新精神，既包含知识的求新，科研的创新，又表现为改革发展，革故鼎新 ； “ 树我邦国”强调的是爱国奉献精神，讲的是大学应当始终与民族命运同荣共辱。</seg>
          <seg id="16">这一系列精神理念和价值追求，正是浙江大学120年办学的灵魂所在。</seg>
          <seg id="17">“聪者听于无声，明者见于未形 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="18">中国高校当进一步立足中国特色社会主义事业全局，深刻把握高等教育事业所处的时代方位和肩负的历史使命，加快建设成为世界一流大学。</seg>
          <seg id="19">同时，坚守人文关怀和独立自由，让大学精神与时代精神、民族精神互相激荡，从而为实现国家富强和民族振兴，实现人类的共同理想提供不竭的动力。</seg>

          <seg id="3">Axie Infinity is a pet grooming game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT, and it is the NFT project with the highest trading volume now, exceeding US $3 billion so far.</seg>

          <seg id="5">On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said their daily active users have surpassed one million.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The hotness of Axie Infinity has sent the new “palytoearn” pattern to more people; with the help of blockchain and intelligent contract, players are no longer a single character, and in addition to gaining pleasure and economic revenue from the game, they can also participate in the governance of game ecosystem.</seg>

          <seg id="1">(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the end of the “Democratic Summit” on Friday, The Foreign Ministry spokesman of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11) to express that the “Leaders’ Summit on Democracy” held by the U.S. actually “makes democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy with the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation, to change domestic contrasts”.</seg>
          <seg id="2">According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has imposed its own political systems and value systems on others, to carry out democratic transformation, and has sanctioned others in a unilateral way, and has instigated Color Revolution, leading to disastrous consequences.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Democracy has been the weapons of mass destruction of the U.S. in intervening other countries.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The meeting of 2 days was held in a way of video, and leaders of 111 countries all over the whole world were invited to attend the meeting, including the leader of Taiwan, China; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited.</seg>
          <seg id="6">China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.</seg>
          <seg id="7">There were questioned voice internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for some leaders invited to the summit who had the trend of autocracy, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and Biden government was doubted to have the real intention of the geopolitics but not democracy.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Scholz, the Chancellor of Germany who had just took the post, was also invited to the video democratic summit.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “The American democracy today greatly shows the morbidity, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Biden, the U.S. President, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of Democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability governance, to fight against the power of autocracy and those people who barely intend to pursue for authority before public benefits. “</seg>
          <seg id="11">As he emphasized, democracy is not taken for granted, “we must keep update it in all generations, which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era. “</seg>
          <seg id="12">Biden also expressed that  with respect to global democracy and human rights, “democracy should be guarded by fighters when facing with continuous and worrying challenges”.</seg>
          <seg id="13">As committed by the U.S., there will be year-long actions after this democratic summit, including a proposal with the amount of 424.4 million USD, so as to reinforce global democracy and provide support for independent news media.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and opened commitments before the democratic summit held in the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.</seg>
          <seg id="15">According to Biden, “all our countries shall implement our commitments and report the progress in the next year”.</seg>

          <seg id="2">兰州交通大学3名学生给校领导写信，反映对大学考试的困惑，并提出提高考试难度，变换考试题型，让考试真正体现学生实际水平的诉求。</seg>
          <seg id="3">的确，长期以来，大学考试都是一个“热门话题 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="4">在大学校园，学生来自五湖四海，能力水平各不相同，再加之学习程度不一，学习的情况千差万别。</seg>
          <seg id="5">对于具有如此多元特征的群体进行考核，存在不同感受，在所难免。</seg>
          <seg id="6">当然，如果考试试题题型单一、重复率高，题目过于简单，必然会造成另一种截然不同的感受。</seg>
          <seg id="7">不用功的学生，可能考前集中突击就能及格，如若再想其他办法，有可能达到事半功倍的效果。</seg>
          <seg id="8">如此一来，就出现“学渣”平时不投入也能过关、甚至得了高分 ； “ 学霸”平时从不落课，作业、笔记样样好，考试也没高出多少的“怪现状 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="9">这样看来，兰州交大的学生反映大学考试中存在的问题并非毫无来由，相信这种状况也不只兰州交大存在。</seg>
          <seg id="10">从这层意义上讲，要为这3名写信直陈的学生点赞。</seg>
          <seg id="11">其实，上过大学的人都清楚，突击备考、想各种办法从老师处“套取”考题，争取划考试范围，求得考前得到“重点辅导”的现象并不少见，甚至在考试中夹带小抄、考后求老师高抬贵手的情况也不是奇闻。</seg>
          <seg id="12">在笔者看来，作为一种教学质量评估导向，衡量一所大学考试的合格与否，更在于教师对教与学的全面把握，以及在此基础上的科学命题。</seg>
          <seg id="13">进入大学本科阶段，专业开始细分，很多专业课程以基础知识为主。</seg>
          <seg id="14">毋庸置疑，是否全面掌握一个学科的基本知识点，是大学考试要考察的内容。</seg>
          <seg id="15">而本科知识基本都是学科基础理论和基本常识，从知识点而言，变化的空间并不大，基本是固定的。</seg>
          <seg id="16">就像有教师所言 ， “ 20年前学大学数学的基本知识，现在还在学，还是重点 。 ”</seg>
          <seg id="17">但知识点基本不变，并不代表考试题型单一、试题重复。</seg>
          <seg id="18">在很多大学，考试一般都会组成出题组，再由学科资深教师统筹组成试卷，考试阅卷也由承担该科的全体老师参与，这样就能在一定程度上克服试题重复的情况。</seg>
          <seg id="19">但要拟出一套符合教与学实际的试题，题目根据学生学习整体情况，难易呈正态分布，还需综合掌握教学情况，全面分析学生学习的程度，从而使考试命题对难易、题型有动态把握，既能突出基础知识考察，又能兼顾能力考查，同时对题型进行创新设计。</seg>
          <seg id="20">考试是大学教育的指挥棒，有什么样的考试，学生就会有相应的备考方案，长此以往，将影响大学教育的成效。</seg>
          <seg id="21">对于学生的建议信，兰州交大校方高度重视，已在全校部署了整改的方案。</seg>
          <seg id="22">要求各教学单位组织教师开展研讨和课程结课考试对照自查，制定考试试卷命题及相关制度，同时加强对考试试卷命题及审核环节的监督与检查，细化成绩评定，加强课程教学各环节的全面考核。</seg>
          <seg id="23">从机制上解决试题类型单一、题目重复等问题是大学考务需要面对的议题，当然需要出台相应的制度，但功夫贵在日常，需要教师对教学情况的全面掌握，不单要吃透教学内容，更须吃透学生学习情况，两头吃透，教与学将更好对接，形成良性互动，考试也将更加符合实际，从而让“学霸”和“学渣”各得其所。</seg>

          <seg id="1">Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet</seg>
          <seg id="2">Three students in Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to leaders of the university to reflect their confusion on examinations in university, and raised the ideas to increase the difficulty of examinations, change types of questions and let the examinations reflect the real learning level of students.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Indeed, examinations in universities have been a “heated topic“ for a long time.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Students on campus come from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels; due to different efforts spent in study, their situations of study vary significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It is inevitable for different feelings about the examinations to exist in such a diversified group.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Certainly, it will cause a completely different experience if there are few types of questions, the questions are repetitive or too simple.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.</seg>
          <seg id="8">As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where “slack students” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In this way, the problems in college exams reflected by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not groundless; it is believed that such situations do not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this sense, we should applaud for the three students who wrote the letter to reflect the problem directly.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring “key tutoring” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In the view of the author, as a guidance for teaching quality evaluation, judging if the exams in a college are qualified or not relies more on the comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the setting questions scientifically on this basis.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Majors are segmented after entering the undergraduate study, and many specialized courses are carried out with basic knowledge as the main content.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Undoubtedly, whether the students have mastered the basic knowledge is a content to be inspected in the exams in college.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Knowledge during the undergraduate study is mainly basic theories and common sense of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, they are basically unchanged and there is not much room for variation.</seg>
          <seg id="16">As some teachers have said, “the mathematical basic knowledge in college twenty years ago is still being taught today and it is still a key content.”</seg>
          <seg id="17">However, the unchanging basic knowledge points do not mean there can be single type or repetitive questions.</seg>
          <seg id="18">There will usually be a group working on setting test questions for the exams, and senior teachers of the subject will coordinate and compile a test paper; marking test papers will be undertaken by all teachers of the subject; this can in a sense overcome the situation of repetitive questions.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.</seg>
          <seg id="20">College exam is the baton of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exams will influence the effect of college education in the long run.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter of advise from the students; it has deployed the scheme for rectification in the university.</seg>
          <seg id="22">It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to deliberate and conduct self-inspection on exams at the end of a course, formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and review, specify grade evaluation work, and strengthen comprehensive inspection on various links of course teaching.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Reflection on education: How can college examination make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places - Xinhuanet</seg>
          <seg id="3">Indeed, college examination has always been a “hot topic” for a very long time.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Students in campuses are from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels, as well as different learning conditions due to varied learning degree.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It is unavoidable that there are different feelings on the examination on groups with such diversified characteristics.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Of course, single question types, high repetitive rate and excessively simple questions will lead to another totally different feeling.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Students who do not study hard can pass the exam with focused review before exam; if they have other methods, they may half the work with double results.</seg>
          <seg id="8">In this way, “study slackers” can pass exams or even with high scores although they do not study hard; however, “super scholars” have scores not obviously higher than “study slackers” although they attend each class and do well in assignments and notes.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In this way, the reflection of the problems in college exams by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University is reasonable; it is believed such status does not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.</seg>
          <seg id="10">From this point, the 3 students who wrote the letter shall be praised.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In fact, all people who have been to colleges know that there are frequent phenomena of focused review, “extracting” exam questions from teachers, knowing the scope of the questions and acquiring the “key coaching” before exam; even more, there are phenomena of bringing notes to exam rooms or begging teachers to give high marks after exams.</seg>
          <seg id="12">According to the author, as a tool for teaching quality evaluation, in order to measure if the college exam is qualified or not, it is on comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the scientific questions on this basis.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Specialties are divided in details after entering into the undergraduate college stage, and many specialized courses are taught based on basic knowledge.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Without a doubt, the comprehensive mastering of the basic knowledge points of a specialty is the content to be inspected by college exams.</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, the knowledge of the undergraduate courses is basically basic specialty theory and basic commonsense, with not much space for changes from the point of view of knowledge points, which is basically fixed.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Just as what teachers said, “the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still key point at present. ”</seg>
          <seg id="17">However, no change in knowledge points does not represent for single exam question types and repetition of questions.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In many universities, there is the group of questions for exams, and senior teachers of related specialties arrange the papers, and the paper inspection work is participated by all the teachers of related subjects; in this way, it solves the problem of repetitive questions to certain extent.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficult degree according to general learning conditions of students, analyze learning degree of students, to lay emphasis on both basic knowledge inspection and ability inspection; at the same time, it is necessary to conduct creative design on question types.</seg>
          <seg id="20">College exam is the wand of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exam will give rise to influences on effect of college education for a long run.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter from the students, and has deployed the scheme for rectification in the whole university.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Various teaching units are required to organize teachers to develop discussion and self-inspection on class ending exam, and formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, and strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and audit, and detail grade evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive check on various teaching links.</seg>
          <seg id="23">It is a inevitable topic for college exam to solve problems such as single question types and repetitive questions from the perspective of mechanism; it is necessary to release corresponding systems; in addition, teachers are required to master teaching conditions in a comprehensive way by mastering both the teaching contents and the learning conditions of students; it is necessary to connect between teaching and learning, to form benign interaction and make exam in accordance with practical conditions, so as to make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Because I didn’t arrange my time well before the shoot, I rescheduled twice and consultant Lanlan patiently arranged time for us.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Later we chose a weekend with nice weather to shoot it.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The staff at Mrs. Gold, no matter it’s consultant or makeup artist, are fantastic.</seg>
          <seg id="5">That was the first time that I had officially put on makeup and wow, I couldn’t even believe that I could be so pretty one day, haha.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Xiaojie and the other girl (sorry, I forgot her name) were super patient while doing my makeup and the makeup was natural.</seg>
          <seg id="7">We shot the outdoor scene at Jiangwancheng, and fortunately the weather was nice that day, we didn’t feel cold; during the shoot, makeup artist was paying attention to our clothes, headwear, and made adjustment immediately once there was a problem.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The photographer was funny, and we were happy throughout the day.</seg>
          <seg id="9">When choosing the photos, I saw many cases online where they wouldn’t let the customers delete too many photos, but they didn’t ask us to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the set and nothing more (I heard that my cousin who was also taking wedding dress photos added photos worth over 10,000 in addition to the 7,000 yuan set, and I was stunned and feared I might choose too many).</seg>
          <seg id="10">The editing was finished today and Lanlan sent it to me; I felt two were not good enough and they immediately re-edited them for me.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I found the old photos of my sister to make comparison, and I felt that our photos were really satisfying, simple and fresh, exactly what I wanted.</seg>

          <seg id="4">All staffs of Mrs. Gold, including the counselor, the makeup artist and the photographer, were really excellent.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Xiaojie and another girl (sorry that I forgot her name) made a natural makeup for me with patience.</seg>
          <seg id="7">We shot the outdoor scenes in Jiangwan City on a sunny day, and we did not feel cold; the makeup artist always noticed our clothes and headwear during shooting, and kept sorting them out for us.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The photographer was really humorous, so that we were always happy during the whole day.</seg>
          <seg id="9">We had saw some cases that many wedding photography stores tried their best to make customers keep as more photos as possible during choosing photos; however, the staffs there did not show any intention to make up add more photos except for the 24 ones in the package (I heard that many girls who shot wedding dress photos chose additional photos of more than 10 thousand yuan in addition to the package of more than 7 thousand yuan; I was astonished then, and afraid that I would choose too many).</seg>
          <seg id="10">The editing of the photos was finished today, and Lanlan sent the photos to me; I was not satisfied with two of them, and they edited them for me again immediately.</seg>
          <seg id="11">When comparing my wedding dress photos with those of my little sister, I was really satisfied with my photos, they were simple and fresh, with the style I like best.</seg>

          <seg id="5">他说，有关问题在2个月前就出现，砂拉越也面对同样的问题。</seg>
          <seg id="6">“其中一个原因是生产特制防伪纸的中国厂家受疫情影响，导致延迟运抵我国 。 ”</seg>

          <seg id="2">(source of video: YouTube)</seg>
          <seg id="3">On December 11, a short documentary named Killing Machine went viral on YouTube.</seg>

          <seg id="5">The US army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing squad with distorting human nature.</seg>

          <seg id="1">无意中看到如下一篇文章，从商业的角度以及保存期的角度谈为什么这个客户要保税区里面的物流公司帮做罐装，虽然罐装属于深加工，不属于保税物流公司的经营范围，这里如下这篇文字也许可以解释 为什么客户想要这么做？</seg>
          <seg id="2">我去很多奶粉的厂家，接触很多奶粉的生产线。</seg>
          <seg id="3">其实袋装跟听装的奶粉它们的原材料是一模一样的，没有任何区别的。</seg>
          <seg id="4">那么大家肯定会问：为什么袋装保质期是一年，而听装的保质期是两年或更长呢？</seg>
          <seg id="5">或者又问：听装与袋装的价格为什么差价这么大呢？</seg>
          <seg id="6">其实从这点出发很多消费者，或者妈妈级的认为这是因为原材料不一样所以质量上会好很多。</seg>
          <seg id="7">其实原材料一样，只是大家认为贵的就是好的。</seg>
          <seg id="8">也有消费者出于这种心态吃了后反应还说听装的口感或味道就是不一样！</seg>
          <seg id="9">现在我跟大家先说一下听装贵的原因，贵在哪里？</seg>
          <seg id="10">它们的原材料相同为何差价如此之大呢？</seg>
          <seg id="11">因为厂家在定价的时候大多数都考虑到如果袋装定价太高，消费者很难去接受，这就意味着厂家产生的利润很低，或者说没有利润，那厂家靠什么去生存呢？</seg>
          <seg id="12">所以他们在听装的定价上，有了一个很大的上升幅度来保障他们的利润空间。</seg>
          <seg id="13">因此大多数厂家主推的是听装，而不是袋装。</seg>
          <seg id="14">还有你想那么多的厂家每年的广告费都要几千万甚至是几个亿，这个费用何来？</seg>
          <seg id="15">大家可想而知。</seg>
          <seg id="16">那么随着社会的发展，市场的推广费用，比如说：商场的促销人员、商场的陈列费用、产品的赠品费用、广告费用等也在不断的增加。</seg>
          <seg id="17">所以各个厂家也在不断地增加新品，而且是听装，其价格也是不断地上涨，其实这是随着市场费用的增加而出的新品。</seg>
          <seg id="18">主要目的是为了获取更高的利润，其实他们的原材料增加的成本最多不会超过3、4元钱。</seg>
          <seg id="19">还有一部分品牌，为了推广自己的产品，不择手段，跟医院的医生挂钩，由他们协助产品的推广，从一听里面抽成30元到80元不等的利润。</seg>
          <seg id="20">而中国的相关法律是绝对不允许这样的操作方式方法的，其实这种做法是在坑害消费者。</seg>
          <seg id="21">建议大家在家里有罐的前提下买袋装的奶粉装入罐中，这样可以节省费用，而增加奶粉的保存性和密封性，对小孩子也没有任何影响。</seg>
          <seg id="22">还有大家不要认为听装的保质期就比袋装长，如果在开包以后听装与袋装的保质期是一样的，只是说袋装开包以后不容易保存，容易受潮变质。</seg>

          <seg id="1">I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life; although canning is deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text perhaps can explain why the customer wants to do this.</seg>
          <seg id="2">I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and gained contact with many production lines of milk powder.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Actually, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and in cans are exactly the same.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Then you may ask: why is the shelf life of milk powder one year in bags and two years or longer in cans?</seg>
          <seg id="5">Or you may ask: why are the prices of bagged and canned milk powder so different?</seg>
          <seg id="6">Actually, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Actually, the raw materials are the same, and people just think the goods are more expensive because they are better.</seg>
          <seg id="8">There are also customers in this mindset who say that the taste is indeed different after drinking it!</seg>
          <seg id="9">Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Why are the prices so different when the raw materials are the same?</seg>
          <seg id="11">When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on?</seg>
          <seg id="12">Therefore, in the price setting of the canned ones, they set it much higher to guarantee their profits.</seg>
          <seg id="13">As a result, many manufacturers recommend canned ones instead of bagged ones.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Everyone knows it.</seg>
          <seg id="16">With the development of society, the market promotion expenses kept increasing, such as the cost of promotion personnel at shopping malls, the display expenses of products at shopping malls, the cost of gifts of products, advertising expenses, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products in can packaging, and the price kept rising as well; in fact, these new product are introduced due to the increase of market costs.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The main objective is to gain more profits; the increased cost of raw materials is actually no more than 3 or 4 yuan.</seg>
          <seg id="19">There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, cooperate with doctors in the hospital by all means, and ask them to assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from one can.</seg>
          <seg id="20">China’s relevant laws by no means allow such operations because this practice is in fact harming consumers.</seg>
          <seg id="21">It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans if you have cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation time and hermetic seal of milk powder; it won’t have any influence on the children.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned ones is longer than that of bagged ones; the shelf life of canned ones is the same as that of bagged ones after unpacked; it’s just that bagged ones are not easy to be preserved and are easy to become damp and deteriorate.</seg>
        </p>
      </ref>
      <ref lang="en" translator="B">
        <p>
          <seg id="1">I’ve read the following article by chance which discusses on why customers require logistics companies in the bonded area to provide canning services on the perspective of commerce and storage period, although canning is a kind of deep processing, not belonging to the operation scope of logistics companies; the article can explain why customers want them to do so.</seg>
          <seg id="2">I’ve contacted various production lines of milk powder in many manufacturers.</seg>
          <seg id="3">In fact, bagged milk powder and canned milk powder have the same raw materials, with totally no difference.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Then some people may ask: why the expiration date for bagged milk powder is one year, and that for canned milk powder is two years or even longer?</seg>
          <seg id="5">Or: what is the reason of such large difference in price between bagged milk powder and canned milk powder?</seg>
          <seg id="6">Many consumers or mothers of infants think there are differences in raw materials, and canned milk powder has much better quality.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In fact, the raw materials of the two types are totally the same; however, people think expensive products are better.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Because of this idea, some consumers even say that canned milk powder tastes better!</seg>
          <seg id="9">Then I’ll tell you the reason for the high price of canned milk powder.</seg>
          <seg id="10">What is the reason for such big difference in price since they have totally the same raw materials?</seg>
          <seg id="11">When pricing for products, most manufacturers consider that it is difficult for consumers to accept bagged products with high price, which means low profit or even no profit for manufacturers; then how do manufacturers to survive?</seg>
          <seg id="12">Therefore, they set a much higher price for canned products, so as to ensure their profit space.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For this reason, most manufacturers popularize canned products but not bagged ones.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In addition, the advertising expense for each year is generally dozens of million yuan or even hundreds of million yuan, then where do they get the money?</seg>
          <seg id="15">You can imagine.</seg>
          <seg id="16">With the development of the society, there are increasingly grown expenses in market promoting, such as the expenses for promoters in shopping malls, the expenses for display in shopping malls, the expenses for gifts of products and the expenses for advertisement.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Therefore, various manufacturers keep increasing new products, canned new products, with increasingly grown price; in fact, these are the new products released due to the increase in market expenses.</seg>
          <seg id="18">They are released to acquire higher profits; in fact, the increased cost in raw materials is no more than 3 or 4 yuan.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Some other brands play hard in order to promote their products by cooperating with doctors in hospitals, who will be provided with commission of 30 – 80 yuan for each can.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Such operating methods are absolutely forbidden by Chinese laws; in fact, this practice is entrapping consumers.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Consumers are suggested to pour bagged milk powder into cans, to save expense; in this way, it increases the storage and sealing property of milk powder, with no influence on children.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In addition, in fact, the expiration date of canned milk powder is the same as that of bagged milk powder after unpacking; however, it is difficult for bagged milk powder to be stored, which is easier to be affected with damp, leading to moisture deterioration.</seg>

          <seg id="2">逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。</seg>
          <seg id="3">现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="4">等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。</seg>
          <seg id="5">正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。</seg>
          <seg id="6">这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。</seg>
          <seg id="7">因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。</seg>
          <seg id="8">对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。</seg>
          <seg id="9">绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。</seg>
          <seg id="10">马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。</seg>
          <seg id="11">“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。</seg>
          <seg id="12">或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。</seg>
          <seg id="13">“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。</seg>
          <seg id="14">总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。</seg>
          <seg id="15">由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。</seg>
          <seg id="16">只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。</seg>
          <seg id="17">总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。</seg>

          <seg id="2">We can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle”, which first assumes or implies that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what it is” that you need to do.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it”.</seg>
          <seg id="5">As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The “best principle” will make every reader believe it is “absolutely right”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The majority of people will be timid in front of “change”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to “change” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent.</seg>
          <seg id="10">From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity”.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people “sigh at the beginning”.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Or, the “second best principle” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere,</seg>
          <seg id="16">It’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle”.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In all, although the “best principle” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the “second best principle” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.</seg>

          <seg id="4">As much as to say, the most important and the most fundamental link of “how to do it” is passed.</seg>
          <seg id="5">For this reason, these books have the same characteristic: either doing the best or doing nothing; either 100 or 0; either climbing on the Mount Tai or keeping standing still.</seg>
          <seg id="6">All people will regard the “best principle” “really correct”; however, 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because this theory advocates a path that “you need to make the resolution to totally change yourself”, which is just the critical weakness of many people.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If you shout “you need to change” loudly to people who stick to conventions and refuse changes, it is deceiving yourself as well as others and casting pearls before swine.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Most people display their ignorance before the word “change”, and difficult to make the resolution; or they may make the resolution of “change” because of momentary impulse, and take the first step; however, good times don’t last long, and it is very difficult for them to insist on it.</seg>
          <seg id="10">From Tomorrow on, the cross talk of Mr. Ma Sanli, expresses the “common humanity” in the most vivid way.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the very high starting difficulty, which exceeds the limit of ability of ordinary people, making most people “bemoaning inadequacy in the face of a great task”.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Maybe the “second best principle” is the way that makes more ordinary people step to success.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The core of the “second best principle” is on “lowering down the threshold”; it advocates to the theory of “accumulating small progresses to make large ones”; i.e., people who cannot achieve 100 can achieve at least 1, because 1 is always larger than 0; if people cannot climb on Mount Tai, they can also climb on the small sand dune around home, because it is better than marching on the spot.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In general, it’s better than doing nothing as long as you do something.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The possibility of insisting for ordinary people is greatly increased due to great drop in the starting difficulty, and the success possibility is increased as long as people can insist on it.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The journey to success by observing the “second best principle” is a little longer.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In general, although the “best principle” advocates to make all people success, it can encourage only a small part of people; however, the “second best principle” can encourage more people, to try to make more people gain benefit.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Report from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Gymnocypris przewalskii, commonly known as “scaleless carp”, is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an indispensable role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water, fish, bird” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In 2004, gymnocypris przewalskii was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.</seg>
          <seg id="6">From 2003, Qinghai province implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing gymnocypris przewalskii in the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of gymnocypris przewalskii and their products.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Qinghai three-rivers area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of fishing ban of “one river, one river, and one lake”.</seg>

          <seg id="4">During 1960s and 1970s, due to influences of factors such as battue and increasingly degraded environment in the water areas for naked carp, the number of the naked carp in the Qinghai Lake declined sharply; the reserves of the naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons in 2002.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed into the endangered species in China Species Red List in 2004.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Qinghai Province has implemented closed lake for breeding fish since 2003, and any unit, group or individual is forbidden to fish in Qinghai Lake and main rivers and tributary of the lake region, and the sale or the naked carp or the products is also forbidden.</seg>
          <seg id="7">At the same time, the protection intensity has been increased by measures such as artificial proliferation and discharge, cleaning up the river ways of main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable “channels for fish”, leading to increase of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake by years.</seg>
          <seg id="8">According to introduction by Yang Lin, deputy director general of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, up to now, totally 180 million naked carp has been conducted with artificial proliferation and discharge in Qinghai Lake, with the rate of contribution to recovery of the naked carp resource in Qinghai Lake of more than 23%.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Sanjiangyuan Region in Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area for our country or even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area which controls the extension of the west desert to the east.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In order to protect the ecological environment of Sanjiangyuan Region and the Qinghai Lake Basin, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biological diversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has published the announcement of no permission of fishing in key water areas such as the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake this year, to construct comprehensive fishing prohibition in “two-river and one-lake”.</seg>

          <seg id="1">刚看到一篇写例假的文章，太长了。</seg>
          <seg id="2">给不知道的男性科普一下。</seg>
          <seg id="3">大部分女孩子会在13-15岁期间的某一天突然经历第一次例假，在50岁左右闭经。</seg>
          <seg id="4">之后身体健康的前提下会比较规律地每个月来一次。</seg>
          <seg id="5">但也不是规律到能精准预测，大概一周左右的公差，需要提前准备，有时候运气差也会翻车（突然提前好几天）。</seg>
          <seg id="6">时间长度、血量、痛经程度因人而异，有些人三天，有些人一周；有些人流的少，有些人大血崩；有些人没什么反应，有些人疼到救护车运走，痛经随着时间会改变，以前不痛不代表一辈子不痛。</seg>
          <seg id="7">月经无法控制，开始到结束为止的几天内24小时流血，能做的只有用卫生巾或卫生棉条吸血防止流到衣服椅子上。</seg>
          <seg id="8">痛经主要是因为前列腺素的分泌，生理期刚开始还没来得及痛经时赶紧吃布洛芬可有效缓解当月疼痛，痛经开始后再吃没什么用。</seg>
          <seg id="9">生理期前由于子宫充血和前列腺素释放过多，容易拉肚子。</seg>
          <seg id="10">如果大概到了周期，莫名其妙拉肚子，基本上两天内会来月经。</seg>
          <seg id="11">卫生巾最好两三个小时更换一次，不然容易滋生细菌，除去睡眠时间，最坏的情况是一天更换6次，每月7天，那就是42片，如果加上提前准备的份可能有50片，并不是每个月用一片。</seg>
          <seg id="12">（此处修改一下，卫生棉条不必常换，大概五六小时换一次就可以，最长八小时）</seg>
          <seg id="13">月经期荷尔蒙作祟可能会比较暴躁，排卵期也会因为体内激素变化情绪不稳定，就是很倒霉，身体给自己使绊子。</seg>
          <seg id="14">但官方犯罪率数据能看出女性控制情绪的能力还是很高的，也不会拿情绪问题找借口。</seg>
          <seg id="15">流的并不只是血，其中包含脱落的子宫内膜。</seg>
          <seg id="16">月经结束后的子宫内膜最薄，之后慢慢变厚，可以理解为子宫是房子，每个月建房子（内膜变厚）准备迎接客人，客人没有来，全部拆掉（月经排出）下个月再建新房子，周而复始。</seg>
          <seg id="17">月经很不方便，连续几十年，每个月几天24小时流血，还会腹痛腰痛，谁愿意？</seg>
          <seg id="18">但是人能出生是因为他的母亲来过月经，月经是为了准备你第一次来到这个世界时要住10个月的房子，大家要感谢自己的母亲规律健康的来过月经。</seg>
          <seg id="19">以前女性的很多事情被打压，社会给女性洗脑说是肮脏的，羞耻的，大家以为就是那样了，但时代变了。</seg>
          <seg id="20">如果有人觉得月经恶心，觉得女性的身体为孕育生命做出的准备行为恶心，不该在大庭广众之下说出来，女孩子们站起来，不要再这么想，从未经历过，这辈子也不会经历，也不怎么了解的男性们，不要那么忘恩负义不知好歹，这种态度怎么好意思面对自己的母亲，怎么好意思想要自己的孩子？</seg>
          <seg id="21">最后，姐妹们试试卫生棉条吧，真的好用。</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">I just read an article about period, and it’s too long.</seg>
          <seg id="2">I’ll introduce to men who don’t know about it.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Most girls will get their first period between 13 to15 years old, and have amenorrhea around 50.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Then they get period regularly once every month on the premise of good health.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But it is not so regular that you can precisely predict it; there is a difference of around a week; you need to prepare early and sometimes you may get unlucky and it arrives several days earlier.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person; some people have it for three days and some people a week; some people have small flow and some people have way too much; some people don’t have any reaction, and some people feel so painful that they have to be taken away by the ambulance; dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not having it before doesn’t mean it won’t happen for a lifetime.</seg>
          <seg id="7">You can’t control menstruation; you bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is absorb blood with pads or tampons to prevent it from getting onto clothes or chairs.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins; Taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of dysmenorrhea that month before menstruation begins, but taking it is useless to after dysmenorrhea begins.</seg>
          <seg id="9">It is easy to have diarrhea before the period due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.</seg>
          <seg id="10">If you are near the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason at all, you will basically get your period within two days.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It is best to replace sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria; apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, and that is 42 pieces; if you add the ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not just one piece every month.</seg>
          <seg id="12">(a little modification here, tampons do not need to be changed often; it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)</seg>
          <seg id="13">Hormones during menstruation may make you irritable, and ovulation may also make you emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very troublesome; your body makes itself suffer.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, you may see from the official crime rate data that women’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It’s not just blood, but also endometrium that fall off.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens; you may think that the uterus is a house; you build a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests, and if the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstruation flows out) and a new house is built next month, which starts again and again.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Menstruation is very inconvenient; you bleed 24 hours a few days a month for dozens of years, and it also causes abdominal pain and lower back pain; who would want that?</seg>
          <seg id="18">But people are born because their mother has menstruation; menstruation exists to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months before you come to this world; everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In the past, many things about women were suppressed; society brainwashed women and told them it’s dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that; but times have changed.</seg>
          <seg id="20">If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, the female body’s preparation for life is disgusting, and it shouldn’t be said in public; girls, stand up and don’t think this way; men who have never experienced it, won’t experience it in this life, and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and unkind; how can you face your mother and children in this attitude?</seg>
          <seg id="21">Finally, sisters, try tampons; they are really easy to use.</seg>

      <ref lang="en" translator="B">
        <p>
          <seg id="1">I’ve just read a very long article about girls’ menstruation.</seg>
          <seg id="2">I’ll popularize it to men.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Most girls experience the first menstruation during 13 – 15 years old, and amenorrhea will come at about 50 years old.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Then the menstruation comes regularly once every month in condition of good health.</seg>
          <seg id="5">However, it is not very accurate, and there is a tolerance of about one week, in need of preparation in advance; it may come several days earlier if girls have bad luck.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Time duration, blood volume and dysmenorrhea degree vary with each individual; some girls need three days and some others need one week; some girls have small amount of blood volume and some others have extremely large amount; some girls have no reaction at all, but it is so painful for others that they are taken to the hospital by an ambulance; dysmenorrhea changes with time, and some girls suffer from dysmenorrhea suddenly although they did not suffer from it at all.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Girls’ menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds 24h a day within those days; all what girls can do is to prevent blood from bleeding to clothes or chairs with menstrual pads or tampons.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused because of the secretion of the prostaglandin; oral taking of ibuprofen before the menstruation can solve the dysmenorrhea of the current month; however, nothing will work after the start of the menstruation.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Girls may have loose bowels before the menstruation due to metryperemia and too much release of prostaglandin.</seg>
          <seg id="10">If girls have loose bowels around the period, menstruation will come within two days.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It is suggested to change the menstrual pad every two or three hours, or it may breed germs; the menstrual pad shall be changed for at least 6 times a day if sleeping time is excluded, 7 days a month, and 42 pieces of menstrual pads are needed for each period; there may be 50 pieces when taking the ones for preparation in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="12">(I’ll make a correction, and it is not necessary to change the tampons, about every five or six hours, eight hours at most).</seg>
          <seg id="13">Girls may be irritable during the period due to hormone, and they may have instable emotions due to changes in hormone; in a word, it just like body makes them feel awkward.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, according to crime rate disclosed by official data, girls have very high ability in emotion control, and they don’t seek excuses for emotional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The articles bleeding out include both blood and the endometrium falling off.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The endometrium after the menstruation every month is the thinnest, and then it gradually gets thicker; it can be understood like this: the uterus is a house, and the house is built every month (the endometrium gets thicker) to welcome the guest, but the guest does not come, and the house is taken down totally (the menstruation is discharged), and a new house will be built the next month; it goes round and round.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Menstruation leads to inconvenience to girls; girls bleed 24h a day for several days a month in continuous dozens of years; who want to suffer it?</seg>
          <seg id="18">However, only girls with period can give birth to a baby, and menstruation; menstruation is coming in order to prepare for the house babies will live when they come to the world; people shall be grateful to the regular menstruation of their mother.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Women were often suppressed in the past, and some things were described as dirty and ashamed; however, times have changed.</seg>
          <seg id="20">If somebody feels menstruation disgusting, which is the behavior of women in order to give birth to a baby, they should not say it publicly; girls shall not have such an idea, and men who do not understand it shall not be ungrateful; how can they face their mothers and have their own babies with this attitude?</seg>
          <seg id="21">Girls can have a try of tampons, and they are really good.</seg>

          <seg id="5">“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”</seg>
          <seg id="6">李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。</seg>
          <seg id="7">李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。</seg>
          <seg id="8">李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。</seg>
          <seg id="9">后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。</seg>
          <seg id="10">因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。</seg>
          <seg id="11">但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。</seg>
          <seg id="12">因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。</seg>
          <seg id="13">水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。</seg>
          <seg id="14">同时你可以随便拿电笔测。</seg>

          <seg id="3">现如今绝大多数遇难者的老父母均已谢世，遗孤们也已长大成家就业。</seg>
          <seg id="4">是你们的义举帮助我们这些蒙难家庭度过了最为艰难的时刻。</seg>
          <seg id="5">目前新冠疫情正在全球肆虐，大多数的捐款者也已年届退休。</seg>
          <seg id="6">因此，我恳切地请求你们中止给我们难属——天安门母亲群体人道捐款，这项人道救助活动早就应该画上完美的句号了。</seg>
          <seg id="7">我将永远铭记你们的爱心，并坚信你们的义举必将为历史铭记。</seg>
          <seg id="8">由于种种原因，我只能以此方式表达自己的意愿，请朋友们谅解！</seg>

          <seg id="16">这些项目的资金，主要来自六四当年的校园和社会捐款，来自个人的慷慨捐助，并受到兄弟大学民主基金会的支持。</seg>

          <seg id="2">I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the death of our family, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Now the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up, started working and got married.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It is your chivalrous deeds that have helped these families in distress pass the most difficult time.</seg>
          <seg id="5">At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to the family of victims, Tiananmen Mothers group; this humanitarian relief event should have come to a perfect end long ago.</seg>
          <seg id="7">I will remember your kindness forever and firmly believe your chivalrous deeds will be remembered by history forever.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way; please understand!</seg>
          <seg id="9">Please accept my sincere wishes.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Tao Yean: please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In the process of humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are parallel organizations, and there are often intersections between the project executors.</seg>

          <seg id="13">The relief funds often fail to reach the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement successfully.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In 1994, Ding advised that the “Tiananmen Mother” set up a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan Education Fund”; after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from University, MCDF then established the “June 4th Elderly with No Family Destitute Poverty Relief Fund”, which has been implemented until now.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations of generous individual donations in the year of June 4th event, and were supported by the democracy foundation of brother universities.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Last year, after 31 years, the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a part of the donation made by Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.</seg>
          <seg id="19">During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief project.</seg>
          <seg id="20">We understand that Ding called a stop to the June 4th donation for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed retired elderly, and our income is not as much as before; we hereby thank teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.</seg>
          <seg id="21">We will respect the decision of the family of the victims and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately when necessary.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous fellows who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.</seg>

          <seg id="2">I want to show my thanks to all the humanitarian aid provided by my friends within more than 30 years since our relatives died in the accident; especially, the aid has never been interrupted till now since I appealed to foreign friends in my name in 1994.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Parents of most victims have passed away, and their orphans have been grown up and have got married or got a job.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It was your magnanimous act that helped families like mine passed the toughest time.</seg>
          <seg id="5">At present, the coronavirus pandemic is spreading all over the whole world, and most donors will retire soon.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humanitarian donation to the mothers of the Tian An Men group, which should have been ended at an earlier time.</seg>
          <seg id="7">I will forever bear your love in mind, and will firmly believe that your magnanimous act will be remembered by the history.</seg>
          <seg id="8">I have to express my will due to some reasons, and please forgive me!</seg>
          <seg id="9">Please accept my sincere wishes.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Note from Tao Ye: Please allow me to introduce the history of the humanitarian act by IFCSS and MCDF for 32 years.</seg>
          <seg id="11">During the humanitarian act, IFCSS and MCDF are two parallel organizations, with intersection in executors of projects.</seg>

          <seg id="13">Sometimes, the aid fund could not be delivered to the relatives of the victims of the June 4 event.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In 1994, as suggested by Teacher Ding, a special group was established, in charge of receiving and distribution of the humanitarian donation.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In 1998, Children’s Education Fund for Orphans of June 4 was established by MCDF; after implementation of 11 years, when all the orphans graduated from schools in 2009, MCDF established the Relief Fund for Helpless Elderly and Poor Households, which has been implemented until now.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The funds of the projects were mainly from campus and social donations, as well as the MCDF.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Laogai Research Foundation has provided support from 2018.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Up until the last year, 31 years later, the relatives of the victims received part of the fund donated from Hong Kong.</seg>
          <seg id="19">During this period, China Human Rights was implementing its humanitarian aid independently.</seg>
          <seg id="20">We understand that Teacher Ding appealed to stop the donation because of thinking for the donors; we are actually retired elderly, with not as abundant salary as we did not retire; we are really thankful to the letter of “To my friends”.</seg>
          <seg id="21">We will respect the decisions of the relatives of the victims and will stop the project within 2 years, and will recover it immediately if it is necessary to do so.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I also want to show my thanks to the friends who helped others generously with money with risks.</seg>

          <seg id="13">We work in Beijing, and better studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance; I have a colleague who did the photoshoot in Beijing and felt the photos were just so so.</seg>
          <seg id="14">I specifically found this studio, a place with soul and attitude.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Our facial expression management was poor, and I think this is a problem for most people, but photographer Liang is good at capturing the natural and wonderful moments.</seg>
          <seg id="16">A brilliant team with makeup artist, photographer and post-editing design.</seg>
          <seg id="17">After the photos came out, we and everyone around us were full of praises for them.</seg>
          <seg id="18">I have recommended my girlfriend to come, who was also satisfied with the photos.</seg>

          <seg id="1">一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。</seg>
          <seg id="2">如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。</seg>
          <seg id="3">但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。</seg>
          <seg id="4">要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。</seg>
          <seg id="5">当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。</seg>
          <seg id="6">首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。</seg>
          <seg id="7">其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。</seg>
          <seg id="8">你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。</seg>
          <seg id="9">比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。</seg>
          <seg id="10">如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。</seg>
          <seg id="11">但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。</seg>
          <seg id="12">另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。</seg>
          <seg id="13">如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。</seg>
          <seg id="14">而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。</seg>
          <seg id="15">以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。</seg>

          <seg id="1">I am a programming newbie and I want to share my experience.</seg>
          <seg id="2">If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to get some training , but if you don’t want to, it’s better to study on your own; after all, trainings are expensive and it will take you six months to learn it.</seg>
          <seg id="3">However, if you want to enter this industry, then training is a great option, especially for those who are extremely not self-disciplined.</seg>
          <seg id="4">You can choose to teach yourself if you are self-disciplined, but it will be tiring.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Certainly, selecting a good training agency is very important.</seg>
          <seg id="6">You need to first look at the faculty of this agency; if it’s not strong enough, you can cross that agency off your list; of course, some new agencies don’t have strong faculties.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Secondly, you shall do some research on the agency before choosing it; it’s best to contact former students of the agency; after all, only students know how the agency really is and whether the curriculum is good or not.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Hello, actually I’m not sure how to answer your question since you didn’t introduce your own situation, and learning this is closely related to your situation.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you are in; all of these are related to what you want to learn or what industry you want to go into.</seg>
          <seg id="10">If you are a student who haven’t graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, then I recommend learning it yourself if you have time, and this is the method with lowest efficiency and cost; many offline and online training agencies are good now, but it comes with great cost and takes a lot of time; it basically needs a concentrated training of three to six months.</seg>
          <seg id="11">However, if you are in the same situation as I mentioned, it is convenient to learn it yourself; many learning resources are free online, or you can gain access to a lot of training resources on Bilibili; if you don’t know how to search for them, you can contact me according to my bio and get free resources or detailed consultation.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are also classic books to supplement your study with videos.</seg>
          <seg id="13">If you are not a computer major, but you can pay certain amount of money and devote your time to your learning, then I suggest you go to an agency to study; it’ll be easier this way as the teachers will explain in detail and there will be designated people answering your questions; in addition, it’ll be helpful to your study planning or help you get supervision.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Further, many training agencies will sign employment agreement; they have quota for internal promotion, and you can be recommended to a company after your learning, so that the job interview process can be easier.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The above is my opinion; as I said, I don’t know about your situation so my introduction is not detailed; if you want to consult other things, you may contact me any time.</seg>

          <seg id="1">A freshman in programming who would like to share personal experience</seg>
          <seg id="2">If you want to work in this industry, you can accept training in an institute; however, if you don’t intend to work on it, you’d better study independently; after all, you need to pay a lot of money for training; in addition, it spends you 6 months to do so.</seg>
          <seg id="3">However, if you intend to work on it, training is a really good choice, especially for those people with weak self-control ability.</seg>
          <seg id="4">People who have strong self-control ability can choose self-study, but it will be more tired.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Firstly, the most important thing is the teaching strength of the training institution; it’s meaningless for you to choose a training institution with weak teaching strength; of course, new training institutions usually do not have very strong teaching strength.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Secondly, you can ask something about the training institution before making selection; you’d better ask something from students of the training institution; after all, only students of the training institution can know it well and know the teaching quality.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Hello, in fact, I don’t know how to answer it, because you do not introduce your conditions; in addition, study is closely related to conditions of students.</seg>
          <seg id="9">For example, specialty, age, targeted language or even city are related to your study or your intended industry.</seg>
          <seg id="10">If you are a student in school or a graduate of computer major, and you have sufficient time, you can learn it by yourself, with favorable efficiency and the lowest cost; a lot of offline or online training institutions are good choices, but with high study cost and much time, and concentrated training of 3-6 months is required.</seg>
          <seg id="11">However, if you are of the condition that I mentioned before, self-study is the best choice; there are lots of free study resources in the Internet, or you can seek for training resources in b station; if you don’t know how to find the resources, you can contact me with the method in my introduction, to acquire free resources, or you can have detailed consultation to me.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In addition, some classical books can be utilized, in combination of videos.</seg>
          <seg id="13">If you are not a computer major and you can afford the training fee and the time cost, you can study in a training institution; in this way, you can study easily, for teachers there will give you detailed explanation and answer your questions; in addition, they can help a lot in study planning or supervision.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In addition, employment agreement will be signed by lots of training institutions, with internal recommendation quota, and you can be commended to work for a company; it helps really a lot in the interview of job search.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This is my opinions; I cannot have a detailed introduction because I don’t know a lot about your conditions; if you have any other question to ask, you can contact me at any time for communication.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Message from Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (journalists: Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia, Diriyah contemporary art biennale, was officially opened to the public in the JAX arts district of Diriyah in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on December 11, and a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries and regions participated in the exhibition.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The biennale is planned jointly by Diriyah biennale foundation of Saudi Arabia and UCCA of China, and Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA of China, works as the art director.</seg>
          <seg id="4">According to the introduction from the planning team, the theme of the biennale is “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, which is a metaphor of the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situations of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The biennale occupies an area of nearly twelve thousand square meters, and the exhibition hall stretches across six connected buildings with six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as an Experiment, Thinking at the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New Word and On the Spirit of Arts.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In which the number of the works of the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including various art forms such as drawing, installation art and performing art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists create with recycled materials in an innovative way; for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with wastes in Behind the Story Series, Picture of Endless Streams and Mountains (2014).</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to Buckley, CEO of Diriyah biennale foundation, it is hoped that the biennale can establish an international dialogue, provide global audiences with opportunities to understand the vigorously developed culture industry and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Tian Feiyu said, “The biennale has two objectives, i.e., establishing dialogue between contemporary art of Saudi Arabia and the world, and integrating audiences of Saudi Arabia into the contemporary art world.”</seg>
          <seg id="9">It is understood that there will be a series of lectures during the biennale, and artists, exhibition planners and leaders of innovative industries will engage in discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.</seg>

          <seg id="2">But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.</seg>
          <seg id="4">3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in.</seg>
          <seg id="6">4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards.</seg>

          <seg id="8">Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics.</seg>
          <seg id="9">If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!</seg>

          <seg id="3">The positive roles played by the right wing should not be denied on aspects of defining the standard of truth after the Cultural Revolution, improving science and technology by developing economy and administrative systemation and guarantee of human rights.</seg>

          <seg id="2">美帝打压中国芯片产业，要求自家企业及盟友国相关企业同时对我国芯片产业进行封锁，直接导致的后果就是全球芯片供应商的订单和利润受到影响，造成芯片生产企业的研发投入降低、产能下降，从而造成了全球范围内芯片供应链的短缺的紊乱。</seg>
          <seg id="3">如今“缺芯”已经波及到了全球各大行业，比如车企停产、手机涨价，几乎所有用到芯片的行业都深受其害。</seg>
          <seg id="4">为了掌握“芯片”自主权，越来越多国家的科技巨头开始走向“去美化”的道路。</seg>
          <seg id="5">为了牢牢把控全球半导体控制权，牵制中国半导体行业的发展，最近老美动作频频，又是主持“芯片峰会”；又是邀请64国巨头成立半导体联盟，并拔款扶持美国本土科技巨头，比如，美帝老牌科技巨头英特尔为了夺回在芯片领域的主导地位，斥资200亿美元在美国亚利桑那州建2座晶圆加工厂，并对外开放芯片代工业务。</seg>
          <seg id="6">当大多数人都以为，英特尔此番举动将对台积电造成一定冲击，并很有可能抢走台积电的“饭碗”。</seg>
          <seg id="7">之所以这么肯定，是因为，英特尔作为美帝老牌科技巨头，在半导体领域深耕几十年，拥有大量的人才队伍和技术储备，必定能在短期内迅速崛起，打败台积电。</seg>
          <seg id="8">然而，对于英特尔的这个决定，台积电创始人张忠谋却不屑一顾。</seg>
          <seg id="9">在今年四月举行的“2021大师智库论坛”上，张忠谋语出惊人，对于英特尔斥资建晶圆厂这个举动，张忠谋毫无顾忌直言：英特尔建芯片代工厂，相当讽刺。</seg>
          <seg id="10">张忠谋之所以对英特尔进军晶圆领域颇为不屑，是因为张忠谋对30多年前台积电与英特尔的一段恩怨依然耿耿于怀。</seg>
          <seg id="11">上世纪六七十年代，英特尔一直是美帝制造业中的明珠，雄居全球巅峰的位置，是世界半导体领域的霸主。</seg>
          <seg id="12">到上世纪80年代，世界半导体高端芯片一直被少数强者掌握。</seg>
          <seg id="13">当时半导体行业以IDM模式为特征，芯片从设计、制造到封测都是由一家工厂来完成，英特尔就是那个时代的代表。</seg>
          <seg id="14">然而这样的模式让一些小企业不堪重负，很多半导体创业者面对巨额的产线建设费用只能望而却步。</seg>
          <seg id="15">在市场需求的感召下，进入80年代后，芯片行业开始出现分工合作的现象，1984年张忠谋听说有专门做芯片设计的公司，便认为既然有专门做设计的，那么就可以成立一家专门用于晶圆制造的工厂。</seg>
          <seg id="16">不久之后，张忠谋的设想变成了现实，台积电应运而生。</seg>
          <seg id="17">台积电把主营业务瞄准了“晶圆加工”这个单一环节，不进行设计，只提供晶圆制造的代工服务。</seg>
          <seg id="18">当时刚创立的台积电，在英特尔这个巨无霸面前就是小喽啰。</seg>
          <seg id="19">为了获取资本支持，张忠谋就曾找英特尔投资，但当时英特尔一听说台积电只做芯片行业的制造环节，显然有些自视甚高，看不起台积电，果断拒绝对台积电进行投资。</seg>
          <seg id="20">张忠谋也认定英特尔当时是看不起晶圆制程服务的。</seg>
          <seg id="21">没想到当年看不起晶圆制造服务的巨头，如今却也要开始做晶圆代工。</seg>
          <seg id="22">所以，张忠谋觉得英特尔进入晶圆代工很讽刺。</seg>
          <seg id="23">如今台积电的市值已经超过了英特尔。</seg>
          <seg id="24">面对台积电的强势进攻，英特尔自然也是不敢固步自封。</seg>
          <seg id="25">如今，台积电已经向着3nm芯片冲刺，而英特尔仍然停留在7年前的14nm。</seg>
          <seg id="26">想要赶超其实并非易事。</seg>

          <seg id="2">The US suppresses China’s chips industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of its allies to block China’s chip industry at the same time; the direct consequence was that the number of orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in the decrease in the investment of research and development and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which further led to the disorder of chip supply chain shortages on a global scale.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Today, “lack of chips” has affected all major industries of the world, resulting in the suspension of production of car enterprises and rise in prices of mobile phones; almost all the industries using chips are greatly impacted.</seg>
          <seg id="4">To gain the right to make their own decisions on “chips”, more and more countries’ tech giants are taking the path of “de-Americanized”.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In order to firmly holding the right to control global semiconductor in its hands and pin down the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States have made frequent moves recently such as hosting the “chip summit”, inviting the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocating funds to support the local technology giants in the United States; in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, US and opened its chip OEM business.</seg>
          <seg id="6">When most people think Intel’s move will make certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and even steal their job.</seg>
          <seg id="7">They are sure about it because Intel, as an old tech giant in the US, worked diligently in the semiconductor industry for dozens of years and have a large amount of talent teams and technological reserve; it is bound to rise within a short time and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.</seg>
          <seg id="8">However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel.</seg>
          <seg id="9">At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark and spoke bluntly about Intel’s move to build a wafer factory, “it is rather ironic for Intel to build an OEM factory of chips”.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel’s decision to get into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhong still holds a grudge against a feud between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel more than 30 years.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the leading position in the world; it was a king in the semiconductor industry in the world.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been controlled by a few strong ones.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode; chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by the same factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.</seg>
          <seg id="15">To respond to the calling of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation of chips industry began to appear; in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s imagination became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was created.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aimed to set the single link of “processing of wafers” as its primary business; without design, only OEM services of wafer manufacturing was provided.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was only a small player in front of Intel the giant.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but Intel was arrogant when it heard Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company only participated in the manufacturing of the chips industry; Intel looked down on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and resolutely refused to invest in it.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer manufacturing services at that time.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Unexpectedly, the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back in the days will also start to do wafer foundry now.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to work on wafer foundry.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has surpassed that of Intel.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Facing the powerful attack of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally dares not to stand still.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is trying to develop to the 3nm chips, and Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Today, “lack of chips” has been spread to all major industries all over the whole world; halt production of car enterprises and rise in price of mobile phones, almost all the industries in need of chips are greatly influenced.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Most people consider that the action of Intel will lead to certain impact, and may grab the “job” of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.</seg>

          <seg id="10">The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel to produce wafers is because that Zhang Zhongmou still takes the resentment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to Intel 30 years ago to heart.</seg>
          <seg id="11">During 1960s – 1970s, Intel was a pearl of the manufacturing industry of the U.S., ranking top all over the whole world, and was the powerful chief of the global semiconductor field.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Up until 1980s, the global high-end chips had been always mastered by a few of giants.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The IDM mode was the characteristics of the semiconductor industry at that time, and the production of chips including design, manufacturing and closed beta test were all completed by the same factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.</seg>
          <seg id="14">However, such a mode made some small enterprises overwhelmed; many entrepreneurs of semiconductors had to flinch when facing with the huge expenses for construction of production lines.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The division of labor occurred from 1980s in the chip industry due to market demands; Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were some companies engaged in design of chips in 1984, and thought that he could establish a plant in producing of wafers.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Before long, Zhang Zhongmou realized his imagination, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was established.</seg>
          <seg id="17">By aiming at the single link of “processing of wafers”, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company did not design wafers but only provided OEM services of wafer manufacturing.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The newly established company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was only a small potato in front of Intel, the giant in the industry.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In order to acquire capital support, Zhang Zhongmou went to Intel to talk about matters related to investment; however, when hearing that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was engaged in the manufacturing link only, Intel looked down upon Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and refused to make investment in it.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Zhang Zhongmou firmly believed that Intel looked down upon the wafer manufacturing services.</seg>
          <seg id="21">However, the giant who looked down upon wafer manufacturing in those days decides to work on OEM of wafers today.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is really ironic for Intel to work on OEM of wafers.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has exceeded that of Intel.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Facing with the powerful attack from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel does not dare to stand still and refuse to make progress.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has developed to the 3nm chips; however, Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It is really difficult to catch up and surpass.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.</seg>
          <seg id="2">What is normal public opinion?</seg>
          <seg id="3">Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.</seg>
          <seg id="4">They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="5">What is abnormal public opinion?</seg>
          <seg id="6">Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].</seg>
          <seg id="7">[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.</seg>
          <seg id="8">In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together.</seg>

          <seg id="3">We choose three top search topics randomly: Dragon Heads-raising Day, rise in price of Orion and the event of LaLaMove; the public opinions spread and form a wave peak, and then [reduce exponentially] (with a smooth curve), and finally disappear; there will be a small hump in condition of secondary public opinions.</seg>

          <seg id="6">We choose six top search topics of the same event randomly, showing the [isolated peak shape], the [sawtooth shape] and the [bluff shape].</seg>
          <seg id="7">The [isolated peak shape] is generated due to artificial heating, to give rise to attention from the public; the [sawtooth shape] is periodical heating, to ensure the topic ranks on the top ones; the [bluff shape] means collectively evacuating; i.e., the top search has finished its “function”, and new tasks have been received.</seg>
          <seg id="8">In Figure 9, the wave peak of an event is just the wave bottom of another event, with exact time; undoubtedly, the same group of online water army receives a new task and starts working.</seg>
          <seg id="9">We can see the professionality of anti-public relation: dozens of top search topics are ranking in the list at the same time; some attract attention, some are in charge of science popularization, some are picking fights, some are changing attention of the public, some are giving rise to influences on cognition, some are misleading judgment of the public, some are stirring up emotions, some are coercing in making decisions; the anti-public relation accounts attack with batches and nodes by taking almost all the factors in spreading of public opinions.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Spreading is a science; anti-public relation cannot hide depending on only objective data by putting all subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions aside.</seg>

          <seg id="3">一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。</seg>
          <seg id="4">来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。</seg>
          <seg id="5">我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。</seg>
          <seg id="6">他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。</seg>
          <seg id="7">我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。</seg>
          <seg id="8">这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。</seg>
          <seg id="9">他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。</seg>
          <seg id="10">除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。</seg>
          <seg id="11">我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。</seg>
          <seg id="12">当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。</seg>
          <seg id="13">无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。</seg>
          <seg id="14">各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。</seg>
          <seg id="15">坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。</seg>
          <seg id="16">所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。</seg>

          <seg id="2">Address: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156</seg>
          <seg id="3">I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.</seg>
          <seg id="4">A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.</seg>
          <seg id="5">When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.</seg>
          <seg id="7">As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.</seg>
          <seg id="12">When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.</seg>
          <seg id="16">So please don’t choose such a swindler company.</seg>
          <seg id="17">When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.</seg>
          <seg id="18">If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Address: Floor 12, Happy Home, No. 156 of South Ring Road</seg>
          <seg id="3">I went there because of recommendation by one of my friends, and I planned to make a basic decoration with the budget of 70 thousand yuan.</seg>
          <seg id="4">I suffered a series of tricks as soon as I went there.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It was my first visit to the shop, and I just showed them my floor plan; unexpectedly, they gave me the offer of 70 thousand yuan for decoration of my house of 135m2 before they had field measurement; they showed me something about their materials of brands that I did not know.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Their second trick was to push you to pay the deposit as soon as you arrived at their shop (the money that they will never refund unless you have enough energy to argue with them).</seg>
          <seg id="7">When I was hesitated about the deposit, they invited their “manager” to tell me that I could be provided with considerable discounts as long as I paid the deposit on that day.</seg>
          <seg id="8">This was really a big trick, and I was cheated to pay the deposit of more than 10 thousand yuan on impulse.</seg>
          <seg id="9">However, there were many problems in their offer: the budget of 70 thousand yuan did not include water and electricity transformation, any door, cabinet or bathroom, which were actually the major part in basic decoration.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In addition, they charged service fee higher than other similar companies.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I don’t trust the company now, and they pushed me to sign the contract as soon as I arrived there before making anything clear.</seg>
          <seg id="12">When I returned there to ask them make refund, their specialized team argued with me in a very experienced way.</seg>
          <seg id="13">They blamed all responsibilities on customers.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They tried their best to shift the blame to other shoulders, with really many details which I don’t want to tell one by one; in a word, don’t choose them, and the home of one of my friends, a decoration work undertaken by them, too, had really poor decoration quality; in addition, they added various expenses during later stage.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cheaters, their company is the Longtou Decoration originally, wahich was renamed as Damei later, and it seems that Damei has closed down and is renamed as another name.</seg>
          <seg id="16">So please don’t choose a cheating decoration company like this.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Please check decoration companies in Baidu when you want to choose one, because what we spend in decoration is a lot of money.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Please log in or register if you want to ask questions to merchants.</seg>
          <seg id="19">It is strictly prohibited to publish comments on merchants of various types, and please refer to statement on commercial tenants for details.</seg>

          <seg id="1">激光电视和传统电视在市场定位上有何差异？</seg>
          <seg id="2">以我的理解，题主所说的传统电视应该指的就是液晶电视，而激光电视和液晶电视在市场定位上的差异，主要有以下两点：</seg>
          <seg id="3">第一，激光电视更聚焦大屏市场。</seg>
          <seg id="4">相比液晶电视全面铺开的市场定位，激光电视显然更聚焦大屏市场，或者说激光电视本身就是为大屏而生的产物。</seg>
          <seg id="5">目前，主流液晶电视尺寸多在55英寸到65英寸，而激光电视的尺寸一般在75英寸以上，最大的超过100英寸，充分满足用户对大屏彩电的需求。</seg>
          <seg id="6">近年来，激光电视在全球的出货量和销量占比都在不断增加，在80英寸及以上总体电视销量中占比超六成。</seg>
          <seg id="7">根据中怡康的预测，2020年，激光电视市场销量增长将超过140%，继续保持高速增长。</seg>
          <seg id="8">之所以在大屏市场有如此好的成绩，主要归功于激光电视在护眼方面的出色表现。</seg>
          <seg id="9">基于激光电视漫反射的成像原理，激光光源发出的光线并不直射入眼球，相比液晶电视的背光源发光，成像过程更接近自然条件下物体的成像过程，对眼睛产生的刺激也更小。</seg>
          <seg id="10">中国电子技术标准化研究院赛西实验室和北京协和医院眼科专家，通过人群相同条件下观看激光电视和液晶电视的严格对比试验，得出了144组测试数据。</seg>
          <seg id="11">数据证实：激光电视的确具有很强的护眼特性，在特定方面甚至具有一定的改善作用。</seg>
          <seg id="12">在视力健康越来越受重视的当下，激光电视不仅凭借护眼优势吸引了越来越多用户，也打开了彩电市场的另一个突破口。</seg>
          <seg id="13">第二，激光电视更聚焦高端市场。</seg>
          <seg id="14">与液晶电视价格不断下探相反，目前市售激光电视的价格大多在万元以上，随着尺寸和光源的升级，价格逐步攀升。</seg>
          <seg id="15">激光电视凭什么卖这么贵呢？</seg>
          <seg id="16">肯定是有道理的。</seg>
          <seg id="17">在光源和技术水平的不断发展下，激光电视有很多液晶电视和投影都无法实现的优势。</seg>
          <seg id="18">凭借超短焦距投影技术，激光电视的投影距离相对传统投影设备来说要更短，能够在短距离内实现100英寸大屏体验，所需空间不大，而且主机小巧，占用地方很小。</seg>
          <seg id="19">在亮度方面，大品牌激光电视可以达到2000以上的流明。</seg>
          <seg id="20">加之发热量更低，对设备损耗小，电视的使用寿命也更长。</seg>
          <seg id="21">除此之外，很多高端激光电视机型还搭载了真4K超高清画质、人工智能系统、仿生屏等众多前沿技术，能够给用户带来更震撼的视听体验。</seg>
          <seg id="22">谈不上伪需求，而是需求细分的产物，论画质和投入产出比，激光电视不是影音玩家的菜，想兼顾大屏和观看环境不足，可以尝试，凡事皆有利弊，权衡过后自己判断即可，就怕听信一面之词。</seg>
          <seg id="23">简单说，超广角近焦投影机--激光电视，为了贴近幕布，不得不使用价格昂贵的超广角透镜和反射镜，这不符合光学最佳设计。</seg>
          <seg id="24">为了屏蔽部分环境光，使用微结构的菲涅尔幕布，代价高昂，80寸的价格基本能换个65寸液晶。</seg>
          <seg id="25">还有一点，我特别讨厌投影厂商拿漫反射对眼睛好这种当卖点，拜托，眼睛能够看到的幕布上的光线对于眼睛而言就是直射光，你漫反射到天花板上，眼睛也看不到，非要较真液晶电视也是漫“直射”，打开电视天花板不也被照亮吗？</seg>
          <seg id="26">而且，投影幕布如果不是漫反射，根本成不了像。</seg>
          <seg id="27">恰恰被忽略了高增益幕布的热斑（光斑）效应，某一角度大量光线反射到眼睛，那才是真难受。</seg>

          <seg id="1">What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of the market positioning?</seg>
          <seg id="2">In my understanding, traditional TV which the original post mentioned is LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly the following two points:</seg>
          <seg id="3">First, laser TV focuses more on big screen market.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Compared with the all-round market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of big screen.</seg>
          <seg id="5">At present, the size of mainstream LCD TV is mainly from 55 to 65 inches, and the size of laser TV is usually over 75 inches, with bigger ones over 100 inches, which can satisfy the customers’ need for big screen TVs.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In recent years, the proportion of the global shipments and sales of laser TV keeps increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to the prediction of CMM, the sales volume of laser TV market in 2020 will increase by over 140% and will continue to maintain a high-speed growth.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The reason for such great result in the big screen market is mainly the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection .</seg>
          <seg id="9">Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eyeball; compared with the backlight of LCD TV, its imaging process is closer to that of objects under natural conditions, with less irritation to the eyes.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Ophthalmologists from CES Laboratory, China Electronics Standardization Institute, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Statistics prove that laser TVs can indeed protect the eyes and may even make improvement in certain aspects.</seg>
          <seg id="12">As eye protection is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attracted more and more customers with the feature of eye protection, but also made another breakthrough in the market of color TVs.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Second, laser TV focuses more on high-end market.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Contrary to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, price of laser TVs on the market now is over 10,000 yuan, and it went up gradually with the upgrading of size and source of light.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Why are laser TVs so expensive?</seg>
          <seg id="16">There must be a reason.</seg>
          <seg id="17">With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have advantages that many LCD TVs and projectors don’t.</seg>
          <seg id="18">With the super short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment; it can realize the 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance; the space required is not large, and the small host takes up very little space.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In terms of lightness, laser TVs from famous brands can reach over 2,000 lumens.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Plus, the heat is lower, equipment loss is small, and the service life of TV is longer.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with real 4K ultra HD image, artificial intelligent systems, bionic screens and other cutting-edge technologies, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience.</seg>
          <seg id="22">It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, ultra wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.</seg>
          <seg id="24">In order to shield part of the ambient light, it uses an expensive microstructure Fresnel screen; the price of an 80-inch laser TV basically can be changed into a 65-inch LCD TV.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused “direct light”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?</seg>
          <seg id="26">Moreover, if the projection screen does not use diffuse reflection, imaging is not possible at all.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle being reflected into the eyes is really uncomfortable.</seg>

      <ref lang="en" translator="B">
        <p>
          <seg id="1">Is there any difference between laser television and traditional TV?</seg>
          <seg id="2">According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic owner shall be the liquid crystal display TV, and the differences between laser TV and liquid crystal display TV are listed as follows:</seg>
          <seg id="3">Firstly, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market.</seg>
          <seg id="4">When compared with the totally spread market positioning of liquid crystal display TV, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market; or we can see laser TV is the product generated for large-size screen monitors.</seg>
          <seg id="5">At present, the size of mainstream liquid crystal display TV is between 55 – 65 inch, and that of laser TV is generally above 75 inch, or even more than 100 inch at most, fully meeting the demands of customers on large-size screen monitors.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In recent years, the global sales volume and the global sales proportion of laser TV have been increasingly grown, with the proportion of more than 60% in total sales of TV of or above 80 inch.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to prediction by The Yee, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by 140% in 2020, continuing keeping a high speed increase.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The excellent performance in the large-size screen monitor market is mainly attributed to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Based on the diffuse reflection image-forming principle of laser TV, the ray of light sent by laser light source does not directly shine into eyeballs; when compared with the ray of light of backlight of liquid crystal display TV, its image-forming process is close to that of articles in natural conditions, leading to smaller stimulation to eyes.</seg>
          <seg id="10">According to the strict comparative trial between watching laser TV and liquid crystal display TV by the same people groups in the same conditions conducted by Ceci Lab of China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, 144 groups of testing data have been acquired.</seg>
          <seg id="11">According to data: laser TV actually has strong eye protection property, which even plays improving role in specific aspects.</seg>
          <seg id="12">At present, vision health has been paid with more and more attention, laser TV has attracted more and more users due to the advantage in eye protection; in addition, it breaks through another field for the color TV market.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Secondly, laser TV lays more emphasis on high-end market.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Different from the increasingly lowered price of liquid crystal display TV, the price of most laser TVs is above 10 thousand yuan, which gradually increases with the upgrading of size and light source.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Why can laser TV be so expensive?</seg>
          <seg id="16">There must be some reasons.</seg>
          <seg id="17">With constant development of the light source and the technical level, laser TV has lots of advantages when compared with liquid crystal display TV and projection.</seg>
          <seg id="18">With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, when compared with the traditional projection equipment, laser TV has shorter projection distance, which can realize the 100 inch large-size screen experience within a short distance, in need of small space; in addition, the host occupies only a small space.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In view of brightness, the laser TV of a big brand can achieve the lumen of more than 2000.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In addition, with lower heating amount and less damage to equipment, it achieves longer service life.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Besides, multiple leading technologies such as the true 4K ultra high definition, AI system and bionic screen are equipped for the laser TV, providing users with more shocking audio and video experience.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In fact, it is the product of demand division; in terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audio and video players; users can have a try about large-size screen and insufficient watching environment; however, the same knife cuts bread and fingers, and don’t trust all opinions of only one party.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Simply, in order to get closer to the curtain, the ultra-wide field short-focus projector – laser TV, has to use the ultra-wide field lens and the reflector with expensive price, which is not in accordance with the optimal design of optics.</seg>
          <seg id="24">In order to shield part of ambient light, the very expensive Fresnel curtain with microstructure is utilized, and the price of 80 inch is almost equal to a liquid crystal display TV of 65 inch.</seg>
          <seg id="25">In addition, I hate it very much when projection manufacturers take the diffuse reflection, which is propagated as being good for eyes, as the selling point; the ray of light on the curtain is the direct light for eyes, and the ray of light diffused to the ceiling cannot be seen by eyes; if you insist on it, liquid crystal display TV is also “diffuse reflection”, isn’t the ceiling lightened when you open the TV?</seg>
          <seg id="26">Besides, if the projection curtain is not diffuse reflection, no image can be formed.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The heat spot (facula) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored; if large amounts of ray of light on a certain angle are reflected to eyes, it is really uncomfortable.</seg>

          <seg id="1">小雨伞买保险，靠谱吗?</seg>
          <seg id="2">小雨伞是一个互联网的保险经纪平台。</seg>
          <seg id="3">从设置条件来看：按照《保险经纪机构监管规定(2015年修订)》提示来看，成为保险经纪公司的，必须满足三个关键词：股东、发起人最近3年无重大违法记录、最低限额为人民币5000万元才可以成立、必须经过中国保监会同意。</seg>
          <seg id="4">这三条其实就是很苛刻的，总结起来就是要有实力，要经过银保监会（监管全国内的保险公司、银行）的国家权威部门批准、股东要有良好的作风，作为保险经纪公司的小雨伞保险，投保者是不用过多质疑小雨伞保险是正规的与否，毕竟有这3条门槛，不是什么保险公司都能达到的。</seg>
          <seg id="5">在这一点上，还不错，是值得信赖的。</seg>
          <seg id="6">从保险产品来看：小雨伞保险就是一个保险超市，很多公司的明星重疾险都在这家平台上出售，如最新上架的和泰超级玛丽5号重疾险，理赔方和承保方都是和泰人寿，小雨伞保险只是第三方中介，不用质疑它的靠谱性。</seg>
          <seg id="7">从缴费模式来看：互联网平台的产品，因为少了营业网点的经营费用，和业务员工资的成本，所以互联网产品普遍性价比比较高，而且缴费方式灵活，支持月缴，减轻投保人的缴费压力，同时可以最大限度的撬动保险的杠杆。</seg>
          <seg id="8">这点还是非常不错的。</seg>
          <seg id="9">可以考虑。</seg>
          <seg id="10">从业务员专业度来看：这点尤为重要，因为保险是一个专业度要求非常强的行业，很多互联网产品客户可以自己投保，这种就会存在很多的误区，在健康告知和职业这块，非保险从业人员往往在投保的时候会添加自己的主观意识，觉得自己健康或者符合，这样容易存在很多理赔隐患，有可能被拒赔的风险。</seg>
          <seg id="11">我自己曾在“腾讯微保”（和小雨伞一样，也是互联网保险经纪平台）做过保险电话销售，非常负责任的告诉大家。</seg>
          <seg id="12">互联网的保险是真的，也靠谱，不靠谱的是人，互联网渠道没有专业的从业人员，也有很多的销售误导。</seg>
          <seg id="13">比如：1元保险保600万，买保险送手机，免费领取6万重疾保额，这些营销策略没有错，可是却避重就轻，不会告诉投保人，首月1元，次月是需要按正常收费的，几十到200不等，很多客户扣费一两年自己买的是个啥不清楚。</seg>
          <seg id="14">以为可以花1块钱，保险公司赔600万（天下掉馅饼）。</seg>
          <seg id="15">免费送手机，是保单尾号比如6666，8888这种特殊保单号段才送的，并且如果中奖短信发出，自己不兑换，也没有人提醒的。</seg>
          <seg id="16">（这对于投保人来说，就又是一个坑）免费领6万重疾保额，是短期的，如果只靠这个，没有其他商业险，万一真发生重疾，6万能干嘛，解决不了问题，以后的生活开始裸奔。</seg>
          <seg id="17">目前对于互联网保险销售的误导，国家也在严厉打击。</seg>
          <seg id="18">所以综合来看，平台是没有问题，产品也没有问题，有问题的是业务员的专业度和职业操守。</seg>
          <seg id="19">建议题主综合慎重考虑，其实很多线下保险经纪公司的产品更广，客户可以选择的机会和产品更多，有些产品的性价比也优于互联网产品。</seg>
          <seg id="20">我自己就帮助过59位互联网客户，承保线下产品，保费每个人节约2000-3000元/年。</seg>
          <seg id="21">如果大家有什么疑问，欢迎与我沟通和交流。</seg>
          <seg id="22">我：明亚保险经纪人，有过3年企业管理培训经验，服务过近千家企业用户，合作超过100家保险公司，在投保前，我会从客户需求出发，为客户量身定制保险产品，投保中，为客户货比三家，尽力为客户争取最好的核保结果，投保后，为客户做保单整理，保单托管，让客户放心无忧。</seg>
          <seg id="23">跟每个客户一起终身成长。</seg>
          <seg id="24">希望我的回答能够对题主有所帮助！</seg>
          <seg id="25">根据保险监管部门的定义，互联网保险就是投保人点击投保链接后，可以自主完成所有的投保流程的保险业务。</seg>
          <seg id="26">在这个过程中，投保人不需要签字，保险顾问也不需要签字，所有步骤全部都可以由投保人自主完成。</seg>
          <seg id="27">虽然互联网保险的投保没太有“仪式感”，甚至可能连打印版的纸质合同都没有，但是这丝毫不影响电子版合同的有效性与法律效力。</seg>
          <seg id="28">这种模式，有点类似于“电话销售”一般的流水线作业，但如此购买保险也会有一个致命的问题，那就是——后续的服务可能会跟不上。</seg>
          <seg id="29">保险通常是一份长达几十年的长期契约，我们在购买保险的时候，是不是应该认真思考一下，我们所选择的这个“中介”，是不是一个可以与我们长期相伴、在很多年后也会给我们提供服务的“保险中介人”呢？</seg>

          <seg id="1">Is it safe to buy insurance on Little Umbrella?</seg>
          <seg id="2">Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the internet.</seg>
          <seg id="3">In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.</seg>
          <seg id="4">These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In this regard, it is not bad and worth trusting.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, with star serious illness insurances of many companies on sale on this platform; for example, for the newly added HTLIC Super Mario 5 serious illness insurance, both the claim adjuster and the insurer are HTLIC, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only the third-party intermediary, whose reliability does not need to be questioned.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is good.</seg>
          <seg id="9">It can be considered.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I worked as insurance telemarketing personnel in “Tencent Micro-Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The insurance products on the internet are real and reliable, and it is the people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners on the internet, and there is much misleading information in sales.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they’ve been charged for one or two years.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They thought they could spend 1 yuan and get a six million claim settlement from the insurance company (pie in the sky).</seg>
          <seg id="15">Getting mobile phone for free means only policy ending with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888 can get a free phone, and no one will remind you again if the text message is sent to you and you don’t redeem it yourself.</seg>
          <seg id="16">(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Our country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales at present.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Therefore, there is no problem with the platform or the products; what matters is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.</seg>
          <seg id="19">It is suggested that the original post should think about it carefully; in fact, there are many offline insurance brokerage companies with a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from; some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, helping each person save 2000-3000 yuan of premium per year.</seg>
          <seg id="21">If you have any question, feel free to communicate with me.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I am a Mingya Insurance Broker and have three years of experience in enterprise management training; I have served almost a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I will analyze the needs of my client and customize products for them; while insuring, I will compare all the insurance companies and help my client achieve the best underwriting result; after insuring, I will organize and hold the insurance policy to make my client feel at ease.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Grow with each client for a lifetime.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Hopefully my answer will help the original post!</seg>
          <seg id="25">According to the definition of insurance supervising departments, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insuring link.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In this process, neither the applicant nor the insurance consultant needs to sign, so all the steps can be fulfilled independently by the applicant.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although insuring an Internet insurance product has no “sense of ritual”, and even there is no printed copy of contact, it doesn’t affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contract at all.</seg>
          <seg id="28">This pattern is somewhat similar to assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but buying insurance this way will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades; when we buy insurance, shouldn’t we seriously consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?</seg>

          <seg id="1">Is it reliable to buy insurance on the platform of Small Umbrella?</seg>
          <seg id="2">Small Umbrella is an online platform of insurance brokers.</seg>
          <seg id="3">In terms of the setting conditions: According to the prompt in Regulation on Insurance Brokerage Institutions (modified version in 2015), insurance brokerage companies shall meet three key words: shareholder, no major illegal record during the latest 3 years of the launcher, minimum amount of 50 million yuan, and approval by China Insurance Regulatory Commission.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In fact, the three stipulations are rigorous, which can be summarized as being powerful, being approved by national authorities of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (the authority in charge of supervising all domestic insurance companies and banks), and good style of work of shareholders; as an insurance brokerage company, Small Umbrella Insurance is a regular company; after all, not all the insurance companies can achieve the 3 requirements.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Therefore, it is trustful.</seg>
          <seg id="6">In terms of the insurance products: The Small Umbrella Insurance is a supermarket of insurance products, and star products of many companies, i.e., the critical illness insurance, are sold on this platform; by taking the HTLIC Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance as an example, the compensation party and the insurer are both HTLIC, and Small Umbrella is just a third party intermediary agent, with no need to question its validity.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In terms of payment mode: Because of no operating expenses of sales networks and salary for salesmen, internet products generally have high cost performance, flexible payment method including monthly payment, which reduces the payment pressure of policy holders; at the same time, it can lift the lever to the maximum extent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is good.</seg>
          <seg id="9">It can be taken into consideration.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In terms of professionality of salesmen: This is the most important point; insurance is a industry with very strict requirement on professionality; however, customers can insure by themselves for many Internet products, leading to many wrong regions; with respect to health notification and occupation, non-insurance personnel often add their subjective awareness, and feel that they are healthy or they are in accordance with related stipulations, leading to many hazards in compensation, with risks of rejection.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I used to work as a staff of insurance telemarketing for “Wesure” (a platform of internet insurance brokers, just like Small Umbrella), and I can tell you in a responsible way.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Internet insurance is true and valid; however, some people say it not reliable because there is no professional practitioner for Internet sales channels, leading to many sales misleading.</seg>
          <seg id="13">By taking some marketing strategies as examples, 1 yuan for insured amount of 6 million yuan, a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan, there is no mistake for such marketing strategies, but the provisions may avoid the important and dwell on the trivial and do not tell policy holders that 1 yuan is for the first month only, the normal expense will be charged from the second month, from dozens yuan to 200 yuan; a lot of customers don’t know it even after fee deduction of one or two years.</seg>
          <seg id="14">They are misled to think they can acquire the compensation of 6 million yuan by spending only 1 yuan (fruit reaped without hard work).</seg>
          <seg id="15">With respect to a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, it refers to only special guarantee slip number such as 6666 or 8888; in addition, there is no prompt about it after the message of winning is sent.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan (another trap for policy holders) is a short-term activity; without other commercial insurance, 60 thousand can do nothing in front of critical illness, which solves no problem at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Our country is cracking down misleading in Internet insurance sales at present.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Therefore, generally speaking, there is no problem in platforms or products; but there are problems about the professionality and the professional integrity of salesmen.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The owner of the topic is suggested to consider in a comprehensive and deliberate way, and many offline insurance brokerage companies have more varieties of products for customers to choose; some products have better cost performance than Internet products.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I’ve helped 59 Internet customers insure with offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan/year for every one of them in insurance premium.</seg>
          <seg id="21">You are welcome to communicate and exchange with me if you have any question.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I, an agent of Mingya Insurance Brokers, have provided services to nearly 1 thousand enterprise users with the experience of enterprise management training of 3 years, and have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I customize insurance products for customers according to their demands; when insuring, I make comparisons among different products, to strive for the best underwriting results for customers; after insuring, I arrange and entrust guarantee slips for customers so that they can buy insurance with no worries.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Grow up together with each customer.</seg>
          <seg id="24">I wish that my answer can help others.</seg>
          <seg id="25">According to definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business that a policy holder can complete all the insuring process by himself after clicking the link of insuring.</seg>
          <seg id="26">During this process, neither the policy holder nor the insurance consultant needs to sign his name, and all the procedures can be completed by the policy holder only.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although there is no “sense of ceremony” in insuring for Internet insurance, or even there is no printed paper contract, it leads to no influence on validity and force of law of the e-version contract.</seg>
          <seg id="28">This mode is just assembly line work such as “telemarketing”; however, it may lead to a critical problem; i.e., there may be unfavorable follow-up services.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Insurance is generally a long-term contract as long as dozens of years, and we need to consider if the “intermediary agent” we choose can provide us with services many years later?</seg>

          <seg id="6">According to introduction, water green comprehensive service areas are important facilities that provide ships and sailors with comprehensive production and life services, to help them solve “emergent and difficult” problems.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The two water green comprehensive service areas newly constructed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with life services, production services and government services; by taking green and environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the features, they realize “comprehensive services at an anchoring” in the harbor, providing sailors in the Yangtze River all year long more efficient work and more convenient life.</seg>

          <seg id="1">跟朋友聊起最近Meta大跌 26%，市值蒸发 2510 亿美元，扎克伯格回应「面临前所未有的竞争」，原因为何？</seg>
          <seg id="2">Meta（原 Facebook）实质是一家广告公司，收入主要来自于广告，今时今日赚钱的广告公司，自己是有流量渠道的。</seg>
          <seg id="3">Facebook，Instagram，Whatsapp 等等，无论什么样的功能定位，都是 Meta 的流量渠道。</seg>
          <seg id="4">不仅如此，Meta 还是最大的”广告联盟”,很多 App 外接 Meta 的广告，通过 Meta 的广告平台是实现变现。</seg>
          <seg id="5">但是，时代变了。</seg>
          <seg id="6">第一，因为苹果隐私政策的调整，Meta 很难再拿到用户的数据信息，影响了广告投放的效率。</seg>
          <seg id="7">苹果现在的隐私政策对用户很友好，会很明显的提示用户是否允许 App 获取自己的信息，大多数人的正常反应肯定是不允许。</seg>
          <seg id="8">接下来如果 Google 再捅一刀，对 Meta 的收入影响还会更大。</seg>
          <seg id="9">第二，以前 Meta 的收入增长里的中国因素也弱化了（这个因素的比重不确定有多高，但确实存在）。</seg>
          <seg id="10">大家平时都知道 Meta 在中国是没有业务的，但是这个理解并不准确。</seg>
          <seg id="11">每年 Meta 至少10%的收入都来自中国，主要是中国做出海业务的公司贡献的。</seg>
          <seg id="12">Meta 在香港的办公室大概几百人，在大陆还有几大代理商。</seg>
          <seg id="13">中国公司想要拓展海外市场，Meta 都是绕不过的广告渠道，烧的钱大多都给了 Meta。</seg>
          <seg id="14">有意思的是，现在字节的 TT 是 Meta 主要的竞争对手之一，但是前两年 Meta 从字节身上可赚到不少钱。</seg>
          <seg id="15">国内各个代理都在帮字节去 Meta 那里投广告，Meta 大中华区的业绩也很不错。</seg>
          <seg id="16">最近我没有专门去了解，但是肯定不会比之前好。</seg>
          <seg id="17">中国公司在海外大规模烧钱的阶段已经过去了。</seg>
          <seg id="18">第三，新的流量渠道拓展不顺利。</seg>
          <seg id="19">Facebook 越来越老了，新的包括 TT 在内的平台，都不在 Meta 手中。</seg>
          <seg id="20">最大的问题不仅仅是收入下滑，而是缺乏增长预期。</seg>
          <seg id="21">资本市场不仅仅看中收入，更重要的是看未来的预期怎么样。</seg>
          <seg id="22">很显然，Meta 的预期是不够的。</seg>
          <seg id="23">为了给市场讲出新的故事，扎克伯格讲了 “元宇宙”.</seg>
          <seg id="24">元宇宙确实应该是未来的方向之一，但是元宇宙的实现周期比较长，这个故事在这两三年应该不足以支撑起 Meta 的市值。</seg>
          <seg id="25">所以未来这两年，应该是 Meta 比较艰难的时期。</seg>
          <seg id="26">别看脸书现在非常的风光，每年也有1,000亿到2,000亿美元的收入，实际上脸书现在危机感非常强，跟其他的互联网企业和高科技公司相比，没有什么好的安全的护城河。</seg>
          <seg id="27">虽然他的几款社交软件现在的日活比较高，也是主流的社交软件，比如Facebook，WhatsApp等等，但是面对tiktok的快速发展，脸书也没有什么信心，颠覆之间也就是眨眼的功夫。</seg>
          <seg id="28">而搞元宇宙这个可望而不可及的概念，短时间之内完全没有成功的希望，因此脸书非常的危险，这也是为什么扎克伯格又是换公司的名字，又是不停的寻找新的赛道的根本原因，但是我觉得他的赛道选择是错的，是一条不归路 以上是我的一些思考，供参考。</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">I talked to my friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and its loss of US $251 billion in market value; Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”; why?</seg>
          <seg id="2">Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising; the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel for traffic.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Regardless of its function positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all channels of traffic for Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertisement alliance”; Many apps are externally connected to Meta’s advertising, and they achieve realization through Meta’s advertising platform.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But, the time has changed.</seg>
          <seg id="6">First, due to the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users’ data information now, which affects the efficiency of advertising.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly; it will use explicit prompt to ask users whether they allow apps to access their own information; most people’s normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If Google stabs again next, it will have a greater impact on Meta’s revenue.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).</seg>
          <seg id="10">We all know that Meta doesn’t have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.</seg>
          <seg id="11">At least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are around hundreds of staff at its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.</seg>
          <seg id="13">When Chinese companies want to expand overseas market, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and so most of the money is given to Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Interestingly, the TT of ByteDance now is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.</seg>
          <seg id="15">All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to do advertising at Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.</seg>
          <seg id="16">I haven’t specifically learned about it recently, but it’s definitely not better than before.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The stage when Chinese companies were burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT is not in the hands of Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The biggest problem is not the decline of revenue but lack of growth expectation.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The capital market not only focuses on income; more importantly, it depends on future expectations.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Obviously, the expectation for Meta is not enough.</seg>
          <seg id="23">In order to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg told the story about “Meta-universe”.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Meta-universe indeed should be one of the future directions, but the period of the realization of Meta-universe is long, and this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Although Facebook is very popular now with an annual income of US $100 billion to $200 billion; in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis; compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is not any good security moat.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the DAU of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp; however, in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion could happen in the blink of an eye.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The unattainable concept of meta universe has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is in danger; this is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his choice is wrong and there is no way back; the above is some of my thoughts for reference.</seg>
        </p>
      </ref>
      <ref lang="en" translator="B">
        <p>
          <seg id="1">When talking about the crash of Meta by 26% and the market value evaporation of 25.1 billion USD, Zuckerberg replied 「facing with unprecedented competition」, then what is the reason for it?</seg>
          <seg id="2">Meta (the original Facebook) is an advertising company in the essence, with main income from advertisement; the advertising company earning money today has its own flow source.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., any functional localization is the flow source of Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="4">More than that, Meta is the largest”advertising alliance”, and many Apps cooperate with Meta in advertising, and change it into money through the Meta advertising platform.</seg>
          <seg id="5">However, time changes.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Firstly, it is very difficult for Meta to acquire the data information due to the adjustment in the privacy policy of Apple, which gives rise to influences on efficiency of advertisement putting.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The present privacy policy is friendly to users, and obvious prompt is provided about if the user allows the App to acquire his information, and most people choose no, of course.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Next, if Google gives an attack, it will lead to greater influences on the income of Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Secondly, the Chinese factor is weakened in the income growth of Meta (there is actually the factor, although the specific ratio cannot be determined).</seg>
          <seg id="10">As we all know, Meta has no business in China; but, we don’t understand it accurately.</seg>
          <seg id="11">At least 10% of the income of Meta is from China, mainly contributed by companies engaged in sea services.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The office of Meta in Hong Kong accommodates several hundreds of staffs, and it has several major agents in Chinese mainland.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In order to expand overseas markets, Meta is a necessary advertising channel for China, and most expenditure is contributed to Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Interestingly, TT is one of the main competitors of Meta; however, Meta made a lot of money on TT several years ago.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Various agents in China are helping TT put advertisement to Meta, and Meta enjoys favorable performance in Greater China.</seg>
          <seg id="16">I’ve never researched on it lately, but I believe that it will never be better than before.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The stage that Chinese companies burned money in large scale overseas has been finished.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Thirdly, the progress in new flow channel expansion is not as good as expected.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms including TT are not mastered by Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The biggest problem is not only drop in income but also lack of growth expectation.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The capital market settles on not only income but also future expectation.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Obviously, Meta does not have a favorable expectation.</seg>
          <seg id="23">In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells something about the “metaverse”.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Metaverse is actually one of the directions in the future; however, with a long realization period, this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta within the next two or three years.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Therefore, the next two years shall be a tough period for Meta.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Although Facebook is magnificent now, with yearly income of 100 billion to 200 billion USD, in fact, Facebook has very strong sense of crisis; it has no moat when compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although all its social contact software have relatively high daily activity and are mainstream ones, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.; however, when facing with quick development of tiktok, Facebook is not confident enough, and it is a blinking of eye for tiktok to defeat it.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The concept of metaverse has no hope of success within a short period; therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, and this is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and keeps finding a new track; however, I don’t think he has chosen a correct track, but a road of no return; this is my idea for reference.</seg>

          <seg id="2">By consulting relevant domestic and foreign research literature on cervical tuberculosis, the classification, advantages, disadvantages, and prospects of implantations were analyzed and summarized.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The incidence of cervical tuberculosis has increased recently and has a high disability rate.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Currently, the implantation in the surgical treatment of cervical tuberculosis are mainly divided into bone materials, metal materials, and bioactive materials; the above materials have their own advantages and disadvantages, for example, the amount of autologous bone is limited, the complications of allogeneic bone are common, and the bone fusion effect of metal materials is poor.</seg>
          <seg id="5">With the development of science and technology, the implantation are also more diverse.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The choice of the implantation affects the bone fusion directly, furthermore, it affects the effectiveness of cervical tuberculosis, the development of new implantation provides a variety of options for the treatment of cervical tuberculosis.</seg>

The clinical data of 28 patients with high-risk AML treated by cladribine in combination with busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (BuCy) intensified conditioning regimen before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University from October 2016 to June 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The overall survival (OS) rate, cumulative progression-free survival (PFS) rate, relapse rate, non-relapse mortality (NRM), regimen related toxicity (RRT) and risk factors affecting prognosis of the patients were analyzed. The 1-year OS and PFS of the patients after implantation was (78.8±8.6)% and (79.8±8.1)%, while the 1-year cumulative relapse rate and NRM of the patients was 9.3% and 22.0%, respectively.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The 1-year expected OS of MRD&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; high-risk patients before HSCT was 100%. The 1-year expected OS and PFS of the patients in pre-transplant relapse group was (46.9±18.7)% and (50.0±17.7)%, respectively.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The incidence of I/II grade RRT was 39.3%. NO III/IV grade RRT were found in 28 patients.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Multivariate analysis showed that pre-transplant relapse was the independent risk factor affecting OS and PFS of the patients. The intensified conditioning regimen of cladribine in combination with BuCy can reduce the relapse rate of high-risk AML transplantation, and its RRT is mild, exhibiting good safety.</seg>
          <seg id="11">MRD&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; high-risk patients before HSCT can achieve better transplant benefits, but the prognosis of patients with relapse before transplantation is not significantly improved. Therefore, for non-relapsed high-risk AML patients, this intensified conditioning regimen deserves to be considered.</seg>

          <seg id="13">In the study of plaque biomechanics, there are relatively few studies based on fatigue fracture failure theory, and most of them mainly focus on the whole fatigue propagation process from crack initiation to plaque rupture, while there are few studies on the influence of crack on plaque rupture at a certain time in the process of fatigue propagation.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In this paper, a two-dimensional plaque model with crack was established. Based on the theory of fracture mechanics and combined with the finite element numerical simulation method, the stress intensity factor (SIF) and related influencing factors at the crack tip in the plaque were studied. The SIF was used to measure the influence of crack on plaque rupture.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The results show that the existence of crack can lead to local stress concentration, which increases the risk of plaque rupture.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The SIF at the crack tip in the plaque was positively correlated with blood pressure, but negatively correlated with fibrous cap thickness and lipid pool stiffness.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The effect of the thickness and angle of lipid pool on the SIF at the crack tip in the plaque was less than 4%, which could be ignored.</seg>
          <seg id="18">This study provides a theoretical basis for the risk assessment of plaque rupture with cracks.</seg>

          <seg id="24">A consecutive series of 209 prepubertal boys with primary hypospadias repair was included with the age ranged from 10 to 97 months (mean, 31.7 months).</seg>
          <seg id="25">Intraoperative stretched penile length (SPL) was measured before operation ( &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=209), and after each step, namely penile degloving ( &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=152), plate transection ( &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=139), dorsal plication ( &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=170), and fasciocutaneous coverage ( &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=209).</seg>
          <seg id="26">SPLs before and after each steps or the entire operation were analyzed. The SPL was compared between plate transection group and plate preservation group, dorsal plication group and non-plication group, and plate preservation with plication group and plate preservation without plication group, respectively.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Differences of SPL between before and after each steps were analyzed with factors including neourethra length, rest dorsal penile length, rest ventral penile length, preoperative SPL, and the degree of penile curvature after penile degloving, with multivariate linear regression analysis.</seg>
          <seg id="28">In patients with plate transection, postoperative SPL increased when compared with that before operation ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05). No significant difference was noted in patients without plate transection ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05). And there was significant difference in the increased length of SPL between patients with and without plate transection ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05).</seg>
          <seg id="29">In patients with dorsal plication, a significant increase of postoperative SPL ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05) was noted. No significant difference was noted in patients without dorsal plication ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05).</seg>
          <seg id="30">And there was no significant difference in increased length between patients with and without dorsal plication ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05). When patients with plate transection were excluded, dorsal plication resulted in no significant difference on postoperative SPL ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05).</seg>
          <seg id="31">The increased length of SPL after penile degloving, dorsal plication, or cutanofascial coverage was not related to the neourethra length, the rest dorsal penile length, the rest ventral penile length, the preoperative SPL, and the degree of penile curvature ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05). However, the neourethra length and preoperative SPL were the influencing factors for the increased length of SPL after plate transection ( &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05).</seg>
          <seg id="32">The main steps in primary hypospadias repair can change SPL. The lengthening effect of plate transection would not be counteracted by dorsal plication. Dorsal plication makes no significant difference on postoperative SPL.</seg>

          <seg id="39">Case 1 has been treated with Durvalumab until now and case 2 discontinued using of Pembrolizumab.</seg>
          <seg id="40">HLA genotypes and other factors may explain the risk factors of diabetes associated with ICIs in some individuals.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Diabetes mellitus associated with ICIs is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening endocrine system adverse event, which requires doctors to be vigilant.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The patients who use ICIs need to monitor blood glucose. If they have hyperglycemia, endocrinologists should be asked to assist in diagnosis and treatment.</seg>

          <seg id="44">Cattle manure and pig manure were mixed with soils subjected to different reclaimed years (one year, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; 10 years, R&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;; and 30 years, R&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;) at the ratio of manure carbon to soil mass of 4 to 100, so as to examine manure decomposition characteristics using the nylon mesh bag (15 cm deep of soil buried) in the Shanxi coal mine reclamation area, with no manure addition as control (CK).</seg>
          <seg id="45">Soil samples were collected at day 12, 23, 55, 218, 281, and 365 to measure the contents of soil manure residual, soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The contributions of soil properties, manure properties, and hydrothermal condition to manure decomposition were quantified.</seg>
          <seg id="46">The results showed that the decomposition rates of pig manure were significantly higher than cattle manure.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The humification coefficient of pig manure (average 46.3%) was lower than that of cattle manure (average 71.7%). The humification coefficient of pig manure was significantly lower in the 30-year reclaimed soil (44.5%) compared to the 1-year and 10-year reclaimed soil (average 47.2%). There was no significant difference in the humification coefficient of cattle manure among the three reclaimed soils.</seg>
          <seg id="48">The proportion and decomposition rate constant of labile carbon pool of pig manure and cattle manure were significantly different, with values of 52% and 26%, and 0.00085 and 0.00074 ℃&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.</seg>
          <seg id="49">The positive effect of pig manure on MBC and DOC in reclaimed soil was significantly higher than that of cattle manure over 0-218 days, but no difference over 281-365 days.</seg>
          <seg id="50">The magnitude of the enhancement of MBC and DOC in those three reclaimed soils after manure amendments showed a similar trend of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;R&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ R&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;.</seg>
          <seg id="51">Results of variance partitioning analysis showed that manure decomposition was mainly controlled by manure properties (17.9%) when considering soil properties, manure properties, and hydrothermal condition.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In conclusion, the decomposition of pig manure but not cattle manure was regulated by reclamation year.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Cattle manure, with higher humification coefficient than pig manure, was recommended for reclaimed mining area to improve soil fertility.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The conflict between ecological protection and socio-economic development in the old revolutionary base areas along the route of Long March can be addressed by ecological compensation.</seg>
          <seg id="55">In this study, we collected 2018 data of land use, net primary productivity of vegetation, climate factors and so on. The ecosystem service value of 310 counties in the old revolutionary base areas was calculated using the data and modified equivalent factor. Then, the regional differentiated ecological compensation estimation method was applied to estimate the priority and amount of ecological compensation within the area. We further proposed the ecological compensation strategy adopted for the old revolutionary base areas along the route of Long March.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The results showed that the total value of ecosystem services in the old revolutionary base areas along the route of Long March amounted to 2593.74 billion yuan in 2018. Forest services took the highest proportion (58.8%), followed by grassland and waters.</seg>
          <seg id="57">The total amount of ecological compensation made for the old revolutionary base areas along the route of Long March reached 183.405 billion yuan. Compared with this amount, there was a large gap in the actual compensation funds available to the region. In addition, the total amount of ecological compensation accounted for only 0.04% of the aggregate GDP in this area, which put some strain on local fiscal resources and showed certain viability in ecological compensation.</seg>
          <seg id="58">In 2018, totally 100 old revolutionary base areas along the route of Long March were designated as the priority areas for ecological compensation, consistent with the national key eco-function zone policy.</seg>
          <seg id="59">However, there were deviations in the allocation of ecological compensation funds, with some priority areas receiving no compensation.</seg>
          <seg id="60">As for the compensation strategy, it is necessary to put in place a diversified, market-oriented and comprehensive ecological compensation mechanism to increase the sources of ecological compensation funds at first. Then, efforts should be continued to optimize the spatial selection of ecological compensation in the old revolutionary base areas along the route of Long March and to improve the efficiency of regional ecological compensation mechanism.</seg>
          <seg id="61">With the development of ELISA, flow cytometry, quantitative PCR and various omics techniques, the means of immune function evaluation are gradually improved.</seg>
          <seg id="62">The existing definitions of immune function, such as excessive immunity, immunosuppression, immune paralysis and immune tolerance, remain in descriptive concepts and lacks quantitative diagnostic criteria. Clinical manifestations combined with biological indicators will be the most effective quantitative method in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="63">A variety of research concentrating on immunotherapeutic drugs is still in progress, and the success of individualized immunotherapy will depend on accurate immune function evaluation.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In early 2020, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic happened in China.</seg>
          <seg id="65">In the following three months, 42 600 medical personnels and more than 9 000 public health employees were 'rushed out' of their own position and onto Wuhan and other areas in Hubei Province. They helped to strengthen the treatment of severe cases and the isolation of mild cases, and actively carried out community screenings, and eventually won victory in the defense of Wuhan.</seg>
          <seg id="66">During the normalization stage of prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19, China adopted the expanded preventive strategy by focusing on widely implement PCR testing, and integrate general and emergency departments to improve the performance of public health system. In this stage, China put out the cluster of epidemics that have occurred in several places one after another, and effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic in 2 to 3 incubation periods.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In the stage of 'dynamic zeroing', China emphasized the strategy of 'grasping early, grasping the basics', focused on specific measures such as precise prevention in key areas. The rule of golden 24 hours was used to control the spread of the epidemic within one incubation period.</seg>
          <seg id="68">During the epidemic, China continues to adopt active prevention and control strategies. This self-confidence and determination depends on adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the distinct essence of medical and health services, and significant advantages of social governance on health.</seg>

          <seg id="244">The main reasons for the shrinking situation of the service in acupuncture-moxibustion department include: the disease-based department division trends to divert many diseases suitably treated in acupuncture-moxibustion department; the environment pursuing economic benefits restricts the development of acupuncture-moxibustion therapy characterized by 'simple and low-cost operation'.</seg>
          <seg id="245">There are three important approaches for breaking through the dilemma of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy. First, modifying the traditional service mode as waiting for patients in acupuncture-moxibustion department and promoting acupuncture and moxibustion technology to be adopted in other departments rather than limited only in acupuncture-moxibustion department. Second, increasing the charges of acupuncture and moxibustion technology rationally. Third, positioning accurately the role of acupuncture and moxibustion technology in health services based on its own characteristics and advantages and promoting it in community medical institutions.</seg>

          <seg id="247">The role of the brain-gut microbiota axis in functional gastrointestinal diseases has been gradually recognized. According to the ROME IV diagnostic criteria, functional gastrointestinal diseases are classified as diseases caused by abnormal brain-gut interaction. This concept is of great significance to the change of diagnosis and treatment paradigm of functional gastrointestinal diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="248">Chronic constipation is the most common functional gastrointestinal disease. The pathogenesis of chronic constipation is closely related to the imbalance of intestinal flora, the abnormality of enteric nervous system and neurotransmitter in brain.</seg>
          <seg id="249">Therefore, in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation, enough attention should be paid to the concept of integration of brain-gut microflora axis, but the clinical application of brain-gut microflora axis is still limited. This may be one of the factors for high incidence but poor treatment efficacy of chronic constipation.</seg>

          <seg id="252">Based on the existence of the states and the occurrence of the events and their measuring process, we first put forward the concept of 'cumulative number of states in point time'.</seg>
          <seg id="253">Considering the general meaning of 'rate' in mathematics and the units of the elements in indexes, this paper puts forward the concept of 'the change of cumulative number of states in point time', which is equal to the commonly acknowledged concept 'number of incident event within observation period' or 'absolute rate', and further constructs relative rate and proportion.</seg>
          <seg id="254">Proportions can be classified into three types: time-point (or rate-type) constitutional proportion, time-period incidence proportion and their synthesis, time-period constitutional proportion.</seg>
          <seg id="255">The essential difference between relative rate and time-period proportions is whether the observation period is regarded as a one-unit-length fixed period which would be further moved to the description of the indexes. Furthermore, the sources populations of relative rate and proportions are exclusively those at the beginning of the observation period.</seg>
          <seg id="256">Thus, we established a unified identification route about ratios, proportions, and rates, the basic indicators of categorical data in populations.</seg>
          <seg id="257">These are applicable to both fixed and dynamic populations.</seg>
          <seg id="258">The paper aims to clarify the connotation of the indexes and the feasible understanding route and provide some reference for the population researchers.</seg>
