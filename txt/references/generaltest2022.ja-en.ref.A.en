When I tried to buy the entry package, there was a blue package and an orange package.
The orange one is more than double the price.
What's the difference?
I couldn't figure it out by looking it up, so please tell me.
Right now, there should only be blue ones.
If there are any, they may just be old products left over.
They're the same, they just look different.
Karate vs jiu-jitsu
If two fighters were the same height and weight, which would be stronger?
Jiu-jitsu
Practitioners of karate usually only practice against other practitioners of karate
But in jiu-jitsu, especially Brazilian jiu-jitsu, they practice how to dodge hits.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny" Durandal taking out his stress after being dumped by Talia?
Talia and Durandal broke up because they couldn't have children due to a genetic incompatibility,
and I think the idea behind the Destiny Plan was to hold a thorough investigation to find out if the genetics were correct to that extent, so it could have also been him taking out his stress on people.

I never wanna watch TV anymore cause of stuff like that...
I mean, maybe I can't tolerate entertainers anymore? Since TV is all entertainers.
Yesterday I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix and there were tons of scenes where even though they're not saying anything that funny, the staff in the back are cracking up.
I get so uncomfortable with fake laughing like, "This is a popular entertainer so I gotta laugh at everything they say," even when there's clearly nothing funny.
But if the staff don't laugh, it will make the entertainers sulk, which probably makes it suck to work together.
Like an evil corporation from way back, that industry is so much like college athletics, so you probably have to do that to survive because apparently some entertainers' egos are too huge and they just take a bad attitude all the time.
At the same time, there's also always so much arguing like "Don't look down on entertainers," with entertainers themselves exaggerating how hard their jobs are.
I know that until they get popular they barely make any money, but what's with complaining all the time like entertainer's at the very top of the difficult jobs list?
They're just glorifying their own careers and justifying how comedians have too high of a position in the media and in society.
To be honest, my industry has some real crappy parts too, but I feel like people involved in the entertainment world are basically intolerable.
Sorry to complain so much.
It's kinda like a fart that you just have let out cause it's unhealthy to keep inside...

Ikemoto Brush Industry mail order
An assortment of hair brushes!
Sample gifts for purchasers
They randomly replaced the product I ordered in the Tsukumo online shop
TLDR: Ordered a discounted wireless mouse that was cheap, the wired version of that mouse arrived, they said to send it back if I wanted a refund.
This is more an online shopping problem than homebuilt computers, but I'm gonna post here since it's unreasonable no matter what and since it's a famous place.
It started when I saw an MSI wireless gaming mouse on sale for 3,280yen (snapshot at link) in the Tsukumo Day sale that started in the Tsukumo online shop last Friday.
That's the same price as the wired version at the store, so I wondered if it might be a pricing mistake and when I checked the wired version page too, it was 5,071yen (snapshot at link) so I ordered thinking it might not be a mistake
I got the order confirmation email like normal and the shipment email the next day too
Both the messages and the purchase record on my account page had the name listed as "Clutch GM41 Lightweight Wireless"
They didn't contact me about a mistake or a cancel notification from the order through shipment, so at this point I expected that the wireless mouse I ordered would be delivered
The problem was later, when a few hours after shipment I got an email that there was a mistake in the product registration
That email said
*The wireless version at the special sale price was actually the wired version
*The wireless mouse had already shipped so...
1. Refuse to accept it and cancel everything
2. Return the mouse only for a refund
3. Use the wired mouse as-is
So choose from those options
The wired version and wireless versions have different product pages, and the purchase record and the emails and the delivery slip all listed the wireless version, so it seems like they replaced it with the wired version arbitrarily and sent it
Isn't it wild to send a different product from what I ordered without permission, then say "If you want a refund, you send it back"?
Give me advice because even if I accept the refund, I want to strike back somehow
If you were looking for a partner or searching for someone to marry, would you want to avoid dating someone who doesn't get along with their parents?

I don't really care.

Twice Isolated: Typhoons & Heavy Rains wash away sole bridge to district, residents triple stockpiles of food <Fukushima Prefecture, Yamatsuri> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Here's Mr. Matsumoto Yoshiro in Kochihara District, Yamatsuri, Fukushima Prefecture.
A major impact on the lives of eight people between three households was caused by the typhoon that hit eastern Japan in 2019.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "At first you think, 'really?'"
"It makes you think: can it be broken, can it bet swept away so easily?"   The Kochihara Bridge, the only road leading to the Kochihara area, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 11 households and 30 residents of the area in isolation.
The residents, forced to cut off their water supply, continued to use the JR railway bridge which is normally closed to traffic, to carry necessary supplies.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "Normally cars can come straight up to the garden, but now you've got to stop over there, carry or shoulder any belongings, and walk across the railway bridge to get here, which makes you feel thankful for normal transportation and cars in general."    An emergency bridge was completed a month after the event, but within just three months it was washed away by heavy rains and the area was again isolated for several days until a temporary bridge could be built.
It's been a little over 2 years since the disaster and restoration efforts have progressed, Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on lessons learned.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "I think we have about 10 cases.
I thought, first of all, I'd like to secure about 2~3 days worth" of canned foods, instant noodles and other foods than can be used as emergency rations, and ended up having about 3 times the amount stocked compared to before the disaster.
Matsumoto Misako: "I was reminded that it's not just other people's concern and you never know when a disaster might strike, so it's a good idea to have a little stockpile."   On the other hand, Yamatsuri experienced an "unexpected disaster" when the local bridge was washed away.
In order to not forget the lesson, the town started its own unique initiative from 2021.
Takahashi Ryuichi, Director, Education Division, Yamatsuri: "An announcement has been made that October 12 will be called 'Yamatsuri Disaster Prevention Day', a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onward.
I think that we are more aware now than ever before that the unexpected can occur."

Do you think Hanyu's ranking would have changed if the Olympics hadn't been in China?
No.
You can't say that there was a hole in the ice, or that he got injured, because it was in China.
There are very specific regulations for Olympic rinks, even down to the lighting.
This is to make conditions the same wherever you are.
Therefore, it would have been the same wherever it was held.

Experiencing the Paralympic Marathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo!News
An event was held in Tokyo on December 12th, 2021, that allowed participants to run a digitally recreated version of the Paralympic marathon course.
The aim of the event was to allow people to enjoy sports in a new way and experience Tokyo's superb sightseeing spots through digital means.
The venue was equipped with running machines and exercise bikes, and visitors donned special equipment to run along the Paralympic marathon course recreated in virtual space.
Tablets displaying the virtual environment also showed participants their own avatar, and the VR experience was set up to allow visitors - both from Japan and overseas - to compete against each other in the marathon, and also take in the sights.
One participant commented that, "The scenery changed a lot, and it was really fun."
They added, "Running through the streets of Tokyo like this was pretty tough, but also enjoyable at the same time, and the competitive element allowed me to keep going to the end." A spokesperson for the city stated that they hoped to make the experience available for people to enjoy in gyms and other places as well, with a view to introducing it early next year.

Since updating to AE.
Since I updated to AE, these sounds don't work in a completely vanilla environment
- The weapon swinging sound
- The weapons clashing sound
- The voice when swinging a weapon
- BGM
I think it's sounds cued by player decisions that aren't working cause the slashing sound when an attack hits an enemy, the sound of drawing a sword when you change weapons, and magic sounds are all playing normally.
It's a completely clean vanilla environment, so I wanna know if anyone else has seen a bug like this or has any hints.

Or is my tongue just delicate?

If you let this slide over your tongue, it may cut it and make it bleed.

[Compatible with Normal Version / SSE: Skyrim Special Edition] Real voiceroid? xVASynth 2 software that does voice synthesis with data from Skyrim and other games
xVASynth 2 is an amazing piece of software made with mysterious technology that can synthesize character voice audio from various games, mostly Bethesda and BioWare.
It's less a mod and more something to make mods? It has lotsa functions, and it can do not only text-to-speech, where it reads words out loud, but also speech-to-speech, where you record your own lines and change it to the character's voice.
If it's precise enough, you can skip pronunciation inflection, which is convenient.
xVADict TES Edition has a dictionary file with pronunciations set for special words (like n'wah and Kvatch) from a game called Elder Scrolls.
It can even do "The l'Cie of the fal'Cie of Pulse is in Cocoon on Purge."
It's a tool that can convert .lip (lipsync) and .fuz (audio) so you can use audio created in the .lip/.fuz plugin xVASynth 2 in games.
With this you could probably make a gameplay video of M'aiq and Nazeem for real.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Appraisal System?" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
●New "Building Condition Appraisal System" established amidst revitalization of used house market 　Used home market booming.
Prices for both houses and apartments are rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.
While the COVID situation has caused an increase in preference towards homeownership, there's a rise in popularity of properties listed as "station-front, near station, directly connected to station," "large scale," and "tower". The overall number of new properties that are relatively inexpensive has plummeted, and that surely plays a role as well.
(View images in this article) However, in comparison to markets abroad, Japan's share of used-housing is still quite low.
And so in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the laws surrounding building lots and building transactions while initiating a variety of living condition inspections for the purpose of safe and secure transactions surrounding used homes. （https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ）
This is a system where an architect experienced with housing checks the current condition of the building and property, looking at things such as the level of deterioration, and compiles a report which is then presented to the buyer.
The MLIT explains that the introduction of inspections will mutually benefit buyers and sellers.
That's because by conducting proper inspections beforehand, sellers can avoid post-sale complaints while providing buyers with peace of mind.
In turn, this will help to differentiate between competitors.
It's also explained that on the other hand, the system allows the buyer to have a grasp of the condition of the house they're purchasing and allow them to make a purchase with a fuller understanding, which, at first glance, seems to be a big pro.
However, under the current system, it's primarily the seller who has control regarding these building condition surveys.
Additionally, it should be noted that only a notification of the availability of the inspection is obligatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of brokering is obligated to explain whether they can refer an architect to conduct a building condition survey or not, but the implementation of the inspection itself is not obligatory.
● Risk of Seller-Driven Inspections causing concerns.    Overseas, similar systems already implemented in U.S., U.K., and other countries where the used home market is booming.
There's a system in which during the preliminary stages of a home sale or purchase, the buyer requests a survey of the building by a specialist, such as an "inspector" or "building surveyor."
In the United States, for example, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of used home sales, depending on the state.
The nature of the inspection process differs greatly from the "seller"-oriented Japanese style inspections because the "buyer" is responsible for conducting the inspection.
The sellers attempt to make the building look as good as possible and sell it as quickly and for as high a price as possible.
In comparison, the buyers want to examine the results of the survey and make necessary repairs to ensure a safe and comfortable living environment.
Even if the inspection in itself is the same, there is a discrepancy in the objectives and thoughts of both parties.
Due to this, the following points have been raised as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
●The scope of the seller-initiated inspections set by the government stops at the bare minimum.
Since the survey isn't detailed, there is a risk of overlooking truly important issues ●For an inspection company, the brokerage firm (seller) that introduces the project to the company in charge can also be considered to be a customer.
Thus, there's a chance that "cover-up" inspections may take place where unfavorable information is not reported to the seller.

It was pretty rough.
But I was cured (?) mentally, so I was fully motivated.
My body couldn't keep up and I was falling asleep at work because I was a researcher.
During my 1st year it was my 2nd time and I took it lightly, thinking I'd take a month off and say goodbye to my shitty company, but it turned out to be more serious than I thought, and the medication didn't seem to work, so I was sick longer than I'd expected.
Anyway, it's important to see a psychiatrist to make sure it's handled correctly and to keep a history of visits (this is very important)
As long as you have a history of hospital visits, even if you left the company of your own accord, at HelloWork you can change your reason of resignation to company reasons by doctor's decision, so it's way easier to get unemployment insurance etc.
Even if you can't find a job or just want to take a break for a while, you'll have plenty of wiggle room emotionally and financially.

Ginza Used to be an Island?
Five Interesting Facts to Show Off With When You Take a Stroll Around Ginza (LEON.JP) - Yahoo!News
"This place used to be a peninsula, you know.
You can see the evidence of it... " Ginza offers the unique opportunity to show off a little knowledge.
Today, I'm going to share a few interesting tidbits of trivia about Ginza that you will surely want to share with others.
A Place That Surpasses Ginza?!
First Visit to Kinza
As you walk through Ginza, you'll notice strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, a plethora of shrines, and other traces of its history etched into the land.
When strolling around Ginza with your girlfriend, during a lull in the conversation you can whip out a fact like, "This place used to be a peninsula, you know."
Ginza Used to be a Peninsula?
Ginza is a famous shopping district in Chuo-ku, Tokyo that has inspired many imitations across Japan, naming themselves "Somewhere-or-other Ginza".
The name "Ginza" originally refers to a silver coin mint, since this is where the silver mint was relocated from present-day Shizuoka in 1612 (Keicho 17).
At the time, it was known as "Shin-Ryogae-cho", but when it relocated to Kakigara-cho, it became commonly referred to as "Ginza".
And the area around Ginza was once a peninsula that protruded into the sea.
Long before the Edo period, there used to be an inlet stretching from Hibiya to Marunouchi, effectively creating a peninsula known as "Edomae-jima" that stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula was where Ginza stands today.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate government in Edo, he filled in the inlet and began to develop the area around Kyobashi.
In addition, Ieyasu constructed a grid system, and waterways for transportation by boat.
The soil and rubble from Kandayama, which was levelled, and excavated for the waterways were used to fill in the inlet.
Today, a stone monument stands out in front of the Tiffany & Co. Ginza flagship store (Ginza 2-7, Chuo-ku) that marks the site of the Ginza silver mint, Ginza's origin, so why not seek it out for yourself.
An Obscure Pilgrimage in Ginza
A little-known pilgrimage known as the Ginza Haccho Shrine Pilgrimage is held annually in Ginza.
Of the ten shrines to visit on the pilgrimage, the most prominent is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki theatre.
Located on the right side of Kabukiza Theatre, many people stop by this shrine before or after seeing a play.
Meanwhile, Ryuko Fudoson Shrine is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and Ginza Shusse Jizoson Shrine is located on Ginza Terrace, on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
Hodo Inari Shrine, Azuma Inari Shrine and Toyoiwa Inari Shrine are a little harder to find as they are hidden down back alleys, but Toyoiwa Inari Shrine in particular is well known for being revered by legendary Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon. Seiko Inari Shrine, in the ground floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building, is only open to the public during the Ginza Haccho Shrine Pilgrimage.
This tour of the shrines also takes in shrines that worship Acala and Ksitigarbha, but most of the shrines are dedicated to Inari.
Inari shrines have a fox statue in front of the main building, and were built in farming regions as they were believed to bring a bumper rice harvest.
In large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, people came to think that Inari shrines benefitted business prosperity, and this belief also propagated in Japan's finest shopping district, Ginza.
What do you think of people who returned home without getting the vaccine?
I don't think it's a good thing.
Because there have been many cases of people being infected with the Omicron variant even after two vaccinations.
I'd have to say their actions are careless.

I went to the dentist because of a sharp pain, like hypersensitivity, in my front tooth that I feel when touching or pushing on it.
The nerve was removed and the hole is still there.
They said it was to quickly stop the pain.
When I touch my tooth, the pain is even more intense than before the treatment, will it really heal within a few days?
Even the painkillers don't work at all.
It'll get better after a few days.
I think it hurts the most now.
Take care.
It's the end of the 3rd day of the New Year.

- The retro game superplay video I made at the end of the year and uploaded on New Year's Day has been played 5 whole times (decent for the industry).

Body of a Man Discovered in the Shonai-gawa River, Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV News) - Yahoo!News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found dead, lying face-down in the Shonai-gawa River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya.
Police are currently trying to identify the man, and determine the cause of death.
According to the police, the man was found lying face-down in the Shonai-gawa River by a passerby just before 11:30am on the 12th, and they promptly called 110.
The man was pulled out from the river, but was confirmed dead at the scene.
Police are hurrying to identify the man, and also looking into the cause of death.
Similarly, the body of a man around 70 was discovered in the Suna-gawa River in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki, who was confirmed dead.
The man's clothes showed no signs of a struggle, but there was a bike lying nearby.
Police are hurrying to identify the man, and are investigating the circumstances of the man's death.
The mid-February benefit payment for households exempt from residential tax will be paid if one person in the household is exempt from taxation?
Looks like the confirmation documents are being sent out from today.
It has to be everyone.
That's too bad.
Korean POSCO International Acquires Australian Senex Energy, Looking to Expand Its Gas Field Operations Overseas (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo!News
POSCO International revealed on the 12th that it has made a stock purchase agreement with Australian energy firm, Senex Energy, and an investment contract with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
The acquisition is expected to be concluded in March next year, although the approval of shareholders at Senex Energy's AGM and of local subsidiaries is still required.
This acquisition will be one of the largest global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) since POSCO International merged with the POSCO Group in 2010.
The cost of the acquisition is 770.9 billion won, with POSCO International investing 50.1%, and Hancock Energy investing 49.9% of the amount.
POSCO International explained the reasoning behind this move, pointing to the fact that demand for natural gas is continuing to increase even as people are seeking alternative energy sources, and that in the future, they believe the hydrogen fuel market will predominantly be made up of green hydrogen and natural gas-based blue hydrogen.
POSCO's acquisition will secure 802 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, which is 44% of Korea's natural gas consumption for 2019, as well as the personnel to operate the onshore gas fields in Australia.

Don't you think there are a little too many public holidays?
Originally in February there was just National Foundation Day on the 11th, but now the 23rd is also a national holiday because the current emperor was born in February.
However, the previous emperor's birthday on December 23rd has been made into an ordinary day of the week, so the number of national holidays in a year remains the same.
Could That Knee Pain be Gonarthrosis?!
Treatments Differ Depending on the Underlying Cause (Medical DOC) -Yahoo!News
Editor: Recently, my knee has been hurting.
What condition could be causing this?
Dr Maruyama: Knee pain can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and so on.
Osteoarthritis is quite a common affliction among Japanese people.
Editor: Is that a condition where the joint becomes deformed?
Dr Maruyama: That's right.
A healthy joint is surrounded by cartilage, which absorbs impacts and helps the joint to move smoothly.
However, a person's age, weight, or any strenuous activities - such as sports - that they do can cause the cartilage to wear away or become deformed.
As a result, joints can become deformed and inflammation can occur.
Editor: Can osteoarthritis manifest anywhere other than the knees?
Dr Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, osteoarthritis can affect the joints of fingers, neck, lower back, big toes and hips.
However, it occurs most commonly in the knee, in which case it is called "gonarthrosis".
Editor: What is the structure of a joint anyway?
Dr Maruyama: A joint is where two bones fit together, one in the other.
The ends of bones, where they face each other, are covered with what's known as "articular cartilage", and then the whole joint is enveloped by a "joint capsule".
Editor: It sounds like quite a complicated structure.
Dr Maruyama: Yes.
The inside of the joint capsule is lined with the synovial membrane, which secretes synovial fluid.
Synovial fluid contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate, and acts as a lubricant.
This is why people say that it's good to take these as supplements for your knee joints.
Editor: What are the symptoms of gonarthrosis?
Dr Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic, and it prevents the bones from bumping into each other.
In other words, it acts as a cushion.
However, if it wears away or becomes deformed, the joint can become deformed and inflammation can occur, causing pain.
Do you wear pyjamas when you go to bed?
I normally wear pyjamas, but if they're in the wash, then I'll sleep in sweats or something!
Can some heavy smokers quit smoking, while others can't?
Yeah, there are two types.
I knew a heavy smoker, but they stopped altogether.
They thought about trying to quit somehow, and then just quit.

More Excitement Than You Can Handle...!
3 Types of Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The "Kaiji" series is a gambling themed manga series that boasts explosive popularity particularly among men.
One of the most thrilling aspects of this work is an extreme game where your life is on the line.
[Picture] Just looking makes your legs clench up... Taking on the steel beam walk!
Therefore, we'd like to test the Kaiji games that can actually be played, or look at them being played in videos.
■Numa : A pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Rebellion Kaiji".
In the manga, it surprised Kaiji with its expensive rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had 3 large traps: a "forest of nails," a "movable accessory," and a "three-tiered cloon," and was considered almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used all sorts of tricks, and in the end, he successfully clears the swamp by placing a vinyl water tank on a building and causing the ground to sink and tilt.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji was made into a real pachinko game, and a number of people play it.
Of course there is no "4000 yen per ball" gimmick, and the difficulty has been turned down, but you can experience Kaiji's feelings yourself.
■Steel Beam Crossing : A wealthy man held a "star side party" as a form of entertainment and had the debtors, including Kaiji, perform a "human horse race".
Debtors compete to see how fast they can advance atop a thin steel beam 10 meters above the ground, devising ways to avoid falling off.
There are 12 participants, and the top 2 get the prize money, but there are only four steel frames, inadequate safety measures, and a very high chance of death.
While this game is very dangerous, it was developed as a VR game and can also be experienced extremely closely to the original at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge has a single steel beam bridge coming out at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the seventh floor of a building), and at the end there is a "sky swing" and a "victory bridge" prepared, which you walk to.
Naturally, safety measures are in place.
Comedian "Koala Koarashi" went viral when he released a video on his YouTube channel showing him walking across the Eagle Bridge, showing that people could experience the steel beam crossing in Japan.
■E Card : a card game designed for 2 players.
The game has two sides, the emperor's side and the slave's side, and uses a total of 10 cards: one emperor's card, eight citizen's cards, and one slave's card.
The game is very well designed, with the characteristics that the emperor beats the citizens, the citizens beat the slave, and the slave beats the emperor.
In the story, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, his ear will be cut off.
After realizing that his mind was being read by an ear destroying, earphone-like device attached to his ear that detects and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, Kaiji confounded Tonegawa by cutting off his own ear to the utmost limit and sending his body readings of the chart, allowing him to win.
E Cards are commercially available and can be purchased on platforms such as Amazon.
The popular YouTuber Hikaru went viral when he uploaded a video of him playing E Cards with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played Kaiji in the movie.
■Perhaps you could try getting a taste of Kaiji's feelings?
No one wants to be in situations like Kaiji, but it is true that reading the manga makes you curious about his experiences.
How about trying out Kaiji's world through games?
The First Step and a Gentle Push toward the New Year, a Large Ema of a Tiger at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine｜Yamagata Shimbun
Among preparations for the New Year, a large ema depicting the Chinese zodiac sign for the coming year, the "Tiger," has arrived on display at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City).
The designers, students of Tohoku University of Art and Design, visited the shrine on November 11, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
Since two years prior, the shrine has commissioned University of Art and Design students to create the original drawings for the ema.
The work of the third-year student Tsuchiya Yui, 22, was selected from among nine students in the Japanese Painting course of the art department under the direction of Professor Suenaga Toshiaki.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide, and about 1.8 meters tall in the middle.
Tsuchiya said she made her painting with the image of "cherry blossoms gently pushing one's back as they step into the new year."
The image of the tiger standing still and gazing at the cherry blossoms was created with the hope that people will have time to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world.
Tsuchiya's design is also used on the ema for public distribution.
"I think it will serve to help everyone with overcoming difficulties," said Chiba Kenichi, 44, a Gonnegi (junior priest).

Considering What Makes Tamano a Great Place to Live in and Proposing Improvements at a Workshop Involving Students from 4 High Schools: Sanyo Newspaper Digital | San-digi
What kind of place will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano have been engaged in a joint workshop considering what makes Tamano a great place to live in, and the changes they'd like to see made.
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Future Planning Centre, an intermediary support organisation, young people are being given the chance to share their views, and their opinions will be relayed to the mayor.
The students were asked what they find fun.
Responses to the facilitator's question included answers such as, "When having a good time with lots of people," and "when playing the drums."
The first workshop session was held on November 13th at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
Eighteen high school students got together with local residents and had discussions using the world café method: moving between "islands" that each had a set topic for discussion such as "interesting city", "livable city" and "rewarding city".
The participants wrote their thoughts down on post-it notes and organised them by sticking them on large sheets of paper.
"A city with lots of young people would be good," and "Good public transport - such as trains and buses - is essential for the livability of the city," were some of the comments.
The participants then discussed these points further to see if they had anything in common.
"I used to think that Tamono was boring, but being able to cycle along the seafront is one of the city's charms," said a third-year student (18) from Tamano Commercial and Technical High School.
A third-year student (18) from Binan High School said, "There aren't many shops and public transport is inconvenient, but it's nice being surrounded by nature," and so through dialogue with the adults, the students seemed to realise not only the issues of the area, but also its charms.
The second workshop in December was just for the high school students, during which they wrote up their proposals.
In February of next year, the students will present their proposals to the mayor, head of the board of education and other invited figures.
Higashi Rie, chairwoman of the Tamano SDGs Future Planning Centre, said of the workshops, "As well as fostering a love of one's hometown among the high school students, the workshops aim to inspire young people to be actively involved in town planning."

Find Your Own Fab Grown-up Look: A New Way to Wear a Shawl (The Sankei News) - Yahoo!News
A shawl is an indispensable item in winter, but do you ever find they hang lopsided around your neck?
Maybe you try to adjust it in front of the mirror, but I often hear from women that they simply don't know the secret to wearing one.
Wondering if there was a shawl that was easy to put on, and didn't become unbalanced, I found something novel.
This shawl from the brand, COTTORI, is about 1m long on its longest side, and so is distinctly petite compared to its regular counterparts.
When I first saw it, I wondered whether it would even be possible to put on something so short.
But, on closer inspection, the whole thing is made of individual strips of narrow cloth woven together to form a single, mesh-like construction.
The ends of the shawl can be inserted into the eyes of the mesh.
This means you can wrap the shawl around you and fasten it in place without needing to tie the ends.
It is made from a very light and warm fleece material.
Sleeveless gilets are all the rage this year, but many people combine them with a shawl to keep their shoulders warm.
A shawl like this one would surely come in handy here.

The Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is really interesting
It's called "Get Back" and it's directed by Peter Jackson
There's a lot of fresh stuff, and it feels vivid, like the true-to-life Beatles......
It's just before the breakup so there's tension, but not the kind of dramatic tension I'd imagined
It's Paul trying to take control and meddling while being all "I know how annoying I am, okay!," and George all peevish like "But come on!" and John unexpectedly calmly giving opinions and telling jokes while always showing up late and seeming unmotivated... and Ringo being a mediator, not really butting in actively but in the back making a "Yuh-oh" kinda face
Like, it's not like they hate each other enough to fight, but there's a real strong "Well, it's probably impossible to work together at this point" vibe, and it's so interesting that even the Beatles felt like that. It's like dismantling a legend or something
And even in that atmosphere, once they start to perform, the talent really comes pouring out
The progress from just a little phrase to asking one another "What about this?" to developing into such famous songs is wild
Especially the moment they develop "Get Back," from the title
It's amazing that there's a recording of the scene of how this casual humming like "mm-hmm mm-mhm" turns bit by bit into that "jugga ♪ jugga ♪" and then the lyrics come in
It's awesome cause you never get to see a song being created like this
And this is obvious, but everybody hits their stride, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy
I guess it's still only part one of three, but at this point my impression is that the biggest cause of the breakup wasn't the Beatles themselves so much as the surrounding environment
With the four of them, even while they're complaining, when they start to make music it somehow looks fun, but when the conversation turns to where to play their concert, then the producer and a publicity-type person start talking all this "Well, since The Beatles are the best in the world!" stuff, and it's easy to see how it was out of their hands at that point
I mean, documentaries are subject to the director's interpretation so it might be that it was just how Peter Jackson felt
Also it seems that Paul was supervising so I guess that's maybe why there were so many scenes where he came off as sort of the bad guy.

In terms of "Demon Slayer", about how strong would Guts from "Berserk" be?
Could he become a hashira?
He couldn't.
If he doesn't call out the name of his techniques before using them.
I thought since they have a serious personality, they must be feeling a sense of responsibility taking it hard.
I think it's a bit tough to live right now.
I started out in sales, but I changed jobs after getting so sick I nearly died, and at that time, I wasn't good at making sales on my own, but I thought I was very suited to sales where customers needed me, so I chose such a job in a different industry and found it much easier to work.
You talked about what you couldn't do, but if you can find something you are even slightly good at, I think it will make your future life a little easier.
←Of course, you should consider this after you've relaxed and have some peace of mind.
However, since you've got to deal with daily life too, it would be a good idea to consult with someone at the company union, a company doctor, or a consultation service if there is one available as sometimes there can be some kind of system in place.
I hope you'll be able to live life more comfortably moving forward.

US Ravaged by Multiple Tornadoes; The Effects of Unseasonable Warmth and a Bitter Cold Snap (Weather News) - Yahoo!News
Multiple tornadoes occurred in southern US states from the evening of Friday the 10th, through to the next day (local time).
It's thought that this was the result of locations with record temperatures for the season being hit by a sudden cold snap from the north, making atmospheric conditions unstable and causing the sudden formation of cumulonimbus clouds.
Southern states had been enjoying record temperatures thanks to warm south-westerlies.
In Houston, Texas, temperatures had risen to nearly 30°C on the 9th and 10th (local time).
During this record warm spell, cold air below -30°C blew in from the north at an altitude of 5,500m, and the large temperature difference created a severe cold front, causing the sudden formation of cumulonimbus clouds.
Multiple tornadoes struck the area.
While tornadoes are not uncommon in the southern states, the peak season for their occurrence is from the early summer onwards, and there are not many examples of major damage from tornadoes in this season.
Almost 150 tornado warnings were issued in one day, a record amount for winter.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had over 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts on Friday the 10th (local time) alone.
From the reports, it was ascertained that there were two main concentrations of tornadoes: a southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and a northern line that included Illinois.
In Kentucky, tornadoes were measured as EF3, the 3rd strongest level on the 6-level EF scale (Enhanced Fujita scale) that is used to measure the strength of tornadoes based on the damage they cause, and gusts of around 70m/s were also recorded.
Further investigation may even reveal the damage to be EF4-5.
The JEF scale is used in Japan; it is based on the EF scale, but adjusted to suit Japanese buildings.
JEF3 tornadoes, equivalent to the tornadoes that have just hit America, could easily occur in Japan, and would have the strength to level wooden houses.

Should I fold the paper bag that they put it in at the shrine and put them in my wallet together?

Calling for Help on a Live Stream Buried Under Rubble After One of the Worst Tornadoes in US History (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo!News
With a grave expression on his face, US president Joe Biden expressed the view on the 11th (the 12th, Japan time) that the devastating tornado that swept through the south and midwest of the country was "one of the biggest tornadoes in US history".
CNN and other US news outlets covered his speech.
President Biden stressed that he would do everything in his power as the head of the federal government.
He went on to explain that the full extent of the damage was still unknown, including the number of lives lost.
However, more than 100 people are feared dead.
[Photo] Residents in tornado-ravaged Kentucky retrieving their belongings from their levelled house. Over 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, from the evening of the 10th through to the early hours of the 11th.
A trail of damage extending 219 miles (approximately 350KM) was recorded in Missouri in 1925, but meteorologists at CNN believe the scale this time could be close to 250 miles (approximately 400KM), making it the largest on record.
Massive damage was caused to a candle factory in Mayfield, Kentucky, which had been operating 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas.
110 people were working there at the time, but the building was razed to the ground, leaving no trace.
In the darkness, trapped and immobile under rubble about 1.5m deep, a woman could feel the weight of rescuers searching overhead, and, using Facebook Live on her phone, she called for help on a live stream.
Aside from the woman calling for help, screams, and another woman crying and singing "Happy Birthday" to herself in an attempt to calm and distract herself from the reality of the situation, could also be heard on the stream.
Amber Brown, a convenience store employee who lives in Mayfield, was safe after taking refuge in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son after hearing the tornado alert.
"Lots of people say a tornado sounds like a train, but it was a terrifying sound, like something spurting out of the ground," she recalls.
A Mayfield police officer said, "We will continue to search for as long as necessary.
I don't know if that will be weeks, or months, or years," before returning to rescue operations in earnest.
In Illinois, a warehouse belonging to the online retail giant Amazon partially collapsed, killing at least six people.
A train was derailed by the tornado with such force that its carriages became uncoupled, and cars lie overturned on the freeway, causing many disruptions to transport.
According to online media outlets in the US, around 400,000 homes have been left without power, with 130,000 of those located in Tennessee.

Sounds tough if you can't get welfare...
I hope you can manage somehow
If you had a live-in job like a Japanese inn or part-time resort work, you could get a residence AND an income, but there aren't many options with the COVID social situation right now.
Did some googling and found this site↓
Live-In Part-Time Jobs/Full Employment: Live-In Recruitment Navigator (SumiNavi)
The related searches were "irregular circumstances, live-in, work," so your coworkers would probably mostly be people like that
For a bank account and line contracts, you could probably manage if you had an address just at first, but for credit cards (and debit cards that work like credit cards), you won't be able to renew with no address (since they send the new card to your registered address).
What does it mean to be a resident in gynaecology?
A "resident" is a doctor in their 3rd to 5th year of practice after graduation.
They are also sometimes called "specialists" or "senior residents".
The term "intern" is applied to "junior residents", which refers to doctors in their 1st and 2nd years after graduation.
Although you could say they still lack experience, in the 4th and 5th years, residents become able to administer some medical care, and are entrusted with various cases.

It's said that there have been different attitudes toward the star based rating system for a long time.
The argument is that while other countries use 5 stars as a standard from which points are deducted, Japan uses 3 stars as a base and adds/drops points.
There's already a difference of two stars at the starting point, and four stars has a completely different meaning between "points have been deducted" and "not a masterpiece but an honorable mention".
If we use 5 stars as a standard, then "a work that is simply flawless" and "a work that is of the highest standard in everything" would be in the same category, and I think that would be a flaw in the system that doesn't accurately communicate the meaning of the stars, but that is how the system is operated so they say they don't want to be given 3 stars (a bad rating).
So if you try to argue with people who insist on this kind of discourse with the 2 option style of Steam ratings, you'll never be on the same page.

Is there an underwater pump that can be powered by USB, to which you can attach a standard size hose?
The output capacity of a USB power supply is 5V and goes up to about 2A, giving you only 10W of power.
With an underwater pump, it depends on the model, they consume at least 500W, so that wouldn't really be possible at all.

When I made my own radio
I made an AM radio with a homemade condenser and coil but there was so much noise that I couldn't really hear.
FWIW, I could hear the sound of the radio but it was a different station than the frequency it was tuned to.
Maybe the tuning was sloppy so I couldn't hear well but it was a different broadcaster than I wanted...
The real question is, I wanted to make an AM radio but I think what I heard was FM radio.
Why do you think that is? Does that kinda thing happen?

Thanks for your post.

Saga Food Report: Hakobune's Locally Caught Seasonal Fried Shrimp and Fish with Homemade Tartar Sauce | Life and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Locally Caught Seasonal Fried Shrimp and Fish with Homemade Tartar Sauce Bento
Hakobune is a takeout that specialises in colourful bentos and deli items made with plenty of vegetables.
Husband and wife team Kagetsu Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the store last August in the hopes of giving people a restaurant dining experience at home.
One of the most popular menu items is the locally caught seasonal fried shrimp and fish with homemade tartar sauce bento (1,000 yen).
The best seasonal fish are selected at the market.
According to Takayuki, they only lightly coat the shrimp and fish in untoasted bread crumbs so that one can appreciate the seafood's texture, and this is nowhere more evident than in the plump fried shrimp.
Their bento boxes also contain vegetables and around four deli items, and come with soup and semi-brown Hinohikari rice from Saga with mixed grains.
The vegetables are either homegrown in the adjacent vegetable plot, or purchased at farmers' markets around the prefecture.
Side dishes change with the seasons, and as Takayuki has trained in French cooking, his carrot salad and ratatouille lend colour to the dishes.
Meanwhile, "comforting, familiar flavours" (Yumi) in dishes like egg rolls seasoned with dashi stock, and other fusions of Japanese and western cuisine are enjoyed by people of all ages.
Another popular bento is the hand-formed Hamburg steak made with 100% Japanese ground pork and beef (1,000 yen).
Next year, they will also be launching a charcuterie set, featuring various meaty delicacies that make a perfect wine match.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and saw something that looked interesting, so I tried it
Comfort   It's not that bad but it does shake (not enough to make you sick)
Speed   slow of course
Safety   I think it's mostly safe because it slowed down when there were people around and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it was dangerous in some places
People looking   It sucked, being looked at in itself was fine, but when they look at me like "you're in my way", it hurt my heart
Overall   it wasn't bad but it has room for improvement.
It's too bad that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they were asked to move further to the side.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create a dedicated lane or something so as not to get in the way of other people walking around
However, I thought it would be a better ride if it were a little less crowded because it was relaxing and I could take my time and enjoy the scenery
It's a difficult ride to enjoy unless you're very patient and get excitement from the sense of that in the near future this kind of automatic ride will be mainstream, and enjoy the embarassment of being looked at
It was fucking embarrassing

If you look very carefully, you may be able to tell, but this is a fake eel bowl that doesn't use any eel.
Actually, it's eggplant! (if you tap the answer will show)
I like eel, but I was thinking that people mostly just eat the sauce and the eel part is not really important except for the grilling... then I realized that the texture and quantity of the eel is quite important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, I just want to eat them.
The recipe I used: EGGPLANT "EEL" - Woks of Life (instead of green onion I used Japanese pepper
) I just steamed it and then cooked it in a pan with sauce, but it lowkey took about 30 minutes.
I'm twenty.

I don't cough unless I make myself.
It's not bad after waking up, I feel it more in the evening and night.
Is it COVID-19?
Seems like it may be an allergy.
Mental illness really sucks
Work isn't going well.
Was considering a temporary retirement from around October and have been postponing it from a half-baked sense of responsibility, but I've finally reached the limit.
Also thinking about leaving my job or the IT field.
But I wouldn't know how to make a living in the future.
I've worked part-time at a supermarket, but I couldn't even do that kind of job (so I've been doing part-time engineering work).
Are there any LLLers with experience with temporary retirement or quitting due to illness?
I think the new Roadster will be the NE, does it mean E=EV?
It's just going in alphabetical order, but there is a possibility that they make it EV to make use of the E.
Then I guess they'd call it Ne.

When I change html to php extension, it doesn't display.
The source is vi on Linux.
Why does this happen?
It's obvious.
It's not a problem with the extension, it's because the languages are different.
The page is written in html language (XHTML), so it is of course meaningless to change only the extension to PHP.
If you write the site source with PHP language, and save it as php, it'll be ok.

Man Left Slashed as His Attacker Escapes on a Motorbike During an Attempted Murder in Otakara, Saga on the 12th |  Incidents and Accidents | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25am on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka prefecture was attacked with a knife in the street in Otakara 1-chome, Saga, by a man in his 30s to 40s, resulting in an injury to his face.
His assailant escaped on a motorbike, and the South Saga Police Department is now attempting to find the man in connection with attempted murder.
According to police, a passerby rang 110, saying there was a "fight occurring."
The victim sustained a cut across his left cheek about 10cm long and 1cm deep, but was said to be conscious.
His assailant was described as being of medium build and having a shaved head.
A blade was found near the crime scene that is thought to have been used in the attack.
The victim is said to have been drinking with several acquaintances, and police are looking into reports that there was an altercation between him and the man on the bike regarding the use of the road.

One Family's Long Journey to Establish Conservation Efforts in Remote Regions of China (JBpress) - Yahoo!News
(Kato Yuki: consultant for Hong Kong company, Find Asia Limited) Spanning over a vast area, China is important in terms of biodiversity, since it plays home to the largest number of mammal species in the world, and the third-largest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognise the value of this biodiversity and not only undertake their own conservation efforts, but also promote the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna, located in southwestern China, is one place.
Xishuangbanna borders Laos and Myanmar, and many ethnic groups live there, including the Dai people, who share their roots with the people of Thailand.
The Mekong River, which runs through a number of countries in southeast Asia, has its source here.
Xishuangbanna accounts for only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but around 25% of China's wildlife species and 20% of its plant species call this area home.
I met up with Minguo Li in Xishuangbanna, where she plays a role in conservation, and spoke to her about her activities.
■ Minguo Li started conservation activities with her German husband, and together they have been working hard in this endeavour for the past 20 years.
What made you want to get involved in conservationism?
Minguo Li: We started our conservation venture under the moniker "TianZi " in 2000.
The inspiration came from my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is originally from Germany, and came to Xishuangbanna on a joint scientific project conducted by China and the UN.
It was the only tropical rainforest in China, and was a veritable hotspot for biodiversity.
However, economic development in the region had fallen behind.
Consequently, to try and establish an industry here, vast swathes of the rainforest were cut down to harvest rubber, a commodity that was in short supply in China.
My husband was posted here from Germany to restore natural resources and to carry out bioprospecting.
That's when we met, when I was working as a reporter here, and then we got married.
Were you interested in nature conservation before that?
Minguo Li: Although I'm from Xishuangbanna, I'd never considered how important the rainforest is, or how extraordinary the biodiversity.
So, I entered into the project with my husband with no prior knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who are neither especially tall, nor do they have refined features, but they give off an incredible aura; why do you think that is?
A famous actor talked about this.
They said that an aura is not something that you can choose to give off.
It's something that naturally materialises the moment you start feeling confidence in yourself. Apparently.
So, the kind of person you're talking about must have a great deal of confidence on the inside.

I was wondering, is it detailed to compliment someone's clothes or say you like the color?
It's not detailed, right?
It's what you can see.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been told I'm being detailed when complimenting someone, so I don't really understand what you mean.
Was it a detailed compliment, or what?
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine told you she liked you?
I'd reply "Your confession has made my heart full-bloom in Spring, please go out with me" and start dating her.
Then, for us to go out, I'd like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what we enjoy together.
I'd like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I opt to not open a NISA account right now, can I open one later at a time that I want to do that?
If you set up a NISA account at the same time, then you can get the application process done more quickly.
Right now it takes about a week to complete.
Also, there's no separate fee, so I would recommend that you open a NISA account at the same time so it's ready for you when you do want to use it.

[Just my environment / Note to self] What caused CTD in my own MOD environment that took like a month and a half to identify
The data was stable through March but I haven't had time to play since like Golden Week, and CTDs have been happening for various reasons, and it feels like it took forever to research a little at a time mainly on my days off.
So why didn't I do log analysis with .Net Script Framework (cause if I did, I would've understood in a few minutes)? Some errors from the .dll files or related to mesh aren't in the crash logs.
• Timing of major CTDs
- Everything that should leave a log, like Papyrus or .Net Script Framework, isn't writing to the .dll plug-ins log.
- For some NPC kills / power attacks: Happens even with a console kill → Fixed by turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / updated restarted version of SE by powerofthree). *Maybe an unfounded suspicion?
- For camerawork for performing kill moves on some NPCs → Basically fixed by turning off the setting for player kill moves through the .ini: Might be competing settings for DAR and Nemesis? But then again, the upper limit for DAR animations isn't even at 10,000.
- (Basically outdoors) When moving in the field & when casting some spells (for example, Frost Rune) & when hitting NPCs: Turned off all settings applied to NPCs (top right in the MCM) using the SPID of Dirt & Blood v. 2.0, and tried 5 times in a row and it's completely fixed.
Could the cause be a mistake in the additional armor or body mesh shader settings for some actors/NPCs? There are errors in the default .ini used by the 2.0 SPID, but in the end I got the results I wanted and the prerequisite perks for the NPCs should be applied.
At first, I had the unfounded suspicion that it was motion related to OnHit or locational damage / a combat mod (a .dll one) so I mostly checked those and these are the results that I got.
There weren't even any similar bug reports in English, German, or French, I think.
If anyone's having these same CTD problems in a Japanese environment, I'm posting as a reminder since it might serve as a reference.
A lot of people are barely hanging in mentally,
and nobody notices, even family, let alone coworkers.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically, "That person works so well despite looking like they're having a tough time."
But, I'm sure they're also at their limits mentally.
I didn't retire over mental health, but I think I was at my limit around that time.
Thoughts on the importance of mental health care visits - After today's care visit
I'm bipolar so I've been getting care visits for a while and I've known the (female) nurse at the care visit station I'm using for a long time, and I think we get along really well.
We talk about all kinds of stuff every week.
Of course she handles the medication management I need (like packaging as a single dose), but at today's care visit I really felt how important fun communication is for people with mental health problems.
Today we talked about how men and women are biologically different, or debated something about gender issues lol
Sometimes we talk about things that aren't appropriate for a care visit, like male and female sex drives or why she got divorced.
Also FYI I crossdress sometimes.
But I've heard from an acquaintance that at care visit stations run by mental health facilities, for example, there are visits from middle-aged nurses who can't work in a hospital ward anymore and who come and are only business-like, or even though there is a occupational therapist visiting, they talk down when giving instructions like "I'm the one in charge of medical treatment."
The place I use is a small care visit station run by a social welfare company, but I think that she's really a good nurse who treat me, someone with mental health problems, as an equal and with honesty.
Btw she's hot lol.
I bet some of you are receiving mental health care visits or are thinking about it.
They're really really helpful for people with mental problems.
If your doctor approves, definitely try it out.
And choose a good visiting care station.
In the past, I've found ones that didn't work for me and canceled the contract from my side.
Sorry for the bad writing.
I know it was a bogus warning, but I was surprised that it appeared in English.
Why do you think it appeared in English?
There are a few things that could have caused that, for example...
・ The person who made it doesn't know how the warning would be displayed in Japanese
・ There was a problem in detecting the language
・The browser's preferred language is set to English
In the ranking of least drawn lottery numbers in the Lotto 6, the least drawn are all odd numbers,

I began working remotely due to COVID-19.
But I can't focus on work at home.
I can't relax and always pick up my phone.
Even if I drink coffee I don't make much progress.

I'm being defiant and just not focusing and being lazy lol.
It's like I'm just doing what I absolutely must at the last minute.
I mess with my phone all the time too.
Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patents 1/5 of China's ... "Korea Delays Implementation of Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese Edition) - Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The plan called for the widespread use of 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 (cumulative total) and the operation of 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price for hydrogen was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles in use only reached 27% of the target (approximately 17,000).
The number of hydrogen stations deployed has reached 38% of the target (about 117 stations), and the price per kilogram of hydrogen is 8,400 won, hardly unchanged from the price when the roadmap was originally announced.
We can see that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is well below target.
The National Federation of Economic Organizations (ZENKEIREN) released a report, titled "The Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem Current Status and Policy Direction," on December 12.
According to the report, the hydrogen industry is in fact almost entirely dependent on the United States, Japan, and other countries for its core components and materials.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.) supply membrane films, all being core materials for fuel cell vehicles.
The number of hydrogen technology patents filed among the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased at an average annual rate of 14% (since 2014).
Korea ranks 5th in the world in the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total for 2014-2020).
However, ZENKEIREN reported that, "In reality, 6 countries represent the majority of the global hydrogen market, meaning that they actually rank lower than most competing countries."
The ranking of countries by patents are: China, the U.S., the EU, and Japan, in that order.
China first overtook the U.S. in 2017, and since then has continued to widen the gap.
South Korea ranked fourth in the number of patents registered in 2020 with 1,033, ahead of Japan (974), but at only 22% of the level of China (4,721).
The ZENKEIREN proposed that "Hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax credit for capital investment and research and development expenses."
It's been a month and a half since I cut the tendon in my finger and underwent surgery.

Is it a crime if a store sells something for more than the retail price?
A store was selling PS5s for 70,000 yen today.
It's legal.
Since it's a free market, for example, rarity value of brand names increase
For example, it's considered legal for the price of an artist's works to go up after they become famous.
The reason the PS5 was selling above retail price was because it's also a rare item, so the price has simply increased.

Council Sessions on a Sunday?
Takasu Town Council Reform in Progress, Including Creation of TV Listings-style Flyers and "Report Cards" for Council Members: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Online Edition
Takasu: Takasu Town Council is working on several unique reforms, including novel flyers to announce regular council sessions, and the introduction of "report cards" that town residents can use to evaluate their councillors.
The town council elections in Takasu resulted in an uncontested election for the third term in a row, and so the council aims to drum up interest with these reforms.
Approximately 1,800 flyers with a novel design were distributed in newspapers on the 9th to advertise the upcoming Sunday council session on the 12th.
On the flyers were written things like "Live Debate in the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room" and "Saguchi Hitoshi's Exploration Series"...
The wording on the flyers distributed by Takasu Town Council on the 9th evoke the titles of popular TV shows.
Councillor Katayama Hyoe (43) who designed the flyers stated, "I hope they give everybody a good chuckle and lead to a larger turn out at the council session."

US Sends Weapons and Ammunitions to Ukraine, Also Involved in Training Troops (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo!News
(CNN) US State Department officials confirmed that a shipment of small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine by the 12th, as part of a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
This military aid is worth a total of 60 million dollars (approx. 6.8 billion yen) and a further shipment containing four radars capable of pinpointing the location of launch sites of mortars and other ballistic weapons will be sent to Ukraine at the beginning of next year.
According to press secretary Kirby of the US Department of Defense, the aid also included lethal weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank missiles.
The military aid has been sent to bolster Ukraine's defence capabilities, since Russia began to beef up its military presence along the Ukrainian border.
The US has been observing Russia's military movements with increasing concern, liaising with other NATO member nations about what do in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved the military aid at the time of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House on September 1st.
US military support for Ukraine totals around 450 million dollars for 2021.
Since Russia's forceful annexation of Crimea, the US has spent over 2.5 billion dollars in Ukrainian aid.
The US military is also engaged in training the Ukrainian army.
Last month, the Florida National Guard was dispatched to take part in a multilateral joint exercise to support Ukraine.
According to a statement by the US Department of Defense, US special forces stationed in Europe are also lending a hand in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
They did not, however, disclose the number of US special forces currently in Ukraine, to protect the confidentiality of the operation.
On the 7th of this month, President Biden held talks online with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and during which there were intense discussions regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The US has also revealed that it is prepared to impose severe economic sanctions on Russia if they attempt an invasion.

Future of the "Review" of Estate and Gift Tax that "Prohibits" Gift Inter Vivos. Conversed with Amari Akira, former Minister of State for Economic and Fiscal Policy!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" will be "Talking with Family During the New Year's Holidays!
The art of living donations and rushed inheritance'.
Although it was put off in the 2022 Tax Reform Proposal, which was expected amid the ongoing debate on the unification of inheritance and gift taxes, there is a strong possibility that 'gift inter vivos', a popular method for avoiding inheritance tax, will become "forbidden" in the near future.
How will rules surrounding inheritance change?
In addition to a direct interview with Amari Akira, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission and a member of the House of Representatives, we will provide you with everything you need to know about the basics of gifting and inheritance, as well as some tax-saving techniques to make the most of the gift-giving season before the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department Miyahara Hiroaki)
●Ranging from wealthy individuals to urban office workers, gift inter vivos will be 'forbidden.' "With the idea of taxing inheritance and gift taxes in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with a full-scale study to establish a tax system that is neutral in terms of the timing of asset transfers."
One section in the FY2021 Tax Reform Proposal released by the dominating party last year caused a great deal of consternation not only among wealthy individuals but also among the middle class.
This is because it means that the rules surrounding inheritance will be completely altered, and "gifts during one's lifetime," which are a common method to avoid inheritance tax, will be made "prohibited," resulting in a massive increase in inheritance taxes.
The universal rule for saving money on the highly progressive estate tax is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation."
The greatest weapon available, the gift inter vivos, is widely used not only by the wealthy but also by corporate employees who incur inheritance tax, albeit small, due to the fact that their homes are located within the three major metropolitan areas.
Amidst said situation is where the discussion of the "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.
Despite being expected to be released ASAP, the proposal was not included in the 2022 Tax Reform Proposal announced on December 10, where instead the policy toward unification was reiterated with more clear details revealed in statements such as: "The current taxation system of taxation on settlement at the time of inheritance and calendar gifts will be reviewed" and "The gift tax exemption is a system that does not incur a tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount (omitted), and therefore will be reviewed."
Former Minister of State for Economic Revitalization and former Minister of State in charge of Administrative Reform Amari Akira had the following to say during our interview.
"The most important thing is to eliminate the advantage or disadvantage depending on the timing of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same regardless of when the transfer takes place."
We are currently running simulations of potential problems that may occur (due to the unification)." In the case of revisions coming together at the earliest possible time, there are only 3 more chances to utilize gift inter vivos.
Even if that's not the case, it seems certain that in the near future the government will take a major step in the direction of invalidating the use of living gifts as a method of saving on taxes.
So how exactly will the rules surrounding the taxes change?

"My Right Older Brother" broadcast begins January 10th, 2022   Furukawa Yuta: "Stay tuned!"
"My Right Older Brother", an FOD original drama starring Furukawa Yuta, will be broadcasted over the air on Fuji Television Network starting January 10th, 2022 at midnight.
[Image] Yamaya Kasumi plays the heroine   Based on the manga of the same title by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, this film tells the heartrending story of their pure love as they carry their pasts with them.
The main protagonist Kairi is played by Furukawa, and the heroine Riyo is played by Yamaya Kasumi.
College student Riyo meets Kairi at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia on a daily basis, is an enigmatic young man who, for some reason, can sleep soundly when he leans on Riyo's shoulder.
Riyo is drawn to Kairi, who somewhat resembles her brother who was separated from her after her parents' divorce, but one day, something leads to Riyo suspecting that Kairi may be a murderer.
・Furukawa Yuta Comments: It's been confirmed that "My Right Older Brother" will start broadcasting from January 10th!
I hope that those who missed it on FOD can enjoy it, and if you've already seen it, I think you get a deeper understanding of the work by watching the complex psychological portrayal of Kairi and Riyo and the conflicts and changes they go through after already having a grasp of the story.
I'd be overjoyed if fans of the original work also enjoyed it.
Stay tuned!

[NFL] How it Feels to Win a Game After Only 3 Passes (BBM Sports) - Yahoo!News
In the Patriots' latest game, only three passes, thrown by Jones, were made.
This is the lowest number of passes in the last 50 years of the NFL, ever since Bills made only two passes in a game against the New York Jets in the 3rd week of the 1974 season.
The 1974 Bills lineup had an extraordinarily talented running back by the name of O.J. Simpson, who became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in the previous season.
The Bills defeated their opponents with Simpson's run and that of another running back named Jim Braxton.
In this game, the weather played a big role in the Patriots being able to run such a strong offensive.
Buffalo is located close to the border with Canada and is at the same latitude as Kushiro, Hokkaido.
On the day of the game, the temperature was around 1°C with strong winds, and it had been snowing since before kickoff.
As the local team, the Bills decided not to change their lineup much.
They made 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen made 15 of the 30 passes and ran 145 yards.
There were no intercepts, so it was pretty good play, all in all.
In their 10 offensive runs, they achieved 4 red zone incursions, and had the chance to score.
Three of the times they reached the red zone were in the end of the 3rd quarter.
However, of those three times, they were only able to score 1 field goal.
They switched to defending the goal in the last moments of the game.
The Bills, trailing 4 points, were given a penalty on the 3rd and 9, which became the 3rd and 14.
It was only 18 yards to the goal.
At the 3rd and 14, quarterback Allen was rushed by the Patriots' defense, but managed to escape the pocket and run off to the right of the field.
He attempted to pass the ball to tight end Dawson Knox, who was in the end zone, but was not successful.
During this play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran a shallow cross and became unmarked in front of the end zone, but it seemed like Allen did not notice him.
At the 4th and 18, Allen tried to pass to wide receiver Gabriel Davis who was running down the outside left of the end zone, but it was intercepted by Patriots' defensive back Myles Bryant.
Bryant had been covering the Bills' wide receiver Cole Beasley one-on-one but, on spotting Allen's movement, he released Beasley and reacted to the pass.
Allen passed into the end zone twice, each time not noticing his two receivers.
The pass in the 4th down was on target, but there was no need to aim for a touchdown with the pass from the 3rd down.
It would have been good if they had secured their first touchdown in their 2nd play.
There were still two minutes on the clock, so if it had been a 4th and short, Allen could have been in with the chance of running it in himself.
For manageable, shiny hair.

Throw Away or Replace These 3 Items that You Have Lying Around Your Kitchen (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo!News
Sponge
Even if you replace your sponge frequently, you probably don't do it as often as is recommended.
A 2017 study found that bacteria can still remain and continue to multiply even if the sponge is sterilised in the microwave on a daily basis (although this is still a good practice).
The German team that conducted the study recommend changing your sponge once a week for the sake of cleanliness.
Chopping board
The US Department of Agriculture recommends that a chopping board needs replacing when the surface starts to wear down or gets scratches or grooves in it.
Once a scratch or groove forms, it only gets more difficult to clean over time, and can harbour some nasty bacteria.
Even if it is still okay, remember to frequently disinfect your chopping board in a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach added to 1 gallon of water (around 3.8l).
Submerge the chopping board in this solution, and allow it to soak for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, and allow it to dry naturally, or pat it down with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or cracked dishes
Although it may break your heart to part with your favourite mug, a chipped surface can be a breeding ground for bacteria.
Not to mention the fact that the chipped part may cut your lips or cause spillages.
Maybe it's time to start searching for a new favourite mug!

Help FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X so I replaced it with the Tomahawk B550 I bought in September.
I got to the BIOS setup screen once but when I save the settings and restart, it gets stuck forever on a black screen with a white cursor-looking dot that's floating and not even blinking.
I thought the BIOS was broken so I used FlashBIOS to try to rewrite it, but it just won't finish.
The MSI blog says it should finish in about 5 minutes, but it's still not done after an hour.
I think it might be because the USB memory I tried was too old or because I replaced the SD card.
Did neglecting the Tomahawk too long mess it up?
Are there other causes along those lines?
Do you dislike men who always have a serious expression?
Oh! I had a friend like that.
They always looked like a vagabond.
They weren't particularly hated, though.

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to be seen carrying brand goods.
It would be okay if it was something inconspicuous, but if it was something like Louis Vuitton, with the LV monogram plastered all over it, I couldn't have that on me.
Why do you think that might be?
I think it's okay to have things that fit within one's means.
I think stuff like that is okay if it's Japan, though.
If it's Japan, that is.
It's got nothing to do with overseas style.
You should say something sooner than later, like "Why am I the only person called by my first name/talked to casually?"
If they say "You're from abroad, so does it matter?" you should tell them it makes you uncomfortable.
I think there's a pretty good chance they have no idea that you dislike it.
I lived abroad for a while, and there were many Japanese people there who didn't like the vertical society and Confucian traditions, including myself, and they were either unhinged or misunderstood that they could say anything to the locals.
If you look Western, I think they're doing it with a kind of naivete or good-naturedness, not to be mean.
I call my friends in the West by their first names, but when I speak to them in Japanese, I sometimes have a hard time deciding how to call them.
Well if they're your friends it's not so bad.
I'm sure they started doing so without bad intentions, but if you overlook it, you might not be able to stop the exclusive treatment you get as a foreigner, so you should tell them now while you can.
Like "This is Japan, so could you follow Japanese rules when speaking to me?"
Edit: Totally unrelated, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when toasting at a drinking party.
He's definitely doing it on purpose, but I think it's a good habit because when he does, he's not looked down upon by younger or older people, and gets treated similarly to a Japanese person.
There are a shitload of Japanese people, regardless of their personalities, (including me) who look at details like that.

I only understand a little bit of English, so I only judge by the translated text.
I think the translated text is at a level where it feels a little unnatural, but I understand what it is trying to convey and it doesn't interfere with the gameplay (that's just how I feel, I think you should ask others as well).
It's common to see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and for a small company, I feel that it is on the well translated side.
I think it depends on whether a non-native Japanese speaker can reach an understanding of the detailed nuances of the Japanese language after even studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel is unnatural, I suggest you look for someone else.

Observation "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba" Training is the True Battle.
"Equal Value Exchange Effort" is the hymn of humanity <Commemorating the start of 'Yuukaku-hen' > (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent shōnen manga, "Kimetsu no Yaiba" is particularly unique in that there is "an inordinate amount of training."
It's a common idea that training segments, in which there are no battles and characters train day in and day out, are less than popular among readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in the same Jump manga "One Piece," when the Straw Hat gang was separated, they went through two years of training, but it was only slightly touched upon with only a few minor details drawn.
Although, it could also be said that one of the charms of One Piece is seeing all of the eccentric lands throughout the world, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible with that.
Now, it can be said that the training of Tanjiro, the protagonist of "Kimetsu no Yaiba", began when he was told by Tomioka Giyu, "Don't allow others to hold the right over life and death!" after Giyu saved Tanjiro, and also spared Nezuko after she had tried to take Tanjiro's life.
The weak have no rights and no choice, they are forced to bend by the strong at every turn.
Even while saying so, he was kind enough to introduce Tanjiro to Sakonji Urokodaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Slayer Corps (he also happens to be a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
Upon Tanjiro's first meeting with Urokodaki, he was asked what he would do "were his sister to eat someone", and Tanjiro received a hard slap after struggling to answer, being told that his "judgment was too slow."
It's an exchange that at first sight seems irrational, and is often talked about among fans.
However, traveling with a sister who has become a demon is fraught with the possibility that there may come a moment when such a decision has to be made.
It can be said that this is an initiation into training beginning with the mindset.
Nonetheless, Urokodaki takes Tanjiro, a complete novice with zero training, to Mount Sagiri and tells him to make it down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air on the mountain is so thin, and the mountain itself is so full of traps like pitfalls and stone throwers, that there's a possibility of death before even beginning training.
Even so he uses his extremely sharp sense of smell to detect the smell of the traps placed by human hands and somehow manages to avoid them with a bit of "plot armor."
Still, within the story, Tanjiro showing "That doesn't mean I'm suddenly so physically gifted that I can get around it all, though!!" is the essence of what makes Kimetsu, Kimetsu.
Ordinary people don't suddenly get stronger out of the blue, and any 'awakening' they experience is just the ability to use "the power and skills they have honed up to that point" at their true potential.
"Equal Value Exchange Effort", where those who put in effort are rewarded as much as they put in, and get nothing when an effort isn't made, is an anthem for human beings, who are different from the demons which possess unfounded supernatural powers, and is an unmovable rule that is consistent in this work.
Is this old-fashioned?
Still not sleeping in a bed, but laying out a mat directly on the floor and sleeping in a futon and quilt.
My house is not an apartment, you see.
I do the same.
Because, if you want to use the space of the room, it is better to sleep on a futon than in a bed.
I think there are probably many people who are the same.
Do you think this is money-hungry?
If a part-time worker holds another part-time job elsewhere because they want to work full-time, is that money-hungry?
No, I don't particularly think so.
What I think of as "money-hungry" wouldn't apply in this case.
I think "money-hungry" is more like expending the absolute minimum effort and scheming to earn more than the amount worked.

Samsung Electronics Creates New "DX Division" to Marry Mobile Devices and Appliances, Looking to "Emphasize the User Experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo!News
Following on from Samsung's decision to amalgamate its CE and IM divisions into the new "SET division", the tech giant revealed on the 12th that is has settled on "DX" (Device eXperience) as the name for the new division, and this will be reflected in the company's year-end reorganisation.
The purpose of this move can be read as an endeavour to improve user experience through a variety of services, ranging from mobile devices to household appliances.
Samsung announced that the DX division, newly established by combining the CE and IM divisions, would be comprised of the VD (Visual Display), digital appliances, health & medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience) and network businesses.
A spokesperson for Samsung explained that the name change "reflects Samsung’s longer-term future-oriented business structure and stronger global leadership."
They added that the company will focus on providing leading experiences for customers with services and solutions that meet the needs of users as well as a wide range of products, from TVs and appliances to smartphones and network equipment.
Under the unified leadership structure of the newly named DX division, Samsung hopes to cross organisational boundaries and strengthen synergies among its diverse businesses to create differentiated products and services.
They are already in the process of devising a strategy that will allow users to freely consume content and services across a range of interconnected devices such as smartphones and home appliances through the application of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), as evidenced at the "Multi-Device Experience Conference".
Does 1500BCE mean BC?
How would you say it in Japanese?
1500BC.
BC means "Before Christ," but in recent years, the term "BCE" has been used more and more, perhaps based on the idea that consideration should be given to non-Christians.
BCE is an abbreviation of Before Common Era.

It may be a matter of taste, but "desu/masu style" does not seem to fit a natural science documentary narrated by a man with a low voice.
I would like to see it expressed in a heavier, more formal way.
> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armored heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
>The Japanese tiger beetle larvae lay await on the sand in order to catch their prey at any time, showing only their disk-shaped heads from the sand.
This part is a little unnatural.
"The Japanese tiger beetle larvae lay await within the sand in order to catch their prey at any time, with only their disk-shaped heads peeking out from the sand."
It should be like this.
What bothers me are:
*Did they use other documentaries for reference
*Are they looking from the perspective of an ant
I guess.
If you translate "armored heads" as "disk-shaped heads", I think the image of "to the ants, they are giant beasts wearing helmets" would be lost...
Truck Driver Who Caused a 24-Car Pile-Up in Aichi Does Not Have a Medical Condition, Was Not Paying Attention? (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo!News
In a 24-car collision that occurred in Komaki, Aichi prefecture, the driver of a semi-trailer truck was arrested and referred to prosecutors, where it was found that he does not suffer from a medical condition, and the accident was most likely caused due to carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, a 24-car pile-up including trucks and passenger vehicles occurred on National Route 41 in Komaki, causing minor injuries to 12 people.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuya (54), who was driving a semi-trailer truck, for causing the initial rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and he was sent before prosecutors on the morning of the 12th.
It appears that Nomura's truck continued to move without braking even after the collision, and firefighters on the scene confirmed that Nomura was temporarily unconscious in the moments after the accident.
However, according to investigation officials, Nomura does not have an existing medical condition, and the accident appears to have been due to some kind of carelessness on the part of Nomura.
Police are currently searching related locations and areas in an attempt to learn more about the situation.

Oginuma X's Review of Kinnikuman (Comic Volume 4) (Weekly Playboy News) - Yahoo!News
The 20th Chojin Olympics, which began in volume 3, comes to a conclusion in volume 4!
Whilst the previous volume followed events all the way from the opening ceremony to the semi-finals, volume 4 focuses exclusively on one fight, but is still chock-full of action!
●Kinnikuman volume 4 review by Oginuma X: ★★★★★ (5/5 stars)  ●For true Chojin wrestlers, the fight begins before they even enter the ring!
To summarise, volume 4 focuses in detail on the final between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but I want to point out that that doesn't mean that it only looks at the match going on in the ring.
It starts with the pre-match ceremony, and goes on to depict diversionary battles and training scenes, which is a change from the previous volume, and it takes a long time before it gets onto the match itself, although that's not to say that it's dull.
You get a sense of tension building that this will be the fight of the century, which I think is directly connected to the reader's enjoyment, so I was impressed at the way the pace has been calculated in this way.
Even before the all important final, another highlight is the small final match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Not only is it a brilliant match, I personally like the scene beforehand when Ramenman is backstage: he is looking at a poster of Kinnikuman and announces, "It'll be my turn next!"
And he punctuates this statement by chopping at it.
However, Terryman just happens to be passing at this moment, and he catches Ramenman's hand in midair, and they glare at each other silently before leaving on their way, and that's the whole scene.
What's so poignant about this scene is the fact that both of them have already been eliminated, and no longer have the opportunity to face Kinnikuman in this tournament.
That notwithstanding, they still nearly come to blows over Kinnikuman.
Seeing this, I can't help but think about what's in store for them!
As a manga artist myself, it really made me feel keenly that this is what is meant by well-defined characters!
These two wrestlers' fight was over rather quickly, but what was memorable for me was Ramenman's tearful plea after the fight was over.
He implores Kinnikuman, "Don't simply rely on divine providence!"
What a line.
It's almost a perfect meta comment on the manga itself, as I think that readers will agree with me that it feels like Kinnikuman can't lose because he's the main character, and even at times when he's not fighting to the best of his ability he'll emerge victorious somehow or other.
But, by having Rameman speak this line, Yudetamago have tied their hands so they can't use some kind of deus ex machina to help Kinnikuman get out of the situation.
This line causes the reader to think, "What, so Kinnikuman has to beat Robin Mask using his strength alone?
Alright, how?"
Thus, not being able to predict the outcome fires up the reader's imagination and, looked at from the author's perspective, this line also has the effect of Yudetamago imposing a constraint on themselves.
I thought that was a really daring thing to do.
It is without a doubt one of the biggest things to occur in this volume.

Weekend Winter Illuminations in Aobayama, Takahama-cho (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting Corporation) - Yahoo!News
Winter illuminations have been switched on for the first time at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, bathing the whole park in a gentle glow.
(December 12th) The winter illuminations began on November 26th, and feature 50,000 LED lights scattered around the paths and lawns, and up the 20m-high camphor tree.
A visitor from Shiga prefecture said, "I haven't been to Fukui for ages, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover the illuminations.
They're so beautiful, and filled me with a sense of tranquility."
Devised to allow people to enjoy a little Christmas magic while avoiding crowded areas, this is the first time there have been illuminations here, and they will continue to be lit up every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 5pm to 8:30pm, until December 25th.
The last day of the illuminations will be Christmas Day, when there will be a feast of boar stew and film screenings as part of a Christmas event.
I think the number of people who can read through an entire document in order is limited.
I had a friend who read a lot, and when I asked him about it, he told me that he could do it, but he was learning the basics of Linux, reading the table of contents in a reference book rather than a document and reading from the section he was interested in.
(In fact, it's easier to apply and understand if you learn from Linux or something similar moreso than with something abstract like docker.
It's tough to take that out of the equation and suddenly just understand everything.
It's fine if you know all of this..
) I'm telling you, you don't need to do it in order.
Also you don't memorize the contents of the book, but just vaguely remember parts you skimmed and read back over them when you need them.
I used to just never read, then go back and read after messing something up bad, so I started to read more gradually.

Live from Yonezawa: Internet Streaming, PR of Agricultural and Livestock Products by the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association｜Yamagata Shimbun
On November 11, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, consisting of cities, towns, and JA in the Okitama region, held a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," in which products are sold over a live stream on the internet.
The group 'Yamagata Ai no Bushotai' and others made a live appearance on the "National Cooperative MINATO Market TV," which was first organized by Tokyo's Minato Ward, and shared the charm of the region along with local specialty products to viewers.
The "Okitama x Minato Kaikou Project," a collaborative effort between the Oitama region and Minato Ward, led to the decision to open a store, which was broadcast live from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Kuroda Mika, who works as a "Satoyama Sommelier," introduced the appeal of the area which is surrounded by nature while wearing a shawl made by the Yonezawa textile brand "nitorito."
A sweet potato stew cookout with the Ai no Bushotai was also streamed.
At a studio in Tokyo, Kawamura Emiko of the comedy duo 'Tanpopo' along with YouTubers with a total of over 300,000 subscribers taste tested Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime rice, and more.
When they described to viewers how delicious the food was, excited comments such as "I can smell it through the stream," and "So many things that go well with alcohol, awesome." flooded in.

Something unlucky this morning...
My NAS computer stopped powering on 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~ What happened ~
1.) In the morning, I open the window to ventilate.
Computer's connected to power at this time.
2.) After a while, I come back to my room and notice a sound like Pink Rotor from my computer and shut down for now.
By that point, I thought it was that the fan started working poorly since the room temperature was down (6°C).
So I decided to try again when the room was warmed up.
3) It won't start up.
When I push the power button, the power light comes on and the fan starts to move just for a sec but it stops right away.
After that, there's nothing at all.
I take the power plug out and try again, but it still only turns on for a second.
4.) I try with all the parts disconnected from the motherboard except the ATX20 pin and the four-pin, but it won't start up.
5.) It had already been making a noise like duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh like the PSU fan was hitting something, so I kinda suspect the PSU is the cause.
Later I'll find a spare ATX power cable and try that.
Maybe.
What to do... if that doesn't work?
Change the case and the motherboard together?
Have you seen any wild rabbits recently (these past 4 or 5 years)?
Where did you see them?
In an area surrounded by nature?
I live in Tohoku.
They're all over the place around me.
Sometimes they're in my garden or company parking lot.
The Most Used Emoji of 2021, Ranked (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo!News
My most used emoji is "Loudly Crying Face".
I believe that emojis have become an essential communication tool for people today.
Most messaging and chat apps now include the option to react with emojis as well as stickers.
They are quick and easy to use, don't require a reply, and can have a soothing effect.
In fact, emojis are indispensable for achieving that soft atmosphere that is invaluable in modern communication!
But what kind of emojis does everyone use?
[View slideshow] Emoji ranking 2021: The top 10 most used emoji around the world in 2021!
The emojis that made it into the top ten were bright and positive overall.
According to Unicode, who compiled the list, 92% of people online use emojis.
The number one most used emoji accounts for 5% of all emoji use!
The "crying with laughter" emojis in 5th, 3rd and 1st place are pretty versatile, aren't they.
When something's funny, when you're happy, and even when you've messed up!
People even use these emojis in a self-deprecating way when things seem hopeless.
I think it's fair to say that someone who has never used any of the top 10 most used emojis is a rare beast indeed.
I'd like them to stick to that stance.

How do you dispose computers and peripheral devices?
* PC Farm
Brought stuff there just once, but they don't collect from Saitama for free even though they're in Misato city, Saitama.
(sometimes for free if it's relatively new)
* Inversenet
Never used them, but apparently completely free by COD if using Sagawa.
I wanna use them I think, so I wanna hear their reputation if anyone knows anything.
* Oversized trash (costs money); ETA: municipal collection boxes (free for small electronics)
* Sell used.
ETA: Mercari, Hard Off
Does anyone here sell at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used computer.
Might be a smart choice to sell while I can make money
ETA: ReNet Japan   Information from /u/CheetahPresent8059
My broken printer and old UPS that nobody will take are in the way now.
They're not oversized trash size so it shouldn't cost anything but I just keep putting it off.
My hobby is collecting coins
If anyone knows how much this coin is worth, please tell me.
Coins that are still in circulation in their country of origin are not worth anything...
In Japan, you can get notes exchanged, but you can't exchange coins
Commemorative coins are good though, because they contain gold.
Have you ever disliked somebody even though they haven't done anything wrong?
Yes, it's only human to have likes and dislikes.
"(I don't why, but) I don't like that guy", that's the nature of people you dislike.

I'm unable to get a girlfriend, but do you think I'm getting discriminated based on my looks?
Looks don't matter, it's your personality.
But it would be sad to be rejected due to one's appearance.
And it's not like you can show what's on the inside.
What did you do with your school sports kit after you graduated?
I still wear mine as casual wear ^_^
I threw mine away as soon as I graduated.
My wife wore hers as loungewear until we started living together, lol
Is it possible for someone to become satisfied with their lot in life at any time after the age of 90 or 100?
Well, you'll lose all your libido and youth.
But, if you're healthy, then why not.
Men's volleyball wins, advances to tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Foil takes fourth in men's fencing, fails to win medal
Ryujin Nippon makes Top 8 for the first time in 29 years! Qualified for the Japanese national volleyball team finals and advanced to tournament. Coach Nakagaichi: "It was a high goal."
With two referee challenges, when the third set was taken, I thought it was over, but we won with a full set.
Men's fencing foil team   No medals for Japan, loss to US
I thought they were incredible compared to the opponents until the semi-finals, so how do opponents like that wind up in third place in the finals?
I'd like to plant some trees in my garden to provide some privacy, can you please let me know what trees you'd recommend.
I'm looking for something evergreen that will be easy to care for, and that bears fruit, if possible.
Thanks in advance.
To get fruit growing on a feijoa, it would be a good idea to plant other fruit-bearing trees, like olive, blueberry or plum, nearby.
How much money do two people need to have in savings if they want to live together?
It depends on the people.
It also depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It would be best not to live together.
There's a big risk you might split up.
It would be better to involve a professional matchmaker, hold an engagement party, visit various wedding planners, and hold a wedding ceremony and reception.
There is no merit to simply living together.
In my opinion, it would be better not to do it...
Today I went to the arcade and played a game called "Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing".
Just when I thought, "Oh wow, a legendary rare," it turned out to be a revival edition legendary rare (^_^;)
Is it okay to play a game that uses cards like Ganbarizing as a hobby?
Yeah, I think that's fine.
