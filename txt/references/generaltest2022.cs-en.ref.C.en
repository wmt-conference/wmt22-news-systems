Big Czech unlucky fellow to come back soon.
Pavel Francouz has been recalled by NHL.
Czech ice-hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has passed a hard period in his career over the past few months, is going to join NHL again.
A 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and soon, he could be even in the cage as well.
The former goaltender in Litvínov, Pilsen or Thcheljabinks in Russia got injured while preparing for NHL this October.
Just at the half of the match against Vegas, he was on the bench and has not appeared on ice since then.
The incident happened the moment when the experienced goaltender was moving from one post to another.
“Pavel Francouz will be absent for about three or four week, as he's suffered an injury in the lower part of his body,” Denver team announced at the beginning of October.
His comeback to NHL's cage finally lasted for more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon of EDZ, he was recalled from a ranch, where he scored in four duels and showed his shape again.
In AHL, he scored 94,5 % of tackles.
Pilsen ice-hockey former charge wants to break through finally and confirm that he belongs to the best world's league.
In the last year, he had some troubles with his joint hips and he did not score in any of the short pandemic year's tackles.
In NHL, “Francík” scored 36times, he has reached almost 92,3 % in rankings.
Charles putting a face mask on Camilla's face in Christmas card, William and Kate posing in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photograph as this year's Christmas card, which was made during their journey to Jordan.
Also Prince Charles has published his Christmas card, he used a photograph in which he is helping his wife Camilla put a face mask on her face during a horse racing.
The BBC has informed about that on their web page.
They send the cards to their friends, co-workers and foundations which they cooperate with.
The photograph was made somewhere in a desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long summer dress in khaki colour and also Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Prince George and Prince Louis shorts and a polo T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who made the photograph, and it is not sure where it was taken.
Last year, the Royal Family posed in the Christmas card on a straw bale in front of a pile of wood at their country residence in Norfolk County.
A picture, which will be used as a Christmas card, has also been published by the successor to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photograph Sam Hussein took a picture of them in June at the horse racing in Ascot.
Charles, who is wearing a cylinder hat on his head and a face mask on his face, is helping Camilla put on her face mask that matches with a light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised one million crowns to Berbr for winning the champoinship, Tvrdík denies.
Prague – The police reportedly investigated that Roman Berbr, the accused former Vice-chairman of the Football Association in the Czech Republic, should have been given one million crowns by Prague Slavia for winning the championship in 2018/19.
Server efotbal.cz informed about that saying that they got a few police documentation.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Vršovice club board member, said that Slavie did not commit any fraud.
The server published the police wiretaping transcription in which mainly Slavia's former sport director Jan Nezmar appeared , who left the champion club last summer.
Slavia's former powerful functionary was, based on the police documentation, often in contact with both Berbr and Vyšehrad's former sport director Roman Rogoz, who has been also accused.
The police are said to have information that Slavie promised to give some money to Berbr if he wons the championship.
In 2019, team SK Slavie Praha won the championship in the first league.
The police knew that functionaries of SK Slavie Praha reportedly promised to give one million crowns to Roman (Berbr) for winning the league, as the server quoted the documentation.
One day later, Berb met, according to the police, not only Nezmar, but also Tvrdík, Slavie's chairman of the board.
It is not clear whether the police is still investigating that information.
Tvrdík denied committing any fraud.
Between years 2015 and 2017, we tried hard to change the situation in the Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative of its development.
We've never committed any fraud, influenced coaches in contrary to fair play or provided any financial compensation regarding this matter,” Tvrdík said to Seznam Zprávy.
In the record, Nezmar, among others, is unscrupulously insulting some of former Slavie players who have dark skin and he is also slandering his ex-boss Tvrdík.
The case of reportedly match influencing by coaches started in mid-October last year by the police raid to a few sites, including FAČR's Prague site.
Berbr, who doesn't work for any football association any more, has the most important position in the case.
In mid-January, he was released from custody just like Rogor, the former Vyšehrad's sport director.
Helicopters, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles is a larping of the Cold War.
Cannons will be new, but the are basically of worse quality (artillery men must get out of an armoured cabin and carry ammunition by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyoty hi-lux - these are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - good quality, moreover, Praga V3S is no longer used by special forces.
Airplanes: fighter aircrafts - good quality, but their rental is ending, airliners - too small with short flight range, but modern
Drones - only few and small kinds with no combat potential
Missiles - none (but they are produced and exported)
Anti-aircraft warfare: medium - from the Cold War period, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good quantity
I'll tell you a story.
About a hunt just next to the town.
Coypus were coming from the river and making damage to the harvest, so I went there.
When I was arriving, I saw a fisherman on the other river bank.
I didn't want to bother anyone, so I sat down quietly and that guy didn't even notice me.
I hoped that he would leave before any animals would appear, but, of course, there appeared a fox in a little while.
I let her come closer by 40 metres and then I decided to start shooting.
The poor fisherman almost scared the shit out of him, he was waving by head torch everywhere, so I shouted that I aimed at the fox.
Before I left my high seat, he'd gone.
That means, you may get into trouble even on a meadow.
On the other hand, that's not a war, that must be a coincidence so that anything might happen, you'd probably be seen through thermovision, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So go to a visible place, keep expensive things in a sleeping bag with you and you'll be all right.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior bought respirators for a much lower price that the Ministry of Health did.
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks and respirators for people who are most threatened by the COVID-19 in their jobs, spent billion of crowns to buy them in the past weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared purchase of both ministries and found out that there was a difference by up to hundreds of crowns only per one day.
Why was there such a dramatic difference in the prices?
What bodies purchased respirators economically?
And why other ones purchased for such high prices?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaking with Dominika Kubištová, an iRozhlas journalist.
I have a respect for soldiers and army (I'm not probably influenced by ČSLA memories as the older generation is), but the Czech Republic can't benefit from obligatory military service.
We don't even have big warehouses with technical equipment which could help training, we don't even have modern technologies for professional soldiers, besides, modern technologies are becoming more and more difficult, so reserve officers' skills won't be much good for the future.
Plus modern conventional conflicts where whoever can lead them will happen very quickly, there will be no time to train anyone else.
And last but not least, reserve officers/territory defense are very important for countries such as Ukraine where they can lead a mass guerrilla and it's utterly necessary to discourage en enemy.
In the Czech Republic, there will only be a fight within a conflict to such an extent and intensity that a guerrilla won't be relevant, and we don't even have a suitable geography.
And mainly, we don't have an individual skill.
And that's not the worst thing.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there occur such situations that you watch a guy who doesn't score an empty goal 2 minutes earlier, approaches attack on his own between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself “Holy shit, and what he thinks that's going to happen now?”.
Of course, they will fleece him like an average tax payer.
The situation with that skill “lead a defender” is so terrible that I found myself being sincerely surprised when I watch our striker defeating a player of the opponent.
Forerunners
The covid pandemic has been declining, however, experts do not predict any significant break in next few weeks.
Based on statistics models, there will still be lots of people in hospitals for some time, and there has appeared a new big one: the Omicron variant which has probably been spreading much more quickly than the widespread Delta variant.
At the same time, we cannot say certainly if it can cause more serious complications, if vaccination is effective or whether people will get post-infectious immunity after being infected.
However, there has also appeared a new unexpected positive phenomenon: the possibility of cure.
A new cure has arrived in the Czech Republic, namely antiviral medicine molnupiravir, which makes serious symptoms and hospitalizations less probable, by one third, and people can use it in their homes.
And soon, there should also appear medicine paxlovid developed by Pfizer, which, so far, has been reported to cure even 85 per cent of patients.
The first supplies of molnupiravir in the Czech Republic, together with hope for a wider portfolio of tools against the coronavirus pandemic, has raised the question how much the local administration is prepared for new coming medicines.
As it was said, molnupiravir developed by Merck will be the first medicine which local patients will use.
That is also because the medicine was used long before the pandemic outbreak in order to find a suitable cure for horse viral disease in the South America.
Such surveys usually don't take into account that people from western countries (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are in general less open and they don't share their point of views so openly.
On the other hand, people from eastern countries, especially Czech people, are used to talking very openly.
E.g., you make a survey on whether people like Muslims.
Most Czech people will say that they don't.
In western countries, people will say that they like immigrants, everyone should help them and that we Czechs are racists.
And then they go to elect political parties such as AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, if you say such things openly in public, you'll be fired from work and you'll be disgraced by media.
Then such surveys look nice, western countries are good, eastern countries are bad.
But the question is what people do really think.
In France, it's similar with Le Penn and Zemmour, they're supported by 20 % od people based on surveys.
We even know that there are such three buildings in the Czech Republic and they are quite identical.
They are identical for the reason of changing units so that soldiers don't have to learn again where they find things, so all buildings are completely the same.
One of them is Atom Muzeum Brdy nowadays and two other are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads in their own territory, whether because of safety or the speed of warheads fitting because of western location.
There were only kept warheads in the fallout shelters (there are two of them in each Javor), not the whole missiles, as they say.
If it were necessary to fit that weapon, a special unit, who had taken the warhead and fitted on a supporting facility, would come.
Except for the museum Javor, those two other are desolated.
When I attended the 2nd grade at basic school, I had a classmate, a gypsy, he was there for 4 years.
There were no problems with him, he made good jokes, sometimes, he was a bit hyperactive, but he was a kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, came to him and asked him to explain if they didn't understand anything, he was rarely absent, he regularly attended school, practised sports with us, didn't steal our snacks, mobile phones and he always wore neat clothes.
He also went to school field trips, made various tricks, but ha was all right, he was never in the shit.
When we attended the 8th or 9th grade, there came new pupils, siblings, gypsies, they attended the same grade, but a different class.
Shortly after that, they attacked a teacher, the police often had to solve problems with them, they menaced other pupils.
I sometimes put an advert when I want to sell something (old things that I don't need anymore etc.), and I often sold things to gypsies, they always had money, didn't try to overcharge me, the communication with them was easy-going.
I even sold a car that way, the guy called me a month later that the car had been assigned to him..
I think that I'm not a racist, I don't care if anyone has white, black, yellow, blue or whatever skin colour, until they behave like decent people (they work, make no troubles, don't beat women, just behave politely).
But if there's anyone who only needs money, makes damages to a flat, makes mess everywhere, makes troubles.. then I don't care about their skin colour, but I can't stand such people.
I don't mind migrants from Africa if they want to integrate, do business, work, learn our language (or English, at least), have respect for our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care until they respect my traditions and culture, then I will respect theirs, too.
Young woman dies in car crash in Pardubicko region
“A young woman was seriously wounded and despite the resuscitation given, she died on the spot,” Zuzana Fajtlová, the spokeswoman of southern Bohemia paramedics, said to Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot car was probably going from Žíchovec to Bavorov and for unknown reason, he went in the opposite direction.
After the crash with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot car ended up on its roof outside the road, as the accident was described by Štěpánka Schwarzová, the spokeswoman of the southern Bohemia police.
The young Peugeot driver was seriously injured.
He suffered many wounds and got stuck in the car.
After getting him out of the car, he had to be pre-treated urgently by paramedics and then, being stabilized, he was transported by a helicopter to hospital in České Budějovice, Fajtlová said.
She added that the other car driver was only slightly injured in his chest and was taken to hospital.
New regulations on packages from EU, customers not often informed
Lukáš Neuheisl make foreign orders a few times a month.
He usually buys collection cards.
“Usually, it costs tens of dollars, let's say ten dollars and more, if it's still worth importing, especially in Japan, where postal service is often free of charge,” the collector says.
Since October, orders of small packages have become more expensive, VAT has been newly added and the buyer has to give information on customs proceedings to the post office.
Then he receives an-email informing him that custom officers wait for the parcel delivery.
Then he has to fill in information about the package and if VAT has not been included in the order by the seller, it will be assessed by custom officers based on the total amount for the order including transportation cost.
In case that the address does not ensure customs proceedings, a carrier commission needs to be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole proceedings are not complicated.
I check one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and it's done.
It usually takes me five minutes, Neuheisl says.
However, not every packages are delivered in such an easy way.
Due to new customs regulations, there has been a decrease in delivered foreign orders per day in Prague post office from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond if they ask them to give details needed for successful customs proceedings.
Currently, there have been 30,000 foreign packages to be processed at the international post office.
If people filled in all details needed in time, we would processes half of the packages, Matyáš Vitík, the spokesman of česká pošta, says.
Inflation solution
See headline, how would you solve the current inflation?
At the moment, the inflation rate is 9,9 % and they expect its increase.
So in your opinion, what should the state do to stop the increase or compensate it?
For example, we can see the decrease of VAT on food and PHM in Poland, do you think that's the right way?
What in your opinion might happen, what is inevitable, what the future situation be?
Prices are increasing much more quickly that salaries, in my opinion, it' inevitable that people won't afford buying even standard products, and particularly energies.
How much has your salary raised this year (I mean as an employee)?
My gross salary raised by 2 %, which is funny, but fortunately I do some business on my own except my main job and I have the same salary from that.
Can anyone explain to me how does it come that provably convicted rapists are imprisoned for let's say just 6 months or so?
I can't get my head round it, how can be such a beast sent to prison for no longer than 6 months by a court of, and they can do the same things once they're released?
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that their victims will face trauma for several years, it will influence their sexual relations in a negative way and relations in general.
Not speaking that rape victims can face trauma from till the end of their lives.
Is it possible that the this and also future reports could prevent from raping?
Man from Hrob “fingered” his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
A man from Hrob accidentally helped police officers find his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, who an arrest warrant was issued for.
It was him who called the police.
Anyway, hi did it another way.
At first, he stopped a passer-by and told them a fake story that he had been robbed.
Police officers arrived after an emergency call and they could not believe when the alleged “robbed man” told them that he had lied in order that they would come there.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the police officers how he could make a report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking identities of the man and his girlfriend, the police found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in the nationwide manhunt, and an arrest warrant for her had been issued.
So the case has been solved by the Police of the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
In my opinion, we haven't been Slavics from an ethnical and cultural point of view for a long time, but I'd like to know what you think about it.
Otherwise, I agree to the meme, of course, pity that Churchill did not manage to save Prague by the US :')
Of course, I don't deny that we've got a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's a question if a reasonable person might believe in God without having any proof and just because one could possibly benefit from it.
I don't think that's a real faith.
I can't agree with Pascal, if I'm not mistaken, there are about ten thousand religions all over the world.
What god or gods should one choose?
I'd say that it's quite probable that in one of all those religions, there exists at least one god who will punish you if you believe in another god.
Also it is said in the Ten Commandments that there is no other God than Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more logical if one doesn't believe in any god instead of choosing a bad one among others and the very god who one doesn't choose will send them to the Hell or a similar place?
Other: Voluntary training and later becoming a part of reserve units.
The Swiss model is similar, if I'm not mistaken.
X months of training (in different skills, X months for one) and trained by experienced professional soldiers.
If one is good at it, they might be offered to do a professional service.
That would be useful for all units of the AČR.
It could be done with cooperation of the University of Defence.
We can speak like that: They have continued talking about cooperation between the educational and industry sectors, companies look for recruits at schools and there has been something like mutual penetration when working people go from schools to offices.
Not only when you grow up, but that process has been there all the time, everyone of us has still been learning new skills, changing fields etc.
A similar penetration would be also between the civil and army sectors.
I see that also like the way for building a relationship between a citizen and army, that means an institution which guarantees that Russians, Germans or a Mongolian raider will never invade us again.
It seems funny to me the way you consider the NATO as our save, we have allies and they will defend us in case there's a trouble.
Good Lord!
One election in the US might lower the budget and the whole NATO would be fucked up.
British will change us for Russian money, Germans will change us for Russian gas and Polish has showed that they would take whatever they want.
The only steady guarantee of independence is having a strong army and people who can use modern army technologies.
And every teenager can pilot remote controlled equipment nowadays, so why wouldn't that be possible.
We don't need any border fortifications, it's good for nothing nowadays, but a teenager with a spotty face piloting a remote controlled equipment will know their ropes.
How you can avoid drowning in “box tsunami”!
You will open gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly, you will get flooded by boxes and fillings?
Such “waste” is used again by e-shops which are short of wrapping materials.
For that reason, there has been made a map of shops which will welcome your used boxes.
And not only during Christmas.
Alle wrapping materials are designed in the way that they can be used repeatedly.
That's why it would be a pity if you threw them away after using.
Whoever can bring, after an agreement, carton boxes, plastic or paper filling in shops which belong to the project (the map of the project KAMsNIM.cz shows almost 150 of them).
You can support small companies, reduce waste and also overfull containers.
Shops themselves will welcome wrapping materials which have been missing on the market currently, and they will also save money, as the prices of cardboard have increased by 50 % lately.
Moreover, such shops seem to be more ecological for some customers.
TIERRA VERDE, eco drugstore and cosmetics producer, is one of those shops.
Boxes and filling materials are taken to our shop in Popůvky u Brna by individuals who have got plenty of them at their homes, however, even some companies contact us and we agree with them on taking used carton boxes from them.
We use everything when packing orders from our e-shop.
Thanks to such people and companies, we make the world more considerate together.
Our aim is to preserve sources and beauties of the nature for next generations, Petra Lopušníková from Tierra says.
However, application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection points of used materials.
It serves also like a browser if you need to get rid of anything (sorted out waste from households, expired medicine, tires, old electrical appliances, batteries, lightings, high-volume waste etc.).
All waste can be taken to the right place and things that can be used again will find their second homes.
The map of the project shows in total more than 100,000 such places.
“Slowly, there have been added civic amenity sites, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places which help find use of things that would otherwise become waste”, Miroslav Kubásek, one of the creator of the application from organisation Ukliďme Česko, says.
It rather seems bad to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use computers or mobile phones play games on them, but they don't learn basic IT knowledge.
Recently, there has occurred a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students don't understand files on computers.
Because e.g. Google Pics or Apple Pics applications or mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem including files and everything is on one monitor in the application.
They can use technology since their childhood, but they should learn something.
We rewrite history, indeed
Emmanuel Macron introduced the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend – starting in January – and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for more than one hour, revealing the presidency logo, called on for the protection of the European people – at work, in streets – and talked about so many plans that one could hardly make them up in half a year.
However, French politicians like such talks, and so do French voters.
Macron's supporters balancing between the right wing and the left wing agree on very few things, but they do on European matters.
And there will be new presidential elections in France in April.
Even priorities themselves have influenced the election calendar.
The French leader mentioned, among others, that historians should write “a comprehensive history book about Europe” and France is prepared to make conditions for such work.
Most commentators criticised immediately that Macron is just trying to make a pro-Europe campaign and rewrite history.
In fact, he is trying to prevent from rewriting history by that.
Éric Zemmour, an extreme right candidate to the French presidency, is just going around France, proclaiming that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the World War II, was not so bad and he is quite popular with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea about a comprehensive history book seriously without considering the current situation in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students from European countries study history like a story versus we and not like a story of the whole.
The Spanish, French, Czechs learn about who was defeated by whom in battles.
But if their teacher is not sophisticated, they will not learn about a wider context of occurrences.
Is Quo vadis, Aida this year's best movie?
The Czech “Mice” did not win.
A story describing the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 was also awarded for the best direction and the best actress Jasna Duričičova.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, it was at the top rankings by the audience.
In Berlin, Anthony Hopkins won the best actor prize for his performance in the movie The Father.
I'm not much young, not much healthy/fit and not vaccinated.
It was like “having the flu/being sick”. I had diarrhea for a few days and I didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse compared to the flu.
I don't have diarrhea when having the flu.
(Just my personal experience. Other people might have different one.)
Christmas book tips
A Christmas issue, which will be published on December 20th, will contain traditional literature appendix.
And some other culture tips will be published together with it.
I attach some book tips for you, subscribers, in addition to this digital issue so that you would have enough time for buying some books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts which follow the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
A new “portion” of watching the world and describing everyday life together with deep poet attentiveness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prosaic work, photographer Šesták tried to describe an essence of both a small town and the Czech society.
It's a description about return to roots which will turn just into a wanted illusion.
Czech studies and comparative literature transfer the fairy tale about the Little Red Riding hood in a real village of nowadays.
Its presentation is so brutal that it even surpasses traditional versions and becomes a horror story about an emotional emptiness.
And about that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his last but one novel, the author tells us a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration, different from what we are used to listening.
Those who stayed and those who left know very little of themselves for a common life.
New train timetables, new rail operators
Temporary train timetables have changed and new ones are effective as of Sunday.
The biggest news is change of some rail operators, e.g. between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where České dráhy are replaced by RegioJet.
Most trains will only have different departure times, or routes.
Tens of new train will be added to timetables.
Rail operators have started selling tickets since the autumn.
České dráhy are planning to dispatch 6,783 passenger trains per day on average, 478 per day of which on average will be international trains.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres of rails based on new timetables.
Except for domestic routes, trains will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovak, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland, based on new timetables.
Besides new timetables, České dráhy will add tens of new trains.
InterJet trains is breaking news, they will go from Prague to Cheb.
Other trains of new generation will appear in Moravia or western Bohemia.
As usual, the train operator will also raise tariffs with effect as of the beginning of the next year, namely by 3,2 % on average.
České dráhy include the inflation rate in their tariffs every year.
Breaking news in RegioJet timetable is that it will cover route R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The train operator will replace České dráhy there, after a successful winning the tender put by the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will dispatch 16 trains altogether daily, eight in each direction.
There will be other changes concerning international trains between Prague and Brno, which will newly stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín as of Sunday.
Leo Express will keep 16 trains, two round way trains to Slovak and also trains to Krakov over weekends.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the train operator tried, despite the planned weekend traffic closures, to keep times of their international trains.
Arriva trains and other train operators are not planning any substantial changes in their timetables.
There will be new train operators of a few local routes.
For example, there will be some changes in timetables concerning passengers in Českolipsko, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk operated by České dráhy will be replaced by trains operated by Trilex of German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will be also able to buy uniform tickets for the second year.
Just as České dráhy, their price will be raised by 3,2 % including the inflation rate.
I can't agree.
Don't we accept other people's points of view?
We can hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how much they were oppressed and they had to work hard and died.
During classes, I never heard how it was seen by slaveholders or anyone from those times, no one defends that, but just judge.
No one at school will tell you that black people were often sold as slaves by black people as well and that those were often the worst slaveholders.
No one will teach you at school that colonists often bought lands from the Indians, they just say how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, and in fact they slaughtered one another a long time before.
I spent some time in the US, too, at schools, both southern and northern schools.
No one did conceal facts, but I heard a long time before that they had done it, and in my opinion, that's a problem, I don't deny that (e.g. in Japan, no one speaks about cruel things which happened during the WWII).
I just wanted to point out that history isn't black and white and we tend to see it from nowadays point of view, without understanding it.
History doesn't study any feelings, it's just as it is and I think that it's a huge mistake to judge anything without having any points of view from those times.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat things that had happened.
By the way, while we're talking about southern states, yes, the Confederation flag and famous slaveholders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they were also successful at times and we shouldn't condemn them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better, most people make it ideal nowadays.
And many people also forget that not all people in the South were slaveholders and they didn't agree with many things, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they don't talk about certain things on purpose, they lie and manipulate with others, and they've got different points of view than we have (there was a video from TV on YT in which they stopped someone who was speaking about our legionaries and what happened in 1968).
What I found funny at US schools was the increase of Marxism and making communism ideal, they've never experienced that.
All in all it seemed to me that it was terrible at some universities, the students were quite radical and the universities even supported them.
And if I imagine that those people will be much older one day, I feel a bit sick that those people could decide about things, as they are among young people and also within the ruling elite.
It seems to me that e.g. feminism has reached what it intended and it's changed, it's become radical.
Nowadays, there are many women who have nothing to do with feminists and ignore basic biological facts, and also other groups such as LGBT, and that makes people radical on both sides, which often leads to resistance to even quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical it is, the more you can hear about it.
To summarize that, I've never heard anyone judging me for being a colonist or slaveholder.
It was rather that people didn't have good knowledge of Geography, anyway it was mutual :D
That's not that I don't like it, there's just no point in it in my opinion.
Shall I be proud of anything what I haven't managed myself?
Moreover, I consider the nationality concept useless in the respect of any personal identity.
If I have anything to do with other people, then my hobbies, points of view on the world and joint experience, not the place where we were born.
I don't believe in God, but from what I know, I can tell you this: there are two Greek Orthodox parishes, one of them is Ukrainian and the second one is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a great man, his sermons are much more about theology than politics, but then he always say something stupid about the coronavirus so that everyone is ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact, their origin was in Catholic modern and they are, in fact, Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they visit the Hussite Church sermons as they are very similar theologically, but their members are mostly more liberal.
They have a wonderful church of historical value in Functionalism style in Botanická Street.
The Church of Saint Michal on Dominikánské square belongs to Dominicans and they even make sermons in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 PM, as they were made before Vatican II.
Peace Light of Betlehem is in Czech Republic, Scouts take it in Austria
Břeclav – The Peace Light of Betlehem, where Jesus Christ, according to Christians, was born, has been taken to the Czech Republic.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Scouts did not take it in Vienna this time, they took it from their Austrian coleagues at border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
They took it at the border crossing last year, too.
The Peace Light of Betlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we learn in our group every year, we look forward to it so much.
I'm honoured that I've been chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists.
While the handover took place at border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen last year, directly on the border bridge, this time it happened at border crossing Reintal – Břeclav, at the car park.
Anyway, the Scouts usually go to take it by train in Vienna.
The distribution of the light has not changed.
The Scouts took the light and went by train in Brno at first, where they gave it to bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The Scouts couriers distributed the light on Saturday December 18th, they will go by selected fast and passenger trains.
The local Scouts or volunteers will taje the light from them, who will then distribute it in other Czech regions with no railways.
The Scouts have to keep anti-covid regulations this year, too.
It is the same as last year.
We give recommendations to both courier teams and local events organizers, they should, of course, wear face masks, try to keep distance, avoid gathering, not sing together with their colleagues, just behave in a safe manner, Zuzana Hrbková, the spokeswoman of the Peace Light of Betlehem event, said.
The tradition of the Peace Light of Betlehem, which is distributed across Europe, was created in 1986, Austria.
Its aim is spread the idea of hope, light, friendship and peace together with the Peace Light of Betlehem.
For Christians, the Peace Light of Betlehem is a symbol of hope, light that overcomes dark.
The male and female Scouts have been in charge of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than thirty years.
The event is organised with the help of hundreds of volunteers, the light is also a symbol of unselfishness and human mutuality.
All news, including the list of all sites where people can come and take the light, are available on webpage www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I didn't study economics, so I don't know the basics of economics according to which subsidies are bad for economy, but I don't think that subsidies are trouble as a whole.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. increasing prices of water), health service and school system use all the money properly, I just don't understand why the money are invested in agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As I mentioned - there is produced a waste product and it threatens the free market and “a company natural life”.
I work in a company where you can see billions of posters “xy funded/co-funded by project xy” in corridors, such a company is just artificially subsidized to survive.
That isn't any support of a company which gives work to many people, that's development holdout as the company just survives and takes orders/employees from other companies that might develop and increase their productivity after its downfall.
I completely agree, that's terrible.
Sometimes, even a person who was born at the time of the Internet, is tricked or trapped - especially by commercials.
I personally think that Internet commercials don't influence me, but finally I get tricked and I'm influenced by them - they're made like that, one can't always resist.
For that reason, I support radical speeches at the European Parliament that want to impose a complete ban on programmed (= targeted) commercials...
Those are dirty tricks, in words by a classes - I'd ban the Internets.
It's my feeling that this belief has its roots in the following (but mainly in point 1):
1. “I will not believe in anything what most people do and it makes sense, I'm not sheep, but I'd rather believe something what's less probable, it doesn't make any sense, but it's important that I have my own opinion which I'll say about it's critical thinking.”
2. “I will not believe in everything what media say”
3. “I don't trust politicians”
Televisions keen on Christmas movies trend, first nights of two hundred of them this year
Los Angeles – Movies, televisions and stream platforms in the U.S.A. and other English speaking countries have been keen on Christmas movies and they are going to introduce more than two hundred of them to spectators this year, which is record-breaking.
IMDb operator of the movie database counted the figures.
Christmas family and romantic movies have been very popular with spectators lately and the ratings has been increasing, that's why more and more of such movies have been produced.
This year, four times more Christmas movies have been made compared to year 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
IMDb database includes only those movies which include word Christmas in their titles, so there will be much more such movies, in fact.
There have always been movies which people consider Christmas ones.
In the Czech Republic, mainly fairy tales are typical for this period of the year, the most popular movies in the world are e.g. Sám doma, Láska nebeská or a traditional Christmas story Život je krásný from 1946.
But a real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable television Hallmark introduced a special movie series, BBC reminds.
Their Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four movies at that time and it was a great success.
This year, the television has started to attract their spectators since October 2nd and they are to launch 42 Christmas movies altogether.
The competitive channel Lifetime will launch 35 new Christmas movies this year, and the total number includes also favourite stream platforms, such as Netflix.
“During this charming period, the story itself is not so important, but it is important if you see lots of Christmas trees and snowing behind,” Brandon Gray, the author of book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, describes this period.
“It's an escape for spectators, the way how they can for at least two hours feel a bit calm during that all Christmas and world madness we've been living in over the past years,” Gray adds.
According to him, Hallmark, for instance, makes still the same movies, which is uniform, but successful.
There are two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is explained and those two ones kiss one another.
And it's still the same and until all movies are made like that with a similar atmosphere, people will watch one by one, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive, he is not to participate in final F1 race
Only 19 drivers will participate in Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in F1.
Nikita Mazepin has been tested positive of COVID-19 and he will not participate in the final race of the season.
So stable Haas will send one racing car only.
In the final race of the season, he was supposed to reach a better position than the 20th, which he got during the qualification.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from stable Haas will not participate in Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in F1 finally.
He has been tested positive of COVID-19.
So only 19 racing cars will be on the starting line, Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher will start from the last place, Max Verstappen, who will probably encounter Lewis Hamilton, will start from the first place.
According to stable Haas, Mazepin is quite well and has had no symptoms.
Nikita is all right, as he had no symptoms.
He is isolated now and he will respect public health authorities instructions, as security is a priority for all interested parties,” spokesmen of formula1.com said.
Haas will not send a stand-in driver in the race, they even can't
A stand-in driver would have complete the qualification or drives in another part of the weekend.
Not only one driver has been ill with COVID-19.
Kimi Räikkönen was also infected by COVID-19 at the end of the season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positive last year.
You can be imprisoned for that as well.
And no one will care that the boss said.
According to law, covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
That means it's included in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhoid.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive jumper is amazing!
It is a bit like a movable jeweller's shop and its creator invested a half-a-year effort and all his savings in it.
“I had a vision of what I'd wanted to create, but only little experience, my family haven't worn jumpers a lot,” Liban, who spent 3,000 hours creating the project, said.
He bought silk in Italy, 24 carat golden threads in France and 2,000 small decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski company.
Then he decorated silver stars with 150 diamonds.
“Wool and cotton are basic materials, but it's silk what gives the jumper its softness,” the creator praises his work, which, however, he doesn't recommend to be washed.
And there is another catch in it.
“I'm totally broke, I must sell the jumper as soon as possible,” Liban admits.
If he is successful, a new world record will be set.
The most expensive jumper so far was sold for “only” 720,000 crowns five years ago.

But how could we raise the funding?
The EU gives us a lot of money as subsidies.
It it stops doing that, we won't get the money any more.
I don't really think that if the EU stops giving us money, we will use it for anything else...
You can say that the money from the funding could be used better, but that's another question.

Has Omicron variant spread in the south of Moravia?
The Public Health Authority is checking a new case of the Omicron variant in a child from Adamov.
“At the moment, there has been reported a new case of the Omicron variant in another child from a preparatory class in Adamov.
There has not been any proof of a direct contact with the previous cases at basic school in Adamov,” Ciupek said.
There have been reported six cases in the region over the past week.
“We are still waiting for an official confirmation of the Omicron variant in those six cases – it is done by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague,” the directress said.
She added that the cases included two nurses from the same department at the University Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, and then two 11-year-old pupils from basic school in Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the directress, three of them have light symptoms, four of them have no symptoms.
None of them travelled abroad.
None of them travelled abroad, neither any of their relatives, they were not in contact with anyone who was abroad.
There is no connection between the Water Polo Championship and the cases, Ciupek said.
The main public health officer Pavla Svrčinová said that they were checking the International Water Polo Championship, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago.
Two players from the South Africa took place in the championship and a Belgian player became sick after his return.
California to restrict gun sale.
They want to take the same measurements as Texas when banning on abortions.
Gavin Newsom, California Governor, announced on Saturday that they intended to restrict the sale and production of some sorts of guns in the most populated American state, with the help of the law mechanism used by Texas when approving the controversal ban on abortion made after detecting embroy's heart beat.
People would be then entitled to a compensation when taking legal steps against anyone who produce or sell assault rifles and homemade firearms.
Newsoma's announcement was a reaction to Friday's statement of the US Supreme Court which made Texas ban on abortion valid, although it's been against almost 50-year-old precedent that set out the right to abortion throughout the U.S. up to approximately the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not decide whether the law was constitutional, but just a technical view of it, which arises from an innovative construction of the regulation.
The ban enforcement has been transferred to the public in this case, so Texas Republicans have made it impossible to be contested before the court of law.
“I'm outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the US Supreme Court which didn't abolish Texas ban on most abortions and supported Texas greatly in their aim to protect their law,” California Governor said.
“If states can now block reviews of their laws by federal courts, then California will give such an authority for human lives protection,” Newsom continues.
He said that he had charged his staff, while cooperating with the state parliament and the Ministry of Defense, work out a measurement which would make possible public representatives enforce a ban on assault rifles and the so-called ghost guns.
That means homemade guns which have no serial numbers and can be used in order to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants that “private citizens” would have the right to ask for a compensation at least in the amount of 10,000 dollars (more that 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone in California who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles, “ghost gun” parts or kits for their production.
“If that's the most efficient solution how we can keep those terrible guns out of our streets, that means the threat of private prosecutions, then it's just the right thing that we should do,” California Governor said.
AP agency points out that California imposed a ban on the production and sale of some sorts of army-type guns for a few decades, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
In case that the state really imposed a ban again, using Texas template, then it would be the confirmation of what Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal member of the Supreme Court, who in a disapproving reaction to the majority court Friday's decision warned against the spread of the existing law mechanism in other American states,stated.
However, the Supreme Court did not give Texas ban on abortion a full immunity against court reviews and enabled abortion hospitals keep on taking legal steps against a few officials in the southern American state.
Every emergency vaccination has a testing period during which they step by step get to know what the vaccination scheme will look like and also vaccines are being improved at the same time, based on results.
E.g., there have been many studies on the effects of 4th dose from Israel.
And according those studies, the dose has boosted up antibodies five-fold at most patients, which has a long-term effect, as you mentioned.
It's just the same as any other vaccination and there will be a vaccination schema after some time, it's just too soon now.
Another fact is that there will be launched a new vaccine on the market in a short time, based on inactivated virus, which should be 10x times more effective, according to the manufacturer's promises.

How can I watch the Champions League online legally?
Do you know if there's any online service here in the Czech Republic that would enable me watch the Champions League for a fee?
We've got Netbox at home and I pay for a package of sports channels Telly to watch the Spanish and British football Champions League.
However, it doesn't include the UEFA.
I think that O2 offers watching the Champions League, but I don't want to change the television and Internet provider.
Poland threatens they would suspend payments in EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against law in case if it used the new power and stop funding to Poland because of the legal dispute.
The Commission has postponed the approval of the Polish intention of receiving 36 billion eur from the EU budget to renew its economy impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
And it has been under the European Parliament pressure to move towards and use a mechanism enabling stop the EU subsidies to countries which violate the principles of a legal state.
“Poland should reply to this blackmailing by the EU and use a veto in all matters which need to be approved by all countries,” Ziobro, leader of Solidární Polsko, which is very important for the current government's decision makings, said.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which has caused a drastic increase of energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will insist that Poland will suspend its payments in the EU budget.
That would be justifiable regarding the fact that the EU has unlawfully denied that we receive funding from the EU budget, in which we also sent payments, the Polish minister added.
Regarding the EU, his party has a more radical opinion than the ruling party Právo a spravedlnost.
According to the European Commission, the changes that have been made to the Polish justice during Ziobro performance have been a threat to its independence and it has been influenced by politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels has set “unrealizable conditions, as their aim is not a legal state, but establish of a new government in Poland”.
Warsaw has faced a “political dictate made via blackmailing and an effort to undermine democratic decision of a few millions of the Polish”, Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such a EU that would be based on sovereign states partnership, and not on ruling of the most powerful ones and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not democratic.
He said that his party will never accept such compromises of Brussels that would reduce the sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree with that Poland would be just a colony,” he stated.
But how can one knows anything about it... in nearby Lidl, they sell one kind of cheese at four different places.
I wasn't looking for other products, I saw a yogurt a few times, I just needed a piece of cheese, Parmesan, after ten minutes which I spent at the shelves with dairy products, I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's truth, there was almost no one left at the narrow section, less common and special cheese, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free products section...
If possible, I won't go to any supermarket any more, whatever sales they would have, I will go to a shop at the square, they don't have such a wide range of products, for sure, but they usually have everything what I need and it's well-arranged, so I can do the shopping in ten minutes.
If I went to Lidl, I would have to take a day off.
And I don't care any more.
I've been watching for two years how data have been treated, most vaccination opponents are just a little bit out of the picture than most vaccination supporters.
There are some intellectual discussions, however, there are only released extreme opinions.
It's a wall-to-wall carpet.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is good for nothing.
Everything should be banned, everything should be allowed.
Sweet cakes instead of big analysis.
Comparing apples and pears.
This state does it in that way and so do we.
But no one matters that the method of data collection is different in those two states.
Ugh, I've vented my feelings.
I'm sorry for this comment and wish you have a nice day.
I was spanked by a wooden spoon as a child.
It was never because of grades I got at school, it was usually because I repeatedly refused to obey and I was naughty (I read instead of going to bed, I fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without being warned before, Mom always warned me at first that if I did it once again, I'll be spanked (she sometimes even just brought a wooden spoon after “having caught” me and put it the way I could see it).
Only then I continued on being naughty, I was spanked a bit (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (to a reasonable extent) are good as it's much more effective than words.
According to me, it's important to warn a child before spanking, because a child can choose then if it's obedient or not and will be spanked, or if it behaves better and there will be no punishment.
As for me, my parents usually just warned me and I was obedient finally.
System protection
When an important Czech lawyer and constitution judge Vojtěch Cepl answered in 1999 to a journalist's question what the Czech Constitution means for him – whether a sacred document to swear on and about which children are taught at school, or, on the contrary, an agreement which can be amended if necessary, he definitely chose the first option.
Once democratic principles of our lives have been set out by the Constitution which at the same time define who we as a state and its people are, and there is no need for many changes.
And imagine: some nations even love they regulations.
Just as Czech people love dumplings with roasted pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl replied to that question.
However, some lawyers started to believe lately that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
Over the past years, it has been tested by situations which its authors (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, e.g. the directly elected President's attitudes.
However, Cepl was right about one thing.
All that we know about such documents shows that political intervention in its contents need to be considered.
We need to understand and protect the Constitution, only then it can be the key to manage most crisis which have always happened in societies.
The Constitution is, among others, a kind of a set of rules which consists of individual regulations which set limits to politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused towards minorities or individuals, so that's why we limit politicians by bans.
But at the same time, the Constitution also enables that politicians have some power.
Covid do not choose, even a few-month-old babies fight for life in faculty hospital in Brno
Although children usually have mild symptoms of coronavirus, some of them might have, anyway, much more serious symptoms, which hospitals have been struggling with lately.
“We know that children are threatened and impacted less than adult people, it's estimated between 2 and 5 per cents compared to adults,” Petr Dominik, the chief of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation, the University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, said to Novinky.
The symptoms are usually very mild and there are often no symptoms.
But there are small patients who have much more serious symptoms of the coronavirus, which has been obvious lately,” Dominik added.
According to doctors, that includes tens of children who need intensive care.
They are treated in the department of child infectious diseases.
There have been more children with very serious symptoms in ICUs lately.
Children with post-covid syndrome have been in the department continuously within the whole year.
“There have been more cases of children with covid pneumonia, which means pneumonia and that those children have to stay in resuscitation beds,” he said and added that this disease is infectious for both adult people as teenagers and also a few-month-old babies.
There are also children in very bad conditions because of the coronavirus in hospitals.
“At the moment, we have both a few-month-old baby and a teenager here,” the medical chief said.
However, he is happy that so far, no child has died of the coronavirus in the faculty hospital for children in Brno.
Based on surveys, six children of the age between 0 - 14 have died in the Czech Republic by December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is a necessary part – not only in the coronavirus department – of their work in hospital.
He also points out that both adults and children have very mild symptoms in case they have been vaccinated and there are less cases of post-covid syndrome at the same time.
“That's why we recommend that also children should be vaccinated,” the physician added.
In a quiet zone, you are only allowed to walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't much big.
You can see them on a tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere outside quiet zones in netaional parks (but don't climb over the fence into the game forest).
You aren't allowed to ski/ride a bike outside marked paths in the forest unless you've got a dispensation (but, of course, it's not much monitored outside national parks).
How does a musical conductor train?
I can hear music in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He was educated in Liberec opera and he originally played the French horn.
As an opera singer, he can sing almost all repertory, and as a musical conductor, he performs not only in F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also e.g. in J.K.Tyl Theatre, in Pilsen.
He cooperates with the symphonic orchestra in Hradec Králové, the movie philharmonic or the symphonic orchestra in Krkonoše.
China appears to manage infection and that authoritarian regime faces crisis easily
Sinologist Jirouš: China appears to manage the infection and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis easily.
China has started health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing faced criticism that they did not manage to stop the spread of the infection which turned in a global pandemic.
At the moment, countries are reporting no new disease cases.
States including the Czech Republic compete for Chinese protective aids and Chinese physicians help fight with COVID-19 in many countries, e.g. in Italy where the situation is the worst.
How should we perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is that a friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve their world image?
A man meets a friend of him and tells him: Listen, would you like an elephant?
I've got it and it's great.
My wife likes it because it eats grass, it washes the car with its trunk, the children plays with it.
Just amazing.
I could sell it to you for 5000,- crowns.
The friend: Ok then, agreed, that will be great...
After some time, they meet again and the man who bought the elephant complains: Holy shit, what kind of elephant did you sell to me????
The grass is damaged, there are big shits everywhere, the children are afraid of it and my wife wants to divorce with me.
The other one says: You shouldn't talk about the elephant like that, or you won't sell it...
Global events are controlled by world powers.
Although independent states are equal, world powers control global events.
Europe only could become a world power if it improves its integrity.
So far, it's been existing at economic and political level (at some points), however, a military integrity has been missing.
Personally, I think that Europe has aimed at federalization.
It won't happen in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But let's say in the middle of the century, there will be different circumstances and that will happen.
I also had such an idea and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech language, so I may be word-splitting.
I just know that en ellipse usually includes 2 different units which are at the same level.
I will quote another example, in a sentence “Spanish oranges and tangerines”, it's clear to everyone that both are of Spanish origin, while in a sentence “Spanish fruit and tangerines” it's not evident if tangerines come from Spain.
Moreover, the sentence is “of all American troops”, that means including their weapons and I know that American premises are only operated by the Americans.
In other words, I expect that it's included in it in the term of wide comprehension and we don't have to specify that any more as for the American troops.
But again, I may be just word-splitting. :D
Either way, that request makes no sense.
Earthquake of magnitude 5 strikes Tokyo.
The capital city of Japan, Tokyo, and surrounding areas were stroke by an earthquake of magnitude 5 on Sunday.
Witnesses reported that the capital city buildings were trembling, however there have not been reported any damages so far.
There was not even issued any alert against tsunami, as Reuters informed.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured pygmy marmoset called Milly
Terrifying videos show the moment when the scared monkey had been crouching in the toilet bowl before her cruel owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebab and hamburgers, regardless her real food needs.
She has been banned for life from keeping any animals by the Municipality Court in Gwent, The Sun reported.
Experts on monkey rehabilitation who takes care after tortured Milly said that they never had seen so scared pygmy marmoset.
Milly rehabilitated at Monkey World in Dorset for almost two years and now she is happy playing again with another saved monkey called Moon.
The mother of four children confessed to two accusations of a protected animal torture.
She has been given a 12-week suspended sentence for one year by the Municipal Court in Gwent.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, she has been banned for life from keeping animals and she has to pay penalty of 12,000 crowns for court costs.”
The Small Monkeys team leader Steph Sawyer, who rehabilitated the tortured animal, said: “Milly is doing well, but we will continue in rehabilitations.”
Milly needed some time to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid whenever she saw anyone or heard any loud noise or sudden movement made her cry.
The small monkey also refused to eat and drink for a long time.
Even now, whe she is happy again, living together with a male, she may panic when she sees new people.
She will have some panic attacks forever, Sawyer adds.
The torture of Milly came to light after the police of Gwent had found terrifying videos in the woman's mobile phone after a raid in her flat because of the accusation of keeping drugs.
We can hear how the woman is swearing Milly vulgarly.
Next video shows how Holland is offering cocaine to the monkey and saying: “Do you want coke?”
So lick my fingers then.
In May, she and her boyfriend Russell Cox (43) confessed to keeping cocaine, which they intended to sell.
The police found cocaine for 1,600 pounds (almost 50 thousand crowns) in her house, which was hidden in Kinder Eggs.
After that, Cox was imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from the prehistory three times subsequently if you go bravely through the 20th century?
Do you mean that you will get the same things when you attend either the 1st grade or 6th grade?
And that all is killed by the idea of boning up, and nobody is concerned, with a few holy exceptions, if you know or understand that.
You have to pass a test at first and then no one is concerned.
Go out and ask some people at random if they manage to determine the roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients.
Everyone got through it, and most of them don't get a look in and they tell you that it's all completely fucked.
So why the fuck they learn that for?
I'm a great fan of general knowledge and the reality is that people don't want to and they don't need to.
And it's just wasting of time at that moment and you will never get that from them.
Partly they teach the plenty of people who won't need that.
But as for the note that you don't need that at all while working with a machine, I meant that quite seriously... because you just don't need that.
Moreover, the times have changed and it's a sign of decadency if you don't know anything.
(Which is probably also partly due to communism, which was a part of our history, and discrediting of educated persons and elites) However, we will pay much if there will be barbarians working with the machines.
For example, if journalists could count, then covid would never reach such dimensions.
Married at first sight: war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why why he can't leave Switzerland immediately” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to curious questions of her fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to break up with him and even block him in all social networks.
There were disputes between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and he thought that Andrea would move there to be with him, until he returns to the Czech Republic.
But she definitely refused.
And as we can see, their relationship was not a happy ending, but it rather escalated in mutual contempt or even hatred.
You'd planned that! Kadri replied angrily when Andrea accused him of lying, gambling and getting into debts.
Even Linda, Kadri's younger sister, did not like Kadri's ex-wife confess.
She decided to stand up for her brother openly.
I don't usually give my opinion on such matters at all and also in my family, we had never spoken about such things.
Certainly, that's not my intention to make anyone regret.
However, if I see anyone who openly tries to hurt and malign one of my close ones, then I express my attitude!
I'm sorry that I must do that in such a way, but I'd like to take this opportunity and thank my brother Kadri how he helped our family when we did need his help, even though he was so young at that time.
So I feel really sorry to read such untrue information, which has probably been out of context.
I wish so much that everyone could get to know Kadri just as I know him, our relatives and family, she responded to Andrea's words.
I'm really so much grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what media say, but the most important is that we, his family, love him very much and that we know what the truth is, she added indefinitely.
Drunk thief climbed facade to fifth floor.
You will not believe why he did it.
Cchao started his plundering intention at the car park in a residential district where he tried to burgle into a few cars.
As reported, he finally stole almost 330 crowns from one of the cars.
After that, he had an idea of climbing to the 5th floor and breaking into a flat through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One of the safety cameras caught him when he was leaving the scene down the street while eating a banana.
When the flat owner woke up next morning, he found out that the bananas had disappeared, and called the police.
Cchao was arrested by them.
The man confessed that he drank some alcohol that day.
And because he needed money, he decided to steal anything while being drunk.
The crime is being investigated.
A drunk man climbed the facade to the fifth floor and stole bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and its effectiveness is related to pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't be effective.
The scope of business is limited by the law.
Isn't that a good reason for you?
Freedom of assembly will be restricted, but it won't be cancelled.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think that you know very well everything what people write to you here.
You just pretend to be a silly one so that you could “argue” with anyone.
If not, then it's sad.
I don't say that the Christians are degenerated, nothing like that.
On the contrary, I quite like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, in fact, was their purpose to look nice).
And I don't quite care who is a believer.
On the other hand, I don't like what great power the Church used to have in the Middle Ages, how much money it took from people, that it restricted science etc.
Not to mention all those wars which it caused, e.g. the Thirty Year's War.
Tl;dr: you can believe in a spaghetti monster, for all I care, but the state and the church don't match together.
Man falls upside-down from height of twelve metres.
He survives the crash into the pavement.
A man survived falling down like by magic in Ostrava on Sunday night, regional paramedics arrived and treated him.
An hour after Saturday's midnight, regional switchboard centre's staff answered an emergency call informing them that a man fell down from a height.
Two teams of rescue workers - paramedics and physicians - went to the scene immediately.
After their arrival, they could see that the 27-year-old man was supposed to fell upside-down from a height of twelve metres and crashed the pavement!
Coal caught fire in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, so a fire brigade was sent there.
Once they arrived, the man was unconscious, had many wounds and was in direct danger to life.
Paramedic on duty intubated the man's airways, provided him mechanical ventilation and after giving him pre-hospital emergency care, the man was taken by an ambulance to the trauma center in Ostrava hospital, as Lukáš Humpl, the spokesman of ZZS MS region, informed.
I am much more afraid of inadequate reactions of public and authorities rather than of the coronavirus.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officers, but those are mainly physicians and medical staff who have been on the frontline when fighting with the infection.
How much is the situation serious from their points of view?
We are asking army physician David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes defeated after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of amazing results.
There were happening things during the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňa was able to defeat legendary female wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not been defeated for seven years.
Lightweight Charles Oliveira did not hesitate, he performed an excellent choke on Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Also Kai Kara-France won when he quickly overcame Cody Garbrandt by a technical KO in the first turn.
Also Sean O'Malley defeated his opponent.
That was a surprise that no one had expected.
That was a female bantam weight wrest between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňa.
The American entered the tournament as an imaginary “dwarf”, as Nunes was not defeated for seven years and she intended to reach a new triumph.
The beginning of the duel was happening just as it had been predicted.
Nunes started her way to the victory in a very acctive way and she gave her opponent push kick, by which she was sent down.
However, Peňa did not allow to be forced make another mistake and she tried to attack by armbar.
The second turn was amazing and very thrilling for MMA fans.
Both opponents gave one another many excellent strikes and hooks.
Besides, Peňa back mounted Nunes where she started to choke her.
She had to resign and replay the attack.
The American prepared a big shock to everyone when she became the champion.
The top of the gala evening was a duel between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight championship.
At first, Poirier was luckier, however, there was a break soon.
In the second turn, Oliveira tried to be more active and defeat the opponent by armbar.
He was not much successful, however, then he made a great pressure, back mounted his opponent and gave him a series of hits.
He won the second turn as a result.
In the third turn, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to replay the attack.
The Brazilian retained the title, Poirier was, on the contrary, defeated after two years.
In the next tournament, Sean O'Malley was a definite winner when he gave Raulian Paiva a hard guillotine in the first turn.
Then he finished by series of direct hits and reached the 15th triumph.
Kara-France then defeated Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes reached another triumph with her small daughter, who was defeated after seven years.
Hip joint - masculinum or femininum?
At first sight, it's nothing difficult.
Most similar nouns in Czech language only have one gender, and thus it's not difficult to determine whether it's a masculinum or a femininum or a neutrum.
However, there is quite a big group of nouns that might have more genders.
Such nouns have both genders.
They have both masculinum and femininum suffixes while being declined and some of them can't be even declined.
For example, words “trouble” or “hip joint” can be both a masculinum and femininum, in the first case, they are declined according to the example word “machine”, in the second case according to the example word “song”.
Another group of nouns include different forms in the 1st grammatical case in singular, e.g.: “řádek/řádka”, “kedluben/kedlubna” or “brambor/brambora” (food).
Both forms are standard, they have got the same meaning and they can be used voluntarily.
There might be slight differences in word meanings depending on a region, e.g. “okurka” in Bohemia and “okurek” in Moravia, however in this case, the Moravian word is informal, there are some more similar words in Bohemian and Moravian forms: “příkop” and “příkopa”, “kobliha” and “koblih” etc.
Some words which were taken from other languages were not originally declined, however, they've started to take Czech suffixes.
A typical example is word “image” which have both gender, masculinum and femininum, or word “bufet” which is not declined in neutrum but has sufixes in masculinum according to the example word “castle”.
Turkey opened gate for immigrants into Europe.
What is the situation like just at the Greek border?
There has been tension at the Greek-Turkish border because of an increasing number of immigrants who are trying to enter Europe.
Thousands of people have set out to the southern border of Schengen after Ancara stopped keeping them from doing that.
European politicians have promised to help Greece, also the Czech government is going to provide humanitarian aid.
What are the immigrants motivated with?
And what is the situation like just on the spot?
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and suffocated, a journalist from Sydney describes.
Almost thirty people and hundreds of millions animals have been killed and a few million hectares of the ground have been devastated during devastating fires that Australia has been fighting with for four months yet.
How do local people and authorities overcome such a disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent far-reaching impacts, as their critics say?
And what should the country be prepared for in the future if there will be more climate changes?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaking with Ika Detrich, a journalist from Sydney.
There have always been frames and they're quite rare.
That's why they write about each of them everywhere.
People don't like solving sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they avoid talking about it.
Personally, I don't know anyone who has been framed.
But I know many people who were raped and I could see how other people or the police treated the victims.
We should always believe victims.
Nowadays, victims have started to talk about their traumas finally.
Still, many people don't tell anyone.
Yes, there are some people who are able to frame someone.
That's awful and depreciation of sexual violence victims, but if you say that “most accusations are frames” and that it's “trendy” you only help sexual rapists.
More and more unfinished family houses in Czech Republic, families lack of money
Prices of building materials have increased more than by 30 per cent over the past weeks.
Many people have had troubles because of that.
They do not have money to finish the building of their family houses and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
Except for material prices, prices of building works have also increased.
That's why people do not have lots of money to finish the building of their family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which makes them troubles.
In better case, people move to unfinished and non-approved houses.
In worse case, they cannot live in their unfinished houses and families have to sell them, as they cannot afford paying both mortgages and rents,” Štěpán Křeček, BHS economist, says.
We build two or three family houses per year, and fifty per cent of them are those cases.
As we're a building company, it's difficult for us, because we are bound by contracts, although prices of materials have increased.
So we work without making profit,” Zdeněk Slivoň, a building company owner, says.
Many people will have financial trouble in the near future.
If they had a budget of five million crowns for building their houses, it will cost seven million now.
I think that some of them will be postponing,” Slivoň added.
Currently, the most expensive materials have been copper, iron and also plumber and heating equipment.
Another problem that building companies have faced is lack of staff.
There is a lack of construction field graduates in the Czech Republic and foreign workers cannot work here due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Only the issuing of building permits have improved lately.
“Building offices issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost by 10 per cent more than last year,” Křeček added.
We are fine and we will be even more fine.
However, any real vision is missing, as a ČRO – mujRozhlas broadcaster says.
The new year's entrance was, except for traditional celebrations, accompanied by speeches of politicians.
This year, not only Prime Minister and leader of ANO party Andrej Babiš ans President Miloš Zeman, but also chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What is the most important thing that they told us?
That's why a diploma thesis seems to be great to me, I've chosen my own topic, I follow up with my bachelor thesis, I always work on it the whole year and then I make a written part in 1 or 2 weeks.
Final examinations are no trouble, if one isn't stupid and remembers something, the committee will not make it hot in theory.
As for me, I prepared for the examinations for a week and when I didn't know what else, the committee always tried to help me find any logical connection, which I found and that was correct.
When speaking about the projects, I know a few people who pay someone who makes the project for them (we've done that many times, very helpful, indeed, you can learn a lot), and then they just learn the project and they're gonna be set.
In my opinion, it's great that every subject is finished by a test which shows your knowledge that you get from the project, not only defending a thesis.
Everything's all right, but do not send plenty of e-mails and phone calls and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same mother-fucker as them.
The people at the embassy might have nothing to do with that.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a huge risk, so they may be on their side, or anything might happen.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie-the-Pooh.
And you can put it in a way that it would reach Xi Jinping's ass or so.
I agree, even though Insta throws artists curve balls.
Once you don't add stories every day and a new picture at least every other day, ranges will decrease to minimum.
Furthermore, it's been often changed what function is the most important, whether a like, comment or save.
It's pissed me off so much lately, so I may have to lower to tiktok, where many artists in my business are successful and they won't hear a word against it.
Finally I'd be maybe glad if there were something more user friendly what doesn't draw creativity and energy from artists.
Donbas Worker's Party statement
Union – yes, break – no, opponents of the USSR dissolution in the picture expressed their opinion.
Thirty years after the illegal USSR dissolution.
On December the 8th 1991, the biggest geopolitical disaster ever happened.
On December 8th, in Bialowieza Forest, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, with no legal power and violating the results of the referendum held on March 17th 1991, with an open benevolent attitude of Michail S. Gorbačov, in secret, regardless people, signed an agreement that “the USSR no more exists as an international law subject and geopolitical reality”.
Just by one deletion, they “cancelled” a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
After the USSR dissolution, tens of millions of ethincally Russian inhabitants stayed abroad.
Since early 90s, the Russian populations has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless the loss of non-Russian population of former USSR republics, we have lost more people than in both world wars altogether!
Earlier, the same people, who, during one session in Bialowieza Forest destroyed what had been built over the past seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created even at the cost of million of lives during the World War II and Great Patriotic War).
They willfully made deindustralisation, slowed down agriculture, lost fourteen republics that originally belonged to the biggest world power and formed a unique economic mechanism.
If we want to have a deeper look at it, then we can see people becoming poor, economy, science, army decline, decrease of crimes, ethnical conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-soviet world, series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and break of Yugoslavia, Arab spring, the war in Syria – those all are results of geopolitical capitulation, waiver of the socialist camp at first and then the USSR.
In politology, there is a term called “vacuum of power”.
Everything, which was betrayed and left in a hurry, was quickly occupied and conquered by the countries of NATO, which accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world has been shaken up to now mainly because of events which happened at the end of 80s and in early 90s of the 20th century.
The price of a product which is sold at the supermarket at a huge profit doesn't have to correspond to its quality.
It's Monday and at the supermarket, they've got some meat which costs 189,00 CZK / kg.
I buy it and put it in the fridge and want to cook if for dinner on Thursday.
In alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the price will be reduced to 99,00 CZK / kg - describe me the mechanism which will make the meat hard for my digestive system by changing the price of the meat?
Or I wait till Thursday and the price of the meat will be reduced to 69,00 CZK / kg 1 day before its expiry date - by which the meat would differ from what I'd bought on Monday by 120,00 CZK more expensive and left it for 3 days in my fridge?
I'll reply myself - by nothing.
Those bullshit about that if anything is cheap, it's for sure of poor quality, bad or rotten, they're quite stupid, to tell you the truth ;-)
A short time ago, I went to the main station in Brno and a few young girls were giving a brochure in a subway, I usually take such things so that I could help temporary workers, they can't just throw anything away...
Well, the brochure was about common sense and conservative points of view on the world, but there was nothing about the God, I was confused but I had a feeling that it was a kind of campaigning.
After reading that, I found the editor of the brochure and finally I found out that it was the Church of Scientology.
Well, it was not so bad, full of useless propositions, such as I should wash myself and not behave like a moron.
Just a wasting of paper, there's no point in cutting forests because of making anything like that.
I had a similar experience with my former girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to satisfy that person, because you like them and you don't realise what a nervous wreck they are.
She threatened me with hurting herself a few times, just because I went to a pub with a friend of mine who she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to left her flat earlier, she started to cry and asked me being on her knees not to leave.
Then she started to block the door.
Our relation was great for about a year, but after another six months, she became insane.
Then I broke up with her and told her that I was leaving her and that we could have a chat about it later just to calm her so that she didn't get a new nervous attack.
Such a person draws your feeling, emotions and happiness in general.
It's better stay away.
When insurance companies have been stolen by buying billions of tests, and then they quickly urge on positive ones who wouldn't even know about that terrible disease without being tested.
The only thing we've reached is a complication for companies, transport agents and others, just because their employees were accidentally chosen to be isolated at their homes for five days.
They've stopped doing that in western counties and admitted that there's no point in solving a disease which isn't as serious as the flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new there and has to steal something and chase his ego by bullying up.
I see a good old rubbish has returned.
After a few years of slow-down and oppression of that fishy business, MLM recruiting has come back in the glory.
I was one of recruits, I tried the job (I was about 20, 1st university grade), instead of initial promises about product training and business skills they finally said “do not care, just make business”.
I was sincerely interested in products I offered as I wanted to help people, anyway the purpose of those trainings was rather about how to frighten and talk people round.
When I got my first salary, I realised quickly that if I want to earn money, I only have to offer a few certain products per month.
Only investment life insurance and mortgages were profitable, so I could feel like a door-to-door seller of pots finally.
But what I can say is that it was very good experience, I learned that one couldn't take the first job and they must get some information before.
At the same time, I wouldn't judge all of them.
There are successful people doing such business and they even bring benefits to other people, but for sure, they won't boast about expensive consumables or having a “fat” bank account.
I haven't had such experience in the corporation I work for.
HR is all right, managers are in charge of management and don't mind our business.
There's some regular rating, the way it's done is not so bad (you set some targets for the next year and then we'll have a look at your successes and failures) - it's rather a self-evaluation, not that anyone evaluates you according to some figures, etc.
Company events aren't obligatory as well.
But we're a bit specific within the company - there are departments which are more “corporate”.
One has sometimes a feeling that we're a kind of a start-up that squats in offices of a big corporation.
But that works fine, so they don't care about us until there are results of our work.
Missing Czech woman in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
The British police searched with no results for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.

After that, the London police started the search for her, Interpol made her missing worldwide.
She was also in the Czech database of missing people.
The police arrested a man a few days ago.
However, they did not give any information about what the reason for his arrest was and what the man is suspected of.

This is the biggest problem that I've had with the whole pandemic.
Tu put up with the fact that there has appeared quite a dangerous illness, that took me a while at the very beginning, but I could accept it quite easily.
Tu put up with the fact how stupidly most of the population from all social classes have faced the problem, that's much harder to me.
I'm looking (tomorrow!) for vaccination the most because thanks to it I'll be finally less dependable on the fact that other people aren't idiots.
He was deprived from the president position and isn't allowed to get it again.
The chance that he will be successful is really very small, as others comment here.
Besides, I'm not sure if shredding files could be considered as a high treason at all.
I high treason is such an act by which a president of a country puts in danger the state sovereignty, territory integrity or democratic principles.
It would have to be something more serious.
How pandemic has influenced intimate lives: increasing number of people by age 35 without having sex whole year
More and more young people in the US are living without having sex.
Those include mainly people who believe in God, DailyMail reports on their website.
The survey shows that the number of people by age 35 living without sex have increased from 8 to 21 percent between 2008 and 2021.
The number of women between age 18 and 35 who reported having no sex over the past year is still increasing.
According to survey of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS), the decreasing number of sexually active people is also influenced by other circumstances.
One of them may be economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
However, there might be also the influence of media, social networks or video games, which are for young people more important than sex.
“Since 2010, the number of men and women between age 18 and 35 who report having no sex for more than one year has been increasing quickly,” IFS researcher Lyman Stone said.
Married people have sex more frequently, only 5% of them reported having no sex in 2021.
As for single people, it was 29%. Stone added that there was only a small percentage of young people by age 35 who were married.
Less sexual activity may also be influenced by fear from premarital sex and religious motivation.
Although married people are supposed to be more sexually active, the percentage of married people by age 35 has been decreasing.
Young people have different opinions on premarital sex, about 30% consider it unacceptable, while ca 70 % think that it is, on the contrary, acceptable.
“It is truth that there are not many of them within their age category of single people, but their behaviour has been changing this trend,” Stone speaks about those three percent.
Most people who have the moral case for premarital sex believe in God.
Since 2008, the number of young people under age 35 who participate in religious gatherings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among people who “believe less”, the number has increased from 10 to 20 %,” Stone said.
The decrease in sexual activities may be also influenced by other factors, for instance less social interactions and mainly drinking alcohol during the pandemic crisis.
The survey has also shown that unemployed people or people who earn less money are more probable to have no or little sex.
Another reason may be more availability of digital media, which probably cause that people do not need to have much sex.
People spend more time online, which they prefer “doing” instead of having sex.
This trend has spread mainly during the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns.
Obligatory vaccination against covid is problematic as the society would force a part of the population doing what they don't want to do, anyway that might save their lives.
It's quite a difficult question, and I personally have a problem with the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't force them to do that and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that it would be surely our fault if an 80-year-old person who didn't know much about it died, we didn't explain that to them, they got some misinformation, and for those reasons they weren't vaccinated and finally became ill and died.
On the contrary, I don't think that it would be our fault if a stubborn vaccine opponent, who just like SPD and KSČ yell about bullying and a totalitarian state, died.
As we can see from the above mentioned statistics, we can say definitely that most of old pensioners who aren't vaccinated probably belong to the other group, so they cause problems for themselves.
No snow in the Czech Republic.
How will a mild winter influence the fight with drought?
This year, there has been very little snow in the Czech Republic ever.
Ski resort owners have to use technical snow, also preparation of Jizerská padesátka has been complicated by the weather.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And how will so little snow influence the fight with drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about religionists.
One day, when I attended high school, our teacher took us throughout the whole town to the dock to go by boat on the river.
On our way there, we went through a wide street and suddenly we see a person in the middle of the street - a supporter of Hare Krishna.
Of course, they came to us.
I was lucky to escape them, but a friend of mine talked to them.
When she left, I and our teacher asked her what she was saying to them.
“They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I replied I had no soul,” she said.
Everyone, including our teacher, was laughing till the end of our way to the dock.
We are spoiled so much.
The situation is not so bad, but the system has been collapsing, Orozovič says.
On Sunday, after visiting Paris and Brusel, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw, where he was welcomed with military honours by the Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We're starting a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at the joint press conference after their negotiations.
Scholz pointed out that Europe have to demonstrate jointly that they will not accept any violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the alarming movement of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border has, in the Chancellor's opinion, to be solved using diplomatic negotiations, including the “Normandry group” unifying France, German, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, the leader of which Alexandr Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and use people like hard targets and weapons, because we have noticed hundreds of attempts to cross the border illegally every night.
He negotiated with the Chancellor about other sanctions so that Lukashenko regime and his patrons in Kreml would realise finally that we are determined to defend the EU eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw is supported by Germany in their dispute with Belarus, and he condemned inhuman treatment of refugees by Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun causes car crash, trying to conceal
The car returned to the accident scene after a while, however, it was driven by another nun, who tried to take responsibility for herself.
When the police told her that her driving licence could still be revoked for not giving priority to other vehicles and leaving the accident scene, she told them the truth, as TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the car was crashed by the other nun, who asked her for help.
The police went to arrest sister Celestine after that.
She had to take a breath test and after they found out that she had had more than two per mille in her blood, her driving licence was revoked immediately.
At the same time, she was told that she would confess before the court of law.
Dog Hugo does his best
However, Juraj Šajmovič did not master his movie.
Czech authors of family comedies took American pet dog stories as samples.
But they forgot one important thing: the rules of movie industry.
After cheesy movie Gump - pes, který naučil lidi žít by F. Brabec, a new movie Tady hlídáme my has appeared to attract people.
Juraj Šajmovič ml., who is both its author and director, has followed slightly his previous movie Tady hlídám made in 2012.
Again, we can see speaking dachshund Hugo and some other famous characters.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a declining guest house in Šumava, start inviting dog owners, Julia's father with his girlfriend and mainly her daughter Veronika.
She is not a small girl, but a teenager, falling in love for the first time.
The director and his girlfriend Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is the movie producer) had already trouble with dialogues in the previous movie, however the children and the dog were amusing at least there.
They wrote even a worse screenplay this time, which makes feelings of astonishment and awkwardness.
Let's summarize.
Julie, although she is a researcher, want to have a baby so much that she believes guffs and during the right “constellation”, she has sex with her forest engineer Ivan anywhere possible – on a car bonnet or in a church tower (during an excursion with a local guide, of course), former colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter Julie despite his long-term experience, she falls into a coma and then she is taken with her family to hospital, and then she recovers miraculously thanks to a dog in Šumava.
Nothing against the healing power of the nature and pets.
Their owners know well why they keep them.
But a spectator is astonished about what unlikely situations and characters have been used to give them such a message.
A pair of female thieves from staff, the dog owners contest, a charlatan from Šumava, the police officers being called for and searching “drugs” and discussing about herbs and the healing power of bone meal – and which are being drunk by the clever guest house owner.
When the main female character wakes up after being in coma and suddanly, she sits with a new hair style and make-up at the family table, smoking a cigarette and asking for father's whisky and a piece of meat as she is no longer a vegetarian, then we cannot resist laughing.
Besides, the authors explain to spectators that it “sometimes happens after being in coma”.
Šajmovič team lack of basic knowledge of dramaturgical work with text, ability to create crucial situations, sense of characters and point and also the direction itself.
Actor performances are of different quality, the editing is unbalanced and the whole impression is unconvincing.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to act the best way, the screenplay is very weak.
The only positive thing of the movie is poetic images of Šumava nature made by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a couple od dachshunds.
It is not enough to describe a few characters, a weak plot and the dog's comments, let alone traditional swear words used by the characters.
A long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club is not an argument, too - which is the case of the producer.
If one, in good faith, intends to promote the nature and the friendship between human beings and dogs, they also should have to know their ropes if they want to tell a credible story.
Which is not the case of this movie.
There is too much erotics and a minimum feeling for the genre.
This amateur experiment wouldn't be even good as a canistherapy campaign.
Yes, respect, as they have to listen to insults from mother-fuckers like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, it shows that you know shit about it, but it's just because you've nevere tried that.
It's always customer who decides, if they don't want to, then the answer will always be no.
If you didn't listen to such rubbish all the time, then you might change your opinion.
They do the same work as anyone else, as for me, it's a temporary job.
Middle East suffer from extreme droughts.
Winter is, in fact, the only season during which it rains there.
“There was almost no rain in October, as we noticed at some weather stations, that's very unusual,” the Israel Meteorological Service says.
For example, in November, there was only six percent of the long-term average precipitation in Kfar Giladi, a village located in the north of Israel.
So two-day lasting rain was rather an exception in this week.
That's good for us.
It's been long time since it rained here.
It's also the right Christmas atmosphere, Wasím Aškar from Nazareth smiled.
Rainfalls are common in Israel only during winter months, they are rare and not on a regular basis.
Forests are dependable on winter rainfalls.
Otherwise they get dry and there is a danger of fires.
But not only forests, also drinking water supplies and water used in agriculture is very important.
The Sea of Galilee, which is the biggest supply of drinking water in Israel, has filled up to its banks in spring thanks to the last three winters with heavy rainfalls.
However, its level has been declining since then.
Water management experts have warned against droughts ever since.
“We can expect that there will be less rainfalls, depending on the global warming and climate changes,” Uri Schor, the spokeswoman of the Israel Water Management Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
There is even a worse situation is in less developed countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
We can see more and more water tanks in the streets of Jordan, Amman.
Water pipes and private dwells have been drying out.
“This year, I've received by 70 - 80 per cent more orders compared to last two years,” Imád Sulejman, a tank vehicle driver, reported in September.
There were some clashes between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
A local river was completely without any water.
The region has suffered the driest October over the past years.
Israel preparing military strike on Iran
The Izraeli Minister of Defense said that there was no “results” after negotiations in Vienna and that he informed Washington about preparation of military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz sain on Saturday that he ordered Israeli army to increase their pressure on Iran, anyway he also informed Washington about military preparations.
Gantz, who is staying in the U.S.A., is trying to convince the Americans to step their efforts on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna had “no results” and the great powers “understand that the Iranians are taking chances with them”.
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I was giving a young woman a hard time a little bit to find out what exactly she wanted from me.
Finally I found out that my suspicion about the Pyramida was correct.
As I don't like such kind of tricks, I annoyed the girl with doubts and questions for a while and finally I thanked to her and left.
You could call me a bastard, but the Pyramida is what it is and financial consultants are all the same.
Skiers went to mountains at the weekend, there were both enough snow and nice weather.
Ski resorts in the Czech Republic welcomed first load of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowing at the end of the week, there is a lot of snow everywhere and some ski resorts opened thanks to that.
Skiers were not even discouraged when they had to show vaccination certificates at ski lifts.
While ski lift operators cannot complain about lack of customers, some ski equipment rental service report lower demand on their services than it used to be before the pandemic.
Thousands of people went also skiing in Liberecký Region at the weekend.
Skiers were lucky with the weather, it was sunny today and there were great conditions for skiing.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend was a real success since Friday when there were first people skiing in the mountains,” Jakub Hanuš, director of Ski Resort Ještěd, was happy.
Hundreds of people went also skiing in Jeseníky Mountains the first time in this season.
Ski resort Ski Aréna Karlov or Branná in Šumpersko opened as well.
Many people came, around 400,000 people came on Saturday and today, too.
There were great conditions.
It was sunny today, around three degrees below zero, so it was great, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of ski resort Branná, was happy.
Ski resort operators can sell ski passes only to those who have been vaccinated or if they had covid a short time ago.
With exceptions, people are prepared to it and they show required documents, René Hroneš from ski resort Špindlerův Mlýn told ČTK.
“There were only a few conflicts,” he added.
Some rental services and ski equipment shops report lower demand on ski equipment compared to the situation before the pandemic.
Luckily, people are interested in borrowing skis.
It's not the same as it used to be in the past, but we've still had enough customers, Alexandra Bokišová from shop Skiopava said.
They expect more people during ski courses.
Also David Šinták, the CEO of company Snowbear in Hradec Králové, thinks that people are less interested in borrowing ski equipment due to the coronavirus pandemic.
This time before the pandemic, most of our equipment had been borrowed by people.
It's less by about 50 % compared to the situation before the pandemic, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazier and they got used to staying at home.
On the contrary, rental service in ski resort Novako at Boží Dar report a huge demand.
They started lending ski equipment a week ago, and people have to order it in advance.
“We start to lend cross-country skis this weekend, but people called long time before, so we are expecting a great interest, just like last year,” Pavlína Nováková, the ski resort operator, said.
According to her, people are also still interested in ski training, which is the same as before the pandemic.
If we want to make sure that successful and wealthy people won't leave the country, they must have chances to live their lives of the same quality as abroad.
Which is not surely socialistic healthy service when one can't find a dentist or a medical specialist.
Smart and skillful people who aren't wealthy go abroad.
A company owner won't probably leave the country.
But I agree completely with other things.
If such people won't live quality lives in the Czech Republic and those people won't have a vision of a good future, then they won't stay in the Czech Republic.
People started to emigrate from Hungary after one day Orban had won elections, he ruled for one year and suddenly, the number of emigrants increased by a few tens of thousands per year.
We'd be naive if we thought that there couldn't be the same situation in the Czech Republic by the day.
Elections is another question.
If people don't have good conditions for living here, then one day, an insane might also win elections.
Young and educated people will leave the country, only his supporters will stay and then people who are too rich to quit with all their wealth.
Terryfying photo!
Langmajer covered with blood because of the bet on beer?
Being autumn under the way in the Czech Republic, the Ostrov movie crew with Jiří Langmajer (55) headed up were enjoying a tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor shared a picture of his face covered with blood on social networks.
Is the wound real, or is it just make-up because of making a movie?
London police still investigates missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra's missing is unlike her behaviour and we've started worrying about her very much,” Lucy O'Connor from Lambeth police department, where Srncová worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic have also much worried about her, and they just want to know where she is,” she added.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at 7:45PM on Sunday, October 28th, and went home to the district of Camberwell.
She was reported to be last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
One of her co-workers told the police about her missing on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a “nurse assistant” in Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital union Guy's and St Thomas'.
“We're so much worried about our dear co-worker Petra, who is missing,” the group of medical facilities wrote on Twitter.
“We'd like to appeal to anyone who could give any information that might help find her that they contact the police,” it was written in their post.
Also deputy Hariett Harman has called on the public when she talked about Srncová case during the press conference on Saturday.
“She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years, she comes from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, extremely worried about her,” the Labor Party's politician said while showing a picture of the woman, distributed by London police.
“It's my feeling that we all have a big responsibility and should try to find her, because she was out of her country, far from her family and worked for our health service,” Harman said.
In connection with the case, the police had earlier arrested a man who has still been kept in custody.
According to BBC web, the police have neither given any information concerning his identity nor what that man has been suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, surely not with just 30 BTG (that is about 5 divisions).
Not even me underestimates Ukraine like that.
That's not just a “huge amount”, but ca 8 per cent of the Russian army.
Just notice that Ukraine has repeated that we exaggerate the menace of an invasion and it's started to being fed up with our intervention.
I quoted that at the top.
I don't know why do you think that Russia wants a war.
A war is extremely expensive and Russia's GDP is at the same level as of Italy.
To compare the situation with the situation in 1938 is so much out of the picture that I don't even know with what I should start talking.
It's just as if I compared that with the 1st Punic War and “annexation” of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine had announced that it wouldn't meet the Minsk Agreement's, Russia will annex all those small states.
That's all I wanted to say, and that's what the “concentration” at the borders would respond to.
As they say, pacta sunt servanda...
New public transport timetables valid in Prague from Sunday, including mainly suburban transport
A few changes await Prague integrated transport (PID) passengers starting on Sunday, including mainly suburban transport.
New lines have been launched, some of them have been changed or even cancelled.
Mladoboleslavský Region has started to participate in the integrated system.

Healthy snack / lunch from supermarket in office
Hi, I work standard hours from 9-5 having a 30-minute break and I can only buy some food in Billa, which is next door, or Lidl, which is a bit farther.
Given that I don't have much exercise and after work, I'm to tired to do some, I must only eat healthy and diet food.
Unfortunately, I never know what I shall buy and as I'm in a hurry, I only buy some pizza buns and some yoghurt and an apple for snack.
Question: what healthy food which doesn't need to be cooked would you recommend me buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately, it's like that.
And not speaking about trees that you have to see necessarily.
There might be hidden just a top of a tree under snow.
If it's damaged, the tree might be predisposed to fungus disease.
I don't say it's just only reason why they don't allow us to ski outside the downhill, but it's one of them.
Dara confessed to her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to it at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbusiness world has been talking about nothing but disclosure of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Now Dara sent a long message to her fans, explaining why she concealed her love for such a long time.
“I can say that at the moment, there's no one both in the Czech and Slovak Republic who wouldn't know that Dara “hunted a bear”, or exactly, Nedvěd,” Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player, made a joke.
But she says it was him who picked her up.
They have been centre-stage for three days, and as they are both used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it comes.
Something we didn't look forward to, but we knew that it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's in a worse situation.
If those who aren't interested in it at all, but they can see and hear about us everywhere, or we whose lives are discussed in details openly.
As if anyone of you one wanted to hear if you and your boy- or girlfriend are a good couple, or if you insisted that everyone would have a list of your ex-partners and knew of all your mistakes and weaknesses.
That's really great, just what you want, Dara is annoyed.
The couple started their relationship in Italy where Dara came to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd was there as a long-term Juventus Vice-president.
They did not tell the truth about their relationship earlier, as they waited for Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana were separated for three years, however, they got divorced officially three weeks ago.
Anyway, we thank to those who are happy about us and wish that to us.
We're also only human, we've got our families, children past and also dreams.
We aren't perfect, but I think that we both have got hearts in the right places.
Also for that reason, I love my new boyfriend and I support him just as he supports me. For better or worse, Rolins said.
Hi, other commenters have said what they wanted to say, I just confirm that the halls of residence have been great since the beginning, my classmates usually met new people and made friends during the first semester and they found lodgings later, which is, in my opinion, the best solution, as you know who you will share a room with.
There aren't usually many adverts on flats in advance, so at the moment, you won't probably find any, anyway you can go through ads, it's worth it.
Make sure that you won't go to Cejl and the vicinity (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská etc., these places have a very bad reputation), and also some parts of Židenice are a bit like ghettos.
On the contrary, Veveří is popular with students, Královo pole and that direction is fine, and besides, it's close to most VUT colleges (I don't know in which you will be).
I've never looked for any lodgings, but I'm a native from Brno, so I can advise you if you need some more information :)
That's a very nice example of quite “normal” thinking.
Because a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do that, it's all right that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either they should teach what they want and pay for that themselves, or they should teach what the states says and it's paid by the state.
We can't still let a private partaker gain control over a part of the education system just because that there will be some more money to state funds and they could teach at schools whatever they want.
Such a claim is a bit weak if it's written by a person who talked like that about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state two days ago:
So if anyone has an abortion and you're against it, is it the same situation as if you were against building a statue on a square?
If I were you, I'd consult it directly with that person who gave the work to you.
Well, I had such experience while doing cataloging/digitalisation that (and even experts who have been doing that work for a long time) they either make an approximate estimate or note down something like xxx *** or ... (as usual) and they add a comment that it's not readable.
It's truth that in this case it's quite readable, so I wouldn't recommend that.
Personally, I'd probably make a comment, depending on what programme you use.
If you wanted to be a proper and hardworking student, you could go through some emblem databases and find out the most similar one.
But as if it looks like that you get information from a book, I'd bet that the author or printer simply made their own emblem which is similar to what's there on the coin.
PS: Isn't it Odryská Empire (Kingdom) rather than Odrynská Empire?
PSS: Someone has solved that here.
See the comment including ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't have a clue what the main “topic” of the Czech EU presidency will be.
That's much worse than the fact that they will take interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve anything as nobody understood their speech is funny.
All important documents to be approved are read word by word, one need to have excellent knowledge of English, that's in charge of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, politicians use English rather during informal negotiations, to get some more important contacts.
Besides, the situation about English is quite interesting at the moment, after the Brexit.
I don't understand the hate about Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I haven't had any troubles.
I often goes home at 10 PM and there have never been any problems.
Only person who has never been there can call it a ghetto.
Yes, most gypsy population of Brno live there, but they don't harm anyone, they just block pavements and park where it's not allowed :D But for sure, I'm not afraid to go there at night.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap lodgings with a good access to the center, then you should try that.
Many flats have been newly reconstructed or built there.
Felix Slováček (78) completely alone without Dáda and his mistress Gelemová!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people burnt the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I haven't any Advent wreath, so there was no candle to be burnt.
I saw Dáda's wreath and Lucie surely has some, too, the saxophonist said to Blesk, and thus he confirmed what Patrasová had said, that he often visited her.
He visits her, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady where Dada stayed alone after he left.
Slováček still does not know where he will spend Christmas Eve.
We met Anička, Felix and both grand-sons a short time ago.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we talked about something all the time, so we didn't speak about Christmas at all.
I don't really know, where I will be.
I buy gifts throughout the hole year and for sure, I will buy something for Dáda and Lucie, perhaps some perfumes.
I'm a gentelman, Felix, who came to Richman club to launch a new music video, said.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel lonely.
I always find someone who I can have a nice chat with, Slováček says, and he was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that absolutely clear.
Are we Iceland that we could afford not having any soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will be willing to defend us and we're located so strategically that an aggressor would be an idiot if they didn't occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, please try to explain to me.
I don't know any other service that could be used in crisis at hospitals.
We've got few police officers and they can't do that, of course, we've got many firefighters and there aren't so many skilled people who are able to provide medical services of such quality anywhere in the world.
And the fact that our army is able to defend maybe Ostrava and that's all, it's our previous governments' fault, they've been asking for new equipment since long.
Record-breaking drought in the CR.
It is necessary that we change donations to agriculture, the landscape is not just a factory for manufacturing food, a journalist says.
There has been a record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic over the past years.
According to experts, there has been less water in mountains and submontane areas, and a small precipitation has affected even areas which have never suffered from droughts.
Thd reason for droughts that have been in most parts of central Europe is the climate change.
But there is another reason, too, the way we treat the earth.
What should we be prepared for when there are droughts?
And how can we help the nature in such difficult situations?
Yeah, that's it, I can't almost ice-skate, I don't know anything about ice-hockey and the tactics (which I tried to play in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also very weak.
And either you're an ice-hockey team “mědvěd Rusko” or “lama Čína”, it's different if you lose by two goals although you don't have to win a game necessarily, or if the game is tight.
But in all cases, as I listen to Czech broadcasters who points out what coaches notice or don't, either men' or women's ice-hockey, that's all strange, but it's probably same in every sport, the UEFA and “Italští herci” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
There's controversy everywhere.
And if it were different, it would be as usual, and that the Czech Republic has been defeated by Russia more often than won, we could hear as usual “they lost” vs “WE won”.
Coronavirus: The number of infected people has reached 10 million in Russia.
On Saturday Dec 11th, there have been 9,080 new cases per day in the Czech Republic.
5,766 patients are in hospitals.
34,451 people died in total in the Czech Republic, other 74.
There have been 1,967 new confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the Czech Republic over last 14 days and 871 cases per 100,000 people over the last week.
On Sunday, the number of infected people has reached 10 million in Russia.
There have been reported 29,929 new cases over the last 24 hours.
That has been lowest number per day since October 13th.
The total number of reported cases has been 10,016,896 in Russia.
The number of deceased people is 1,132 per day, which has been the lowest number since the end of October.
Great Britain has faced an “inevitably” huge wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant, as doctor Susan Hopkins, the main medical consultant for the UK Health Security Agency, said on TV on Sunday.
Some new quarantine regulations will be necessary.
People infected by the Omicron variant have been taken to hospital in Great Britain and Hopkins expects that the number will increase.
So far, nobody has died of the Omicron variant, however people are sent to hospital in about 14 days after being infected and they die in about three weeks after being infected.
Keir Starmer, the leader of the British Labor Party, said on Sunday that Boris Johnson probably broke the law when he made a Christmas quiz in Downing Street during the last December lockdown, although there was a ban on Christmas parties.
One of ministers of Johnson's government opposed that the quiz, in fact, had been made “virtually”, online.
However, Downing Street staff participated in it and they gathered around computers.
In Great Britain, Johnson has faced demands to resign from his Prime minister post.
Last December, when there was a strict lockdown in London and there was a ban on Christmas parties, despite the lockdown, Johnson's ministers made various parties.
The British people and media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, an editor for commercial television ITV in Britain: This day two years ago, Boris Johnson overhelmingly won the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party says that he should resign.
It's notable how quickly things have changed.
Do you want to change your mind and save your life?
In spring, new elections will be held in Hungary, which could discontinue Victor Orban's 12-year rule.
Those elections will be important for the whole EU.
How much can we expect that they will be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will not be probably democratic as well, as last two Orban's elections were not democratic, too.
His party Fidesz controls media, change electoral district borders so that he could benefit from that, and they make other more or less cheats.
The last one has been that everyone can vote from anywhere.
That enables Fidesz drive voters from districts where results are certain to those ones where results are uncertain and where they might be defeated by their opponents.
So I just repeat that the elections will not be fair at all.
Do you think that it will be as unfair as between years 2014 and 2018?
The situation has completely changed.
Before, it was not going on that Fidesz would win elections, but with what results they would win and if they would have a constitutional majority.
Now, there is a real chance that the united opposition will receive more votes and mandates.
That's very unusual for Victor Orban and his party.
Will they be even tougher trying to keep power?
Yes, we can see some signs that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
A short time ago, independent media published a record of the parliament chairman and Lászlóa Kövéra, one of Fidesz' leaders, in which he was telling the secret intelligence service directors that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the signs of new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of that news.
Everything starts with a language.
I was spanked quite often, last time when I was 14, Mom isn't particularly patient, neither am I, Dad is very patient, but suddenly he flares up extremely (just because of me).
I'm also very choleric and I was enraged as a small child, to the extent that I lied on the floor and turned blue, I was even given a shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes, they just gave me a smack, and sometimes, they spanked me because they didn't know what else they should do.
Definitely, I also tend to solve things the same way, I quite scuffled as a child, now as an adult and when I'm angry, I just hit something to calm down, when I was a child, I hit my parents' hands or so (in order not to get beat up), so nothing extreme, but I always feel like doing similar things.
I can't say what role my quick temper plays, but for sure, my parents' upbringing has also influenced that.
I'm afraid of losing my temper with my children and spanking them, too.
I think that spanking children is bad and that parents shouldn't do that, especially if they are frustrated and don't know what else they should do, on the other hand, probably all parents might botch up something at least once in their lives, they are sometimes a bit tough with their children, so I don't even blame them of that.
It doesn't offend me anyhow, I don't see why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and definite.
I would call mother-fuckers those who make laws of such poor quality.
And I'd like to know if you're afraid of losing your job and getting no salary?
Can one really suppose that people want and buy the product and you'll be able to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's hideous world.
Where will Slovak get by the trial with the journalist Kuciak's murderers?
Proceedings against four men accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová have started in Slovak.
The deaths of the investigative journalist and his girlfriend have changed Slovak.
They have stirred up the society, but they have also revealed the machinations of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his contacts with the most influent Slovak politicians and judiciary.
Will the proceedings turn Slovak significantly?
This is mainly journalists' fault.
How is it possible that they wrote about that petition much more than the anti-petition of all medical faculties deans which was issued one or two days later?
Of course, they put up with that and the society paid for that.
On ČT, people still died of covid half a year ago.
Another government close to end and there is still no law on involvement of municipalities in repository selection
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be revised completely.
Andrej Babiš' governement is close to an end and the law which should ensure respect for municipality interests and their citizens when selecting and allowing deep repositories for highly radioactive waste has not still been approved.
Legislative Council of the Government stopped the proposal discussion, which was submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its contents is in contradiction not only with those municipalities united in Platforma against deep repositories, but also with Svaz měst a obcí ČR.
Local governments expect that the law will strengthen their powers regarding the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the government started to prepare it and which is also require by the Czech nuclear law and a European regulation.
We expect that the new government, based on their agreement on coalition, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal, which Platforma has had, is criticised for mainly: the proposed extent of how much municipalities and public can influence selection of the repository location is insufficient and cannot make respect for municipality and their citizens interests.
It can be only effective if municipalities or public will be able to influence if the process will continue or not in the area.
That can be ensured by imposing an obligation to the Repository Management to ask for the municipality approval before any procedure will start.
The submitted proposal of the subject intention almost omits the possibility of the public influence and make citizens just statistic figures during authorisation procedures.
There is also no provision concerning compensations for municipalities in the proposal in the whole procedure of search and selection of the repository location, its authorisation and operation.
Nowadays, municipality representatives do not have many legal possibilities how they could protect their citizens' interests when searching the repository location.
They can comment or appeal only in some authorisation procedures, however, it is the authority or minister who decides about the issue of the permit.
Any legal action has no suspensive effect on the performance of exploration or construction works.
The participation in the decision-making of local governments required by Platforma is a common principle used in many democratic countries and definitely in those where the authorisation of the repository has been developed, e.g. in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which outsources legal offices to prepare legislative matters.
In this case, it is the agreement, and related agreements, with legal office HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. which SÚRAO concluded with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for the works is, acording to the agreement registry, almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-mayor of Cejle in Hrádek and Platforma's spokesman against deep repositories said: We are waiting for a change for the better made by the new government after ministers of industry, who only postponed the improvement of local governments position against state bodies when searching deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors.
We are offering a helping hand.
We also thank Svaz měst a obcí for their support, which also considers the problem with insufficient powers of municipalities the same way as we do, and also the villages concerned in those localities.
Platforma against deep repository includes 51 members (35 villages and towns and 16 organisations) who make effort to change the state's attitudes to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste management, which will not be only applied to deep repositories.
Platforma also wants that decisions on selection of repository locations must be first approved by villages concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced by fear to lose weight: he lost 90 kilos.
Although he has not had to change his lifestyle for many years, he was finally frightened by physicians.
They told him that he would die unless he lose weight.
And that worked.
Goodman lost 90 kilos step by step, which is half of his previous weight 180 kilos, The Sun reports.
He showed his new figure proudly in Los Angeles at first night of animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fatty one from sitcom Roseanne has become a new person!
John liked to make jokes that his family and friends asked him to lose weight because his huge body caused furniture cracking.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in 2018 during an interview with AARP.
This time, I wanted to do that slowly.
To move, to do exercises.
Now I am at the age when I cannot afford just sitting, Goodman said to ABC, his transformation is amazing.
It's also important what kind of word “boss” and in what you want to use it.
If it's just a text on platform that has readers from the field of gambling I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it's, let's say, a formal text and for university readers, I would search how to describe the word boss.
Moreover, there are more kinds of bosses.
E.G. there are several bosses in game called Dark Souls etc., right, so a “boss” is someone like a lord / rule of a certain level, and then there's a top boss...
There are hidden bosses in many games (super boss, hidden boss), who you don't even have to defeat so that the game or a level would be over, but they're usually even more powerful than a standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, in which there are bosses, but a player doesn't fight with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so can we call them like bosses at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
So the word boss has different meanings, it's not so difficult in Czech language or other languages (Catalan is interesting, the word boss is sometimes translated as a final opponent).
It's just important for a story or a game, it's controlled by a computer, the opponent is much stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
Missing Petra from London searched by whole world.
Also the Czech police participates.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since December 3rd.
Also the Czech police have participated.
They have been searching the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7th.
They help the British police via Interpol.
Czech woman Petra Srncová was last seen by her co-workers on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
The so-called yellow memo was issued by Interpol because of her.
So the missing Czech woman is being searched by the whole world.
“The Czech police cooperates closely with the British police,” Kateřina Rendlová, the police spokeswoman, confirmed.
“We share the information related to the case,” she added.
The search for Petra has appeared on the police website.
She is said to be of 168 cm height, she is slim and she has got brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She probably comes from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Her friends and co-workers worry about her, as her disappearance is not very typical of her.
Also local deputy Harriet Harman has participated in the search for Petra.
She has helped with the distribution of leaflets showing Petra's face.
„We worry about her very much,“ she said at Saturday's press conference.
In connection to Petra's missing, the British police have arrested a suspect.
However, it is not clear what the identity of the man is and what he had to do with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorised by Agent Tesla
While there was a slight decrease of targeted attacks in October, there was, on the contrary, a great increase of them last month as the year is close to an end.
We noticed a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks have been targeted to the Czech Republic.
The hackers strategy has been still the same.
An infected attachment of an e-mail should attract the user by its name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While the dangerous attachment contained word “invoice” in its name last month, this time it was Copy of invoice corrections in 11,2021...exe,” Martin Jirkal from Eset says.
Spyware contains functions which scan Internet browsers and other programmes, e.g. e-mail clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malware code actively search saved logins, which are subsequently sent to hackers.
The last strong campaign in the Czech Republic took place at the turn of August/September, and there has been an increase of hackers attack as the year is close to an end.
Also spyware Formbook remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, hackers do not aim at the Czech Republic in particular in this case and security experts noticed rather global campaigns in November.
Compared to October, Formbook became slightly weaker in November, however, it has still been the main cause of almost one fifth of all detections.
There were attacks within the whole month on a regular basis, especially on October the 3rd, 10th and 15th.
Formbook contained in most cases an attachment with .exe suffix, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
There still appears “receipt” in the name.
A Czech attachment can be far more dangerous to a Czech user.
Security experts have monitored a significant decrease and lower activity in programme Fareit, which made up 1,6 % of attacks and it has not had any big attack campaign in the Czech Republic over the past month.
The nowadays democracy of clever fellows who don't need oxygen, as oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The Prague procession was even bigger than reported by media.
According to taken shots as the procession was going along the riverbank and according to my experience as a protester, I'd say there were even 10,000 people.
The people in the procession overcrowded the riverbank and the bridge and also the opposite riverbank road.
That means, there are lots of people, indeed.
And much more passers-by are spontaneously joining the procession made of about 4,000 protesters.
I say that something new has been born here, Radek Mokrý writes.
That's because a few big groups of people or classes haven't been satisfied for a long time, which has made them cooperate closely.
Just anti-vaxxers, face mask opponents etc. wouldn't be able to make and pay such a big procession.
The campaigns of the organisation Chcípl pes have been more and more popular with people, they remind me of Milión chvilek for anti-democracy.
It's sometimes my feeling that they rent the same stage and technical equipment.
It's hard to say what organisation could be made up from that dissatisfaction, not only funding is important, but also whether there will be four or more vaccine doses by Pfizer instead of three ones.
Definitely, the movement will be neither left-wing or central, you can bet.
For sure, there will be more than three doses of vaccine needed, as it's obvious that we will have to be vaccinated every half a year.
I'm happy that vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant step made by researches human beings can be rightly proud of.
End of deadlock, new Bulgarian Prime Minister proclaims change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev appointed Kiril Petkov from an anti-corruption movement We keep on changing, which won the November election, to form the new government.
He has managed to formulate the new government of broad coalition which is to take office in a few days.
There has been a political crisis in the country since April when the former government lost the election after many anti-corruption protests.
However, winning parties proclaiming anti-corruption fight and power abuse had not been able to make an agreement about anything, so there took place two other early elections.
What cats do when nobody watches them?
“Secretly” taken videos have become a global smash hit.
At the weekend, people in Britain have concerned more and more about a 32-year-old Czech woman who had been searched by London police for a few days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was on her way home in the south of the British capital city.
Any information about the children nurse is beside the police requested also by her employee or female deputy for the part of London where she lived.
“Petra's missing is unlike her behaviour and we've worried about her very much,” Lucy O'Connor from the police department in district Lambeth, where Srncová worked, said in her Saturday video spot.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also much worried about her and they just want to know where she is” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her work on Sunday 28 November at about 7:45 PM and went home in district Camberwell.
She was reported to be last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her missing was announced by one of her co-workers on 3rd December.
According to British media, Srncová worked as “nursing assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We worry so much about our dear co-worker Petra who has been missing,” the hospital facilities group shared on twitter.
“We would like to ask anyone who has any information that could help find her to call the police,” they said.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumperk (and also the regional councilwoman from Piráti Party), has been reported by an anonymous of copyright infringement made by her paintings.
However, the court decided that she does not break the law by her paintings of Krteček.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road, which meant a culvert without a lid.
It was a matter of life and death.
The town municipality forwarded the complaint to the ŘSD, which is the road owner, and as they did not react, the hole was still there.
Finally, both authorities had a discussion about their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD started to “solve the situation intensively”.
