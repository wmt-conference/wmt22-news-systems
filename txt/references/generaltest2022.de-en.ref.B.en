The merchandise was less than 20 EURO.
The fee corresponds with 40 % of the goods’ value...
I am a major client of #PRS_ORG# and thus it is no problem for me.
I need only a number or instructions for what to attach to the package so you could track the return with that.
A few days ago I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for € 249.
Today the item costs € 179.
To be honest, I find this very unfair.
Do I have to cancel the order and order it again for the better price or is there another possibility via voucher?
I principally believe also one should not expect from children that they take on the role of a parent for their smaller siblings.
I like, however, that it is also good for older siblings to take care of the smaller ones but in moderation.
To look after them, to help out briefly, to provide the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn how to take on responsibility, support the family and take part of it.
As long as they themselves can still remain to be kids, I see no problem with that.
If your kid K1 busies him/herself for a short time and he/she is happy with it, then this is also good.
You can judge for yourself whether this suits your children well.
It is certainly not the case that he/she should put diapers on K2 or watch it at sleeping time for hours.
Under legal aspects this probably questionable.
Perhaps this explains the psychologist’s statement.
In case something should really occur such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, invasion of aliens etc. then it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is now a risk that you would like to take is at your own discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember that I have read a thriller years ago and I still remember clearly almost the entire plot, however, the title will not come to mind for anything, perhaps somebody here knows about it...
The story deals with angst and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring the animal feed about his body and then enters the enclosure to his feline predators.
The case is investigate by a female police inspector who, after a short investigation, contacts his therapist who runs a clinic in which he treats angst patients.
The inspector has a young niece who suffers from angst (of fire) and who lands at this therapist’s clinic.
More suicides occur and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously hired before each suicide to go to the site of the suicide, to document it and display the photos in the Internet.
At any rate it is finally revealed that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy-group where they plant a chip in the patients which suppresses an angst center in the brain and causes the patients to finally face their angst in most extreme ways.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another one drives herself intentionally to death)
Facing your angst is described in the book as “the fight”.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with fire.
That is about the plot in a nutshell and I am quite sure that it was a French author who wrote the original book.
In case somebody knows about the story or if somebody can actually tell the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don’t have the password for the Wlan available.
Must first contact my husband.
That might take a while.
How do I proceed from there?
Is it also possible to have the price difference be remitted?
Child, 4 y., splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, had wooden splinters under the thumb nail (outside) across the entire length.
I tired to pull it out with a pair of tweezers.
Was difficult to grasp.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child becomes hysterical when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we’ll see a doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccinations
Constantly new cases of Omikron infections worry politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore all qualifying adults in England should be offered booster vaccination until New Year.
London - The British prime minister Boris Johnson wants to advance the Corona booster vaccinations even faster than previously targeted due to the rapidly increasing Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity already to year’s end to receive a booster dose as long as at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, said Johnson on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
So far the target date was until the end of January.
The British government would offer additional support so that vaccination campaigns would also be accelerated in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Omikron variant would call for an emergency and therefore the vaccinations must urgently be pushed ahead, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protective level could be increased again with a third vaccination.
“Go and get boostered!”, said Johnson.
On Sunday 1239 additional Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, that raised the total numbers to 3137.
Compared to the day before this was an increase of unbelievable 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor that all introduce themselves with first names
I send in an application.
Today I received an invitation for an interview via mail.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not “Peter” but a somewhat complicated name.
I googled the name and according to his/her cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how I should write the email now.
Can somebody help me please?
** I am a foreigner and don’t want to insult a civil servant.
Conclusion: everybody should introduce him/herself with first name.
I have 5 books altogether listed there.
4 are working.
Only the one I bought today doesn’t work
Obviously the chair had a non-evident defect when it was sold.
How else can otherwise such a material defect occur after 9 months?
I tried it first on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that does not longer work since
about 14 days.
Therefore I bought the most recent books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG#, but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and then bill me for that.
[CW] The feeling when I can’t help.
Content-Warning: I will write here about domestic violence in more details.
I have to simply write it off my chest.
I (21) am, for professional reasons, more frequently in contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
A subject that goes straight to my heart and that unfortunately occurs much too frequently namely that many victims don’t seek help or think we cannot help them.
I am totally aware that we cannot do everything and that we are not perfect.
But in my job there are fewer things that move me more than when I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in talks in private, the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach out to all.
I don’t know the reasons for it perhaps it is angst, fear of revenge, fear to leave the familiar social environment, fear to rip the children out of it.
What I want to make clear for all, partially myself close to tears, everybody deserves to be able without violence.
I would like to see that all women know that they don’t have to simply tolerate violence.
I frequently wished I could help in every case...I know that I can’t do that.
But that doesn’t make things any easier.
Please, always remember you are worth living without violence, that is the most important message.
“Arcane” on Netflix: How good is the series “League of Legends”?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least the youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: Within not even three months the Riesen lost in Crailsheim for the second time - and how!
Looking back to the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins at the beginning of October Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said before the game: “We still have some anger in us”.
That anger, however, did not disappear after the game - but rather increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby it was more the kind of performance that disappointed than the naked result.
Representative might be statistics that describe the entire dilemma: The three point ratio was just 13 percent, 4 scores (all from the young Johannes Patrick) for - believe it or not - 31 attempts - still any questions?
The answer comes from John Patrick: “After the victory in Teneriffa we were simply not concentrated enough and we didn’t implement what we trained for”.
Namely to move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted much differently: “A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time”, said the happy coach.
“It felt like playing for 10000 people”.
On Saturday there were only 750 spectators admitted in the Hohenlohe arena, but they got their money’s worth.
Also not least because of the BBL top scorer T. J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed his team’s game.
“The best key player I’ve ever coached”, added Gleim in praise.
While in Patrick’s team even key players such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only during the last quarter (22:15) the Riesen prevented a total debacle and closed in up to eight points after they had trailed already 39:59.
Beside Johannes Patrick Justin Simon still scored twelve points.
Fortunately there is not much time for singing the blue.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the Riesen host the Skyliners Frankfurt in front of also 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
we had a different email address earlier, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported it already several months ago.
Then all warranty claims were unfortunately declined.
We obtained legal advice once more and therefore we have written to you again.
Originally we reported this to you already half a year ago.
Always spick and span: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to excite his audience with his new interpretations of pop songs from the 20ies and 30ies.
Currently he is on tour with the program “Guten Tag, liebes Glück” (good day dear love) - if and when he is allowed to perform.
Actually Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - “by order of the authorities”, to contain the Corona virus.
Also other performances, planned for the Advent time, must first of all be cancelled, as the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and of his musicians states (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January on the artists want to make up for the events that were postponed already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine Westphalian Lünen; already as teenager Max enjoyed singing.
In Berlin he studied singing opera, 1986 he founded - together with fellow students - the Palast Orchester.
Ever since then the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of pop songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded with many prices.
His live album from the “MTV Unplugged” series (2019) ranked second place in the charts - as his successful album “Für Frauen ist das kein Problem” (Women have no problem with that) (2013).
From the niche he has reached the mainstream.
Always clad elegantly, the blond hair strictly combed back and aware of etiquettes, the current German speaking music landscape can no longer be imagined without Max Raabe.
With the program “Guten Tag, liebes Glück” he is on tour since 2020. dpa
Hi #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It should supplement already existing furniture and thus we could check whether it would complement the colors
It still doesn’t work, I can only see the cover page but not page through it.
Federal Secretary of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriations do not create new domiciles
The new Secretary of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) spoke out against the expropriations of large housing companies as it is demanded in a people’s referendum in Berlin.
“Expropriation does not create one single new apartment it only changes the ownership structure”, said Geywitz in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My intentions are to give tenants security that their rent remains payable during the next few years.
And by the way, a wide mixture e. g. of lessors, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the forming of monopolies.
The coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party wants to establish an expert commission in Berlin to find out how to handle the results of the referendum.
If the situation cannot be diffused Geywitz did not exclude talks especially with the FDP in the ample coalition about further tightening the tenancy law.
The coalition contract intends a rent control till 2029, a limitation of rent increases in the tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental index.
I will talk to the Secretary of Justice to implement that as fast as possible.
If the rental market does nevertheless not quiet down “we will talk about further steps with our coalition partners”, emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead through tornados in Kentucky
Numerous tornados ploughed through the USA in a devastating storm system.
In Kentucky alone there might be more than 100 fatalities.
The images from there resemble a war zone.
In the night to Saturday several tornados at once caused devastating damages and probably up to one hundred fatalities in the USA.
The storms left an about 320 kilometer long aisle of devastation, in particular in the state of Kentucky.
Kentucky’s governor Andy Beshear said after his visit to the disaster zone: everything is gone where the tornados touched down.
Houses, businesses, official buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He anticipates up to hundred fatalities in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers climb by the hour.
Hi, I have just noticed that the showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That is unfortunate.
Will it still be produced?
Or has it removed from the assortment entirely?
Is there a possibility to order the showcase in another country?
until when do you contact me?
If the items are not delivered to my apartment I must cancel the order !
That I understand, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, the one that is in the shopping cart?
Via the contact form I returned an article or rather I posted a return, and I wanted to inquire whether it has arrived or whether it will be processed since I still haven’t received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government still declines proposals for vaccination bonuses companies in Austria took themselves the initiative and offer financial bonuses to their employees for vaccination.
Thus they streamline with their social partners ÖGB and the chamber of commerce which today demanded financial incentives for the vaccination.
Also redesigning advertising slogans for vaccination appeals - according to German examples - should increase the willingness for Corona vaccinations.
He changed to a company which he had badmouthed prior to that.
That make his situation not better than yours.
Wait and see.
This was a year ago.
He obviously wasn’t obliged to stay in his old job, so he looked for something else.
You may do the same.
And that he didn’t like you much then: well no matter.
He neither liked his old job.
There are too many variables.
Please, accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I’ll prepare a screen shot.

Help for a first own campaign
Boron salute!
I manage currently the adventure across the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly in a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great plot has been achieved, the villains and their motivations written, the individual actions thought through and now I am up to writing the entry adventure and I stumble over my own feet already with the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes ought to bring a carriage with wheat from Grabenfels into a small village close to the lake Thuran.
There another action should develop.
Some miles from the village a group of Goblins is supposed to ambush the group.
I would like to give the player characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in several ways: Convincing, acting, threatening, to recognizing danger early, whatsoever comes to the players mind.
Group size: 8 common Goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
When unnoticed the goblins bushwhack the heroes in a ravine and flank it armed with bows to the left and right three on each side while two with spears stop the carriage.
Should it come to a fight and the heroes succumb I offer two possible solutions
1. The heroes drop all unconscious and will subsequently be found and healed by the son of the village major, a semi-elf.
The carriage is of course gone.
2. Should a defeat unavoidable the mentioned semi-elf with two of its servants interferes and comes to rescue the heroes in their fight.
The carriage is still there, all is great.
How feasible is solution 2 in Deus ex Machina?
Is the encounter as entry to the adventure too much?
The group of Goblins will later on play a decisive role, they are not only cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, in particular not with so many brilliant proposals and hints.
I will certainly follow many of your ideas and feel now more confident in my narrative.
I have dismantled the lamp once more.
And then put it back together again.
Unfortunately it still doesn’t work.
Therefore I would like to return it nevertheless
Could you send me the return labels then I will package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Sky Sport F1 gets on my nerves
Hi dear F1-Fans, the quality on the German Sky decreased more and more in the course of the season so that I want to ventilate a bit with this post.
Today, in the middle of the F2-race the transmission was aborted for the first time to let the F1-pre-reporting begin on time.
The time plan was way behind planning caused by a delayed start and the accident at the start, however, one could have shown nevertheless the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the decision of the championship (!).
Apparently it looks like that the F1 enjoys priority for legal reasons and everything else must be cut back so that Sky DE didn’t have a choice.
Still stupid because Sky UK finished the transmission of the race to the end.
Nevertheless a small praise: the commentator Oliver Zwartyes reported the difficult situation about that serious accident pretty well.
In the F1 the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher demonstrated once more their lack of knowledge about the rules since neither of them knew that you may change tires under the red flag.
Despite that this situation had already occurred in this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone both commentators first concluded that Verstappen may change the tires when respective radio messages to this subject were transmitted to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen did have this opportunity.
I believe one should know about those elementary rules when you comment the F1 for a Pay-TV-station.
And this is not the first guesswork what is possible or stipulated according to the rules, both display constantly simple insecurities regarding rules.
Generally I dislike Roos’ artificial commentator style but I admit that is a matter of taste.
Seriously, I even prefer Heiko Wasser with RTL.
In addition they utter constantly some sorts of silliness that makes them come across as unprofessional such as the ordering coffee from (also unexpecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or “UuuuuHD” from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last one creates plenty unrest in the commentary who obviously does not take the job seriously.
Last but not least commercials get out of hand at Sky, in the cool-down-lap Sky is the only station which turn to commercials as you can hear at F1TV since only the German sound track must deal without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations show much fewer commercials during training than Sky and that as Free-TV-station.
You must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, however, that alone doesn’t let me forget the disadvantages.
The other program by Sky Sport F1 is also rather poor and full of reruns.
Altogether Sky is really the worst German speaking station that transmits the F1.
Unsarcastically RTL does a better job - except for the commercials - with the four races they are still allowed to show.
In this way the magnificent F1 season provides much less fun as it would be possible with a reasonable station.
Please let me know your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hi, I have an article that was due to be delivered last week but still hasn’t been delivered.
I contacted Chat twice but so far haven’t heard from you.
The first lady promised to send out the article on Monday and a second lady told me yesterday that they will check and send an email but she has never responded.
Hi, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of the items showed a defect already after a relatively short time (material had a hole at the anterior part of the chair).
I request support.
Fan pumps are especially suitable to supply an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to run a filter system via a mammoth pump.
We offer this series in 3 versions.
Please view the chart at the end of the offer.
There you can compare performances.
If the pumps are strong enough you can run entire units with them.
If you have a big aquarium pumps with 2 or more exits are suitable so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has two or four exits, depending on the fan pump model they are also suitable to set accents in the aquarium, e. g. with an air curtain (you’ll find that here in the shop) or with a decoration that changes air bubbles into a function.
For example, a treasure chest, a shell or something similar.
The MK series features a special soundproof construction and thus produces low operating noises.
The installation is easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet or similar via an air hose 4/6 mm...and that’s it.
The fan pump should be mounted on the outside, even or higher than the water level.
If the fan pump is mounted lower than the water level one should place a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and fir the valve in between.
That would prevent water from flowing out of the aquarium through the pump should the water reverse its flow.
If the fan pump is mounted in open air it should be covered and protected from moisture like any other air pump
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even tough we indicate our processing time on e-bay with 3 days, we package daily and the packages are also being picked up daily.
If the transport is flawless, delivery is fast.
We only wanted to be careful so that nobody is upset only because it took a bit longer once.
It would be like that, not everybody has an understanding for all the coworkers who also work for delivery...of course, Corona doesn’t stop here.
Please, don’t immediately rate us poorly only because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively a thing of the parcel services.
One likes to complain about those services but we must also say,...it is rather difficult for them
Regionally it is often quite different.
Don’t be mad at anybody, stay healthy and we all hope that better times will return soon.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with or without the armrest?
Can I also order the legs here in light color?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four additional passengers undertook a short trip into space.
On Saturday they were transported with the rocket system “New Shepard” of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin.
Start and landing of the about ten minute flight happened in the west of the federal state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky Bezos personally welcomed back the freshly crowned astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back”, said Bezos, wearing a blue spacesuit, when he opened the hatch of the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and coworkers of the Blue Origin the six passengers climbed one after the other out of the capsule and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to information from Blue Origin they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74 years old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as Nasa astronaut in 1961 - Blue Origin’s rocket system was named after him - and the 50 years old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not tell us how much they paid for their tickets respectively.
After the short flight Laura Shepard Churchley reminded of her father’s mission.
With all his missions he had to work hard and had to do everything himself.
She was only a simple passenger, said the 74 years old with a smile.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He’d preferably return back into space again immediately, said the moderator.
“New Shephard” flies up to a height of 100 kilometers
The rocket system “New Shephard” flies largely on automatic.
The capsule is separated from the rocket during the flight and reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with zero gravity, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see the 100 kilometers above the earth as border to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space trip by Blue Origin: With the first trip in July Amazon founder Bezos was personally on board together with his brother Mark, a 82 years old retired female US-pilot and a 18 years old Dutchman.
The second trip in October was accompanied by the 90 years old Canadian actor William Shatner who became world-famous with his part as “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek”, then also the previous Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the acting boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin to push business with the space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and regardless of the climate.
In an uncomplicated way you may select via pressing a button whether your “Smart Stone” should light up permanently in one color or display its entire color repertoire.
When set to changing colors the light stone maintains a color for about one minute until it smoothly changes to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the “Smart Stone”-light works all year long outdoors.
Its light is especially splendid in a snow-covered environment - only a shortened illumination period might occur as soon as the days become shorter.
Please note in wintertime that snow doesn’t impair the solar module in its function.
“Smart Stone” uses a NiMh battery with known Mignon (“AA”)-format that can easily be exchanged.
You can purchase a suitable replacement battery via our workshop and thus prolong the decorative light’s lifespan.

Somebody who works in the biochemistry industry or who has studied biochemistry
At the moment I am enrolled in the first semester Biochemistry and I find the subject rather exciting and to participate in the lab doesn’t bother me (I have already completed my inorganic Chemistry internship).
Of course I have gathered information about career prospects already before my studies but thought at that point in time that I like to and certainly will continue my studies until my PhD.
But currently I have my doubts, in particular about my career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc.) I hear again and again about excellent career opportunities and that this profession is totally sought after, then again I hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid openings.
In view of that I would be really interested in:
1) In what capacity do you currently work?
2) Are you happy about your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ which training did you receive?
4) Would you do all that over again?
Many thanks for your replies!
At the moment I am absolutely uncertain and consider to give up my studies in 2022 and to pick up an education as IT specialist.
In case you have experience with that please let me know :)
Extra stress before vacation & holiday weekends
This was also subject for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
Therefore only a post now to that.
Not only before the big vacations such as the Christmas vacations do we experience extensive stress in the company.
It seems stress occurs also before holidays plus bridging days.
That is what happened: Last week was Assumption Day which is also called “Ascension” in Switzerland.
Most of the people and companies make the Friday a bridging day that is therefore semi-official.
So last week we anticipated therefore a long 4-day-weekend.
So what was happening last week?
Stress everywhere.
Many emails that had to be dispatched before Ascension, here an order, there an order, everything “absolutely” before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because does “next week then” sound like so much time and that must not be?
Or, in all seriousness, because do people want to accomplish so much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
I was then not only stressed on Wednesday but also greatly annoyed.
What is it about this self-flagellation due to holidays?
What for do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to really enjoying them?!
Mind you, stress does not come from the above, the colleagues developed that all by themselves.
My question is quite simple here: As Swiss, are we the only ones?
Is that our Reformed-Protestant kind?
Or do you know this also up North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to spend Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - however, she still hasn’t bought any presents.
“The good thing is, even if it should have no snow in Erfurt, you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest”, said the actress and singer to the Hit Radio FFH.
She would tune in to the festivities by baking cookies for her son and do some handicraft work.
“I’m loving that”, said Catterfeld.
But she would still have some work to do up to the reflective days: “It is the first time that I still have no presents, I must finally get going”.
NEKTON-Bio supports smooth process of the molt and plumage growth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of occurring plumage damages with bird keeping trace exclusively back to dietary errors.
Since the plumage consists of a protein-containing substance an especially rich and balanced protein diet is prerequisite for the bird in order to form a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A majority of animal losses during the molt is based on insufficient or unbalanced protein supply and/or insufficient supply with vitamins and minerals.
The ingredients of NEKTON-Bio explicitly consider and balance the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based animal feed.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio no additional vitamin products should be given.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be given via the drinking water or via soft food.
Many thanks, I found it
Unfortunately it still does not work
GDR - handmade model Altbau E-locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive originates probably out of the remodeling suggestion of the model train enthusiast ME magazine 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts, see photos, goof function; the series E 95 is a heavy freight train electro-locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) that was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, it is possible the series dates back to the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is presently in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we refurbish it to be operational
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (German Reichsbahn Company) ordered from AEG in 1924 to present proposals for an electro-locomotive that should be able to transport 2200 tons coal trains and 530 tons passenger trains with a 45 km/h travel speed on this rail route.
They requested a maximum speed 65 km/h.
Thus the DRG decided in March 1926 about the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with set bearing drive that AEG should deliver the mechanical parts, the Siemens-Schnuckerwerke the electric parts.
From December 1927 until June 1928 six locomotives were delivered and were assigned the company numbers E 95 01-06.
They all survived the Second World War and were later found on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives were brought into the Soviet Union as reparations.
In November 1952 they were brought back to Germany.
The Reichsbahn Repair Center Dessau determined that all six locomotives were worthy to be refurbished.
[4] When the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network demanded an increasing need of locomotives for the heavy freight train service the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, whereby the other machines served as spare part providers.
With that, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 that existed in larger numbers, were refurbished first.
Only when it was obvious with the E 94 that the refurbishing amount could no longer be increased the E 95 became focus of refurbishing.
[4] Initially the locomotives were placed in the Bahnbetriebswerk (depot) Leipzig-Wahren.
In 1960 they were transferred to the depot in Halle P.
They were used in an own rotating plan mostly for coal trains from Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age the complicated controls of the locomotives posed some problems.
It happened more frequently that contactors remained stuck when switching gears.
The traction unit attendant who was a permanent feature on this locomotive needed to loosen the contactor with hammer and wooden wedge while the train was moving.
Damages on the motors occurred more frequently and caused monthlong downtimes of the locomotives.
[5] Since sufficient numbers of newly built locomotives existed by the end of the 1960ies and since a significant expansion of the electric operations were not planned then, the Rechsbahn could waive the old locomotives and most of the splinter types so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to staff electro-locomotives now only with one person, what would have caused problems in train operations based on the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver’s cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 as well as the E 95 03 had been decommissioned mid 1969, they were followed by the last one, the E 95 01, that was retired on October 5, 1970.
The intended new name 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02 all locomotives were disassembled.
The E 95 02 was placed into the main train station Halle as point heating system substituting the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It still took some time until the responsible persons at the Rechsbahn could be convinced of the fact that the E 95 was worth of preservation as museum locomotive.
In 1979 the initially exterior refurbishing of the locomotive began with the goal to be able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then the locomotive belonged to the Transport museum) Dresden as non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the interior refurbishing of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum Halle (Saale) takes care of the locomotive museum-like.
Since 1995 coworkers of the Traditionsgemeinschaft (tradition community) Bw Halle P work on the refurbishing of the locomotive to make it operational again.
In April 2015 the locomotive could be presented for the first time with a new interior and exterior finish at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt, where the transformers had been checked and five traction motors are operational.
-Until 1945 the locomotives were used at the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side-routes where they stood their test due to their reliable drives and their low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
Main operational area was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, good function, necessary are visual reworks on the locomotive by the user, dusted, with play marks, cellar odor !!!, very rare handmade model, very rare edition, the kit might come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging might show labels and storage marks.
Yes, they are the F-parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is supported by two feet.. unfortunately, these are too small and the beam cannot be mounted onto the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot assemble the bed.
The central beam is supported by two feet, unfortunately those are manufactured wrongly.
The central beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So you’ll send me a new one.
When will you send them?
no, not flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions they are the right ones from the form but they were too small
But that is not important.
Main thing is they serve their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could you send me those?
Hi, #NAME#, should I explain the problem once more?
House fire with two slightly injured and massive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, estimated damage in a six-digit Euro range occurred, reported the police on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (district Landsberg am Lech).
According to given information, two inhabitants were hospitalized with light smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause for the fire was not know at first, however, the police did not suspect intentional arson.
The CID Fürstenfeldbruck assumed the further investigations.
But that will arrive later
And I must pay for shipping costs again
To invalidate fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in the beginning of 2021 on the social network “LinkedIn”
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin has so far not commented his vaccination status publicly.
The businessman published now a photo hat shows his Corona vaccination.
A friend of his fell ill and that caused him to get vaccinated, informed Şahin.
The CEO and cofounder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo that shows as he is getting vaccinated against the Corona virus.
“The social media reported false information that I allegedly would be vaccinated.
In fact my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine”, wrote Uğur Şahin on Friday in a message in the network “LinkedIn”.
“Friends have urged me for months now to post a photo of me that shows how I get vaccinated to counter these false rumors”.
Up to now he had declined that because the communication shouldn’t be about him personally.
But a call in the past week had changed his attitude: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that one of my old school mates is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and is on a respirator since three weeks.
The school mate and his family have not been vaccinated, continued Şahin to write.
He did not ask for the reasons.
“The most common cause might be the angst that is frequently fueled through misinformation and mistrust”.
Angst is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better therefore to share personal experiences.
In the Internet circulates an interview with the Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he were not vaccinated.
However, the video originated in December 2020 as the Deutsche Welle made clear itself.
“I am currently legally not allowed to receive the vaccine myself”, said Şahin then.
Germany prioritizes the vaccination with the vaccine.
Meanwhile that prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss had been vaccinated three times according to his own words.
Fire in transformer substation: Tens of thousands without power
On Friday evening the lights turned off in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no more power and thus probably no more heating in many cases.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer substation.
Tens of thousands people in the Rhine-Sieg-district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without power for about 24 hours after a fire with serious damages in a transformer substation.
Fire on Friday evening turned off the lights for 41000 inhabitants in several communities.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators had been operated on Saturday until the widespread malfunction could finally be completely repaired late that evening.
Fire fighters and helpers of the THW rendered assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called on neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the affected group of people for their patience and the helpers for their support.
We are very much aware of the fact that the last 24 hours brought about significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire fighters and the THW for their tireless support”, said the manager of the segment Primärtechnik, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damages would still take several days since the Westnetz technicians could initially operate again some lines only provisionally he explained.
According to information from the company a technical defect caused the fire.
Power is on again
According to information by Westnetz the fire that broke out at about 19:15 very much damaged parts of the 10000 Volt unit in the transformer substation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
Costly cleanup and repair work would be necessary there.
Parallel to that a link to a 30000 Volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass the power supply has been re-established.
Over 21000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power re-connected on Saturday at 18:00.
Another 20000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were step by step re-connected from 21:30 on.
At 23:15 the last people affected by the malfunction had power again.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
After establishing emergency power supply for important buildings the authorities had also called on neighborhood assistance on Saturday midday.
“It is important now that the citizens care for older or alone living people in their neighborhood and that they inform the local fire fighter stations when help is needed”, stated county commissioner Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When emergency generators are installed and operated the care for residents of old folks homes ranked first.
According to information by the authorities shelters in school were also established for those people who could not care for themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or rather depend on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I purchase it from you and pay with EURO?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you’ll have a nice too and stay healthy ♡
But I can’t mount the frame on the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
but we received 155 cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t telescope and thus shorten it.
Could you help me with that?
Otherwise, I must return it since it won’t be suitable for the purpose.
I am looking forward to your reply
yes, that is really simpler!
Then let’s do it so!
do you send me a return label via email?
the repair is now done.
I tried that already before the chat.
Before purchasing, however, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I almost find such a low voucher almost an insult.
We do not agree to that
Nordic combined: Nordic combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiner Fabian Reißle and Julian Schmid sprinted into the ranks at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
Once again the duo was defeated by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber who started into the trail already with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be remitted to my account?
Yes, we already have both renewed and use the version 4.5...
could be that you’ve heard of problems more frequently
With my #PRS_ORG# I bought directly a book, it seems it is listed there.
As soon I want to open it, a message appears, oops!
This document cannot be opened.
The file is possible defective, report it ton customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# file.
Can you help me with that?
The Chat connection is gone, and now what?
I also need to work occasionally!
For the paint application to be even and clean you should cleanse the components from dust, grease and fingerprints with some soap water, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you use the brush with new paint on the model for the first time, we recommend that you practice 2 to 3 brushstrokes first.
You can do that on interior components that are later no longer visible, or on a cup of yogurt.
The first stroke on a component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
A slight overlapping of the paint layers will provide an even surface later on.
Avoid fast back and forth wiping with the brush.
That creates areas that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could show through later on.
Use metallic shades and metallic colors with a separate brush only at the very end.
Otherwise, you might experience ugly metallic streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a whole day before you integrate them.
The models appear true to the original through decals or rather transfer pictures.
From national emblems on planes, ship names to trims and signs on cars: Decals give the finishing touches to the models.
Apply decals in the right sequence as long as the components can be reached easily.
It is easier to glue on decals to a plane’s cockpit before it is integrated in the hull.
Even more important than the correct tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when you apply decals.
Cut out every needed decal individually and put them in the right order.
Decals are also named waterslide-decals because you moisten their backside with water for a short time until the release paper darkens through the applied moisture.
Then you slide the picture only a small distance from the paper and you apply the item onto the respective location on the model (which had also moistened prior to that).
While you adhere the decal to the model with a tool you laterally pull away the release paper.
Attention: Always check first whether the picture fits correctly before you slide the decal completely from the paper so that it does not adhere to your finger, crumbles or even tears.
Blot surplus water with some household wipes.
Note: not suitable for kids under 3 years
I can open a book only for a short time, as soon as I look for something else I cannot read the book any longer; I must log out, log in again, re-load the book and find the place where I stopped reading.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this via email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp was sent to me in 3 single packages
OK, nevertheless many thanks!
then I will buy it somewhere else as soon as the money is returned.
But do I get the money back without a problem?
Fertility treatment at PKV / What is an “insurance claim”?
Hi you all,
we participated in a fertility treatment for some time, now in regard to the account settlement with the PKV the insurance suddenly objects.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment at the PKV beforehand and got confirmation for 3 attempts.
These attempts were in no ways (e.g. timeframe, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt resulted directly in a successful pregnancy and birth and the account was balanced with the PKV.
Some time later we attempted to have a second child and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts but didn’t settle the account with the PKV as of yet.
We again applied for the cost coverage at the PKV and they granted again 3 additional attempts.
After several additional attempts (we attempted more often than granted, invoiced logically the most expensive to PKV), presented the bills to PKV and received some bad news: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) PKV wants to reimburse us only for 3 attempts.
The reasoning: The pregnancy/birth forfeited the remaining 2 attempts from the first confirmation.
The second desire to have children became a new insurance claim.
However, according to AGB “The insurance case starts with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.”
The questions for the experts here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts were granted) or we (5 attempts should be have been granted)?
* Was the PKV obliged to indicate to us in its confirmation that further attempts were voided after a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked ovaries) has not been healed through giving birth of the first child.
It would be great to learn about experts’ opinions.
Many thank in advance for your help!
Can you send me the three versions via email and tell me how I could best reach you again
Okay.
We will no longer place orders with you.
When you add up sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address) you will have obviously lost good customers.
You might just as well forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday your colleague told me that reimbursement had been initiated and now you are telling me that I first have to return the item.
It is certainly not my fault that the sideboard arrived at my place completely destroyed
Please view the screenshot what the colleague had written me
It says clearly and unmistakably that the reimbursement had been initiated and I still have not received the reimbursement from #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have lost two regular customers now.
My friend also ordered diverse furniture for our apartment via his account.
We now won’t do this any longer.
No, the defect was only visible after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, you must not sell it as office chair.
Regardless of that, a warranty time of 24 months applies.
No, it is impossible for me provide a different kind of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available for the carrier in that condition.
Hi, I have a question to your series #PRS_ORG#
You advertise these products with stools that must be purchased in addition but unfortunately we can’t find those in your catalog.
Can you help us?
Subject of the week: The best low budget movies
There is no general definition about what exactly represents a low budget movie with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia states the following to this subject:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
The net lists plenty of low budget movies such as under Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What do you find appealing?
And what do you actually not like at all?
I am a very good customer at your company, I already furbished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I would like to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time was extended once more, is that now a binding time?
Many thanks
With friendly regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where one needs to wait for 30 min is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes about the waiting position...I will give again on that because it just doesn’t work here.
Hello
“Half a victory” against Belarus at high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong the EU can announce a “half victory” in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs would be very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, told Bossong the Evangelische Pressedienst (Protestant News Service) (epd).
The EU had never solved the confrontation sustainably explained the researcher to the Berlin Stiftung Wisssenschaft und Politik (SWP) (Science and Politics Foundation.
This limbo - Belarus does not quite back down but the EU feels like a winner - will still continue for a while.
Bossong judges that the handling of the human beings at the border would not be consistent with the European human rights convention.
Obviously there would be an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” through individual EU governments.
Since the EU in its entirety does not oppose it decisively the situation goes at the expenses of the basic rights.
That development would also weaken the solidarity of the Union.
“The Union can obviously not prevail when a member state insists on following its own agenda”, like currently Poland that doesn’t even grant access to the borders to the EU border management agency Frontex.
Furthermore, the EU would pay another price for its policy at the borders with Belarus, so Bossong: An agreement in principle about the asylum policy would be complicated since the line “border management” had been strengthened.
Anew attempt of border crossing
According information from Polish border guards migrants attempted again in the meantime to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night before Sunday and were brought back to the border, said a speaker for the authorities on Sunday.
Polish officials had reportedly been pelted with stones thrown by migrants in the incident not far from the village Czeremsza.
According to reports one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated medically by a military doctor.
The border guards registered altogether 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had climbed the border barriers already on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko as ruler in Minsk to have lured them with the hope to be able to travel into the EU.
According to press reports Poland and Lithuania cordoned off entire border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened air carriers to bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU officials travelled to countries of origin of the people to stop their departures there.
The most effective element of the EU reaction would be to pressure air carriers, said Bossong.
“The EU has weighed here its market dominance and proven its determination to act with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions”.
Minsk would also have to consider domestic consequences.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for a situation where their security apparatus smuggles thousands of people through the land on a regular basis.
Mercedes launches protest after the controversial Formula 1 finals
In Mercedes’ view Max Verstappen broke the rules twice during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finals in Abu Dhabi Mercedes filed a protest.
The Mercedes Silberpfeile suspect even two rule breakings during the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase when he allegedly passed another car against the rules.
A second protest was launched against the assessment at the end of the race.
The protocol was not observed consistent with the rules in the view of Mercedes.
Verstappen had passed Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes still in the last round and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver happened at the end of a safety car phase during which the Dutchman passed cars that were in front of him.
I check that.
I talk to my bank and will call you back
thank you for your support
Free-of-charge admission for members: The Euro-Park organizes a SC Freiburg fan-day
The Europa-Park, eponym for the Euro-Park stadium of the sports club Freiburg, invited to a SC Freiburg fan-day.
As the park announced members and season ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed free-of-charge admission to the Euro-Park on this day.
In addition vouchers for drinks and sausages were also offered.
The roller coasters shined in red and white uniforms on that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons displayed a perfect background, reported the park.
The cooperation exists between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park, located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, already since the beginning of the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg fan-day in the Euro-Park showed once more how fitting this partnership is.
“To see those happy fans who enjoy the fun in the roller coaster rides confirm that”, said Euro-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is the €#NUMBER# and not as the original €1699?
Stages in the carrier of the new world champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new world champion of the Formula 1.
Max Verstappen has achieved it.
The Dutchman in his Red Bull won his first WC-title in his seventh year in the Formula 1.
His way to the summit of the royal class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen gambled away the cart world championship after his crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him in anger at a gas station when they travelled home.
His mother Sophie Kumpen collected the teenager in the following car.
2014, England: Red Bull’s junior team welcomes Verstappen as promising new recruit.
The 16 year old one thus follows the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
For the time being he continues to drive in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: At age 17 and 166 days Verstappen starts in a Grand Prix as youngest pilot in history.
Due to a defect he had to prematurely park his Toro Rosso in Melbourne.

Judith Hermann read from her novel “Daheim” (at home)
The author Judith Hermann read from her current novel “Daheim” within the book reading tour “LiteraTour Nord” on Friday in the sold out Blue Note where she also appeared as moderator.
Judith is divorced, lives in a house at the coast and listens carefully to the nightly sounds at her doorstep.
Yesterday I posted the contact form for returning an article but I haven’t received an email confirmation or something similar to it.
My question is whether my inquiry has been received.
Not everybody has the time for your stupid chat and the wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you solve and not everything from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with you every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or rather Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 EURO voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
So far, the email was not sent.
Still today I would like to bring the package to #PRS_ORG#.
Please contact me
With kind regards

Sorry, but only because he insists that he is no anti-Semite it doesn’t mean anything.
That is like somebody from the AfD says he is not opposed to foreigners.
Neither of them will admit his/her true color.
But Kollegah produces continuously some anti-Semite messages.
When you want to distance yourself from it just leave it completely alone.
Then you will be taken less seriously similar to Kollegah.
Who seriously questions the act of evolution is simply completely out of it.
For all I care God has initiated the whole thing.
But as soon as you are creationist you must believe that earth is 10000 years old and that science talks only nonsense.
And thus you are a science denier and you are no longer taken seriously just as Kollegah
To get an optimal visual field the magnifying glass should come as close to the eye as possible.
The especially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free from distortion and color error-free up to the peripheral zone.
The magnifying glasses are often identified with magnification details.
This information is, however, only valid for exactly pre-defined conditions that rarely correspond with the conditions for use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally we ask you to take note of the references in the chart “Technical data” (see user manual in the packaging).
Light reflexes originate on all lens surfaces of all optical devices - also on folding magnifiers.
An anti-reflex coating significantly reduces these reflections.
Observing the optimal conditions for use - magnifier close to the eye - reduces the perception of reflections on the lens surfaces.
Further information you’ll find in the enclosed user manual (provided in German and English language).

Pine tree sales in Schönwolde: Women select the Christmas trees in the community of Krembz
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced quite some strange situations when selling pine trees.
One day a man supposedly drove home without his partner because the two couldn’t reach an agreement.
Every year he’s planting about 2000 trees for that.
With that the 56 year old man experienced some strange situations.
But that makes the pre-Christmas season always somewhat entertaining, he says.
And what is with the voucher??
Otherwise I’m gone as a customer?!
After all I have received a defective delivery and paid for it the full amount.
Then I will take this also into account accordingly!
We don’t need to discuss who prepared the better meal but a certain similarity between the two is obvious.
Both dishes consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their name from it.
In German an equivalent would perhaps be the “skewer” but that doesn’t sound so inviting.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
Since a couple of weeks we have a new glass fiber connection in the house.
Unfortunately I have problems now to establish a stable Wifi network.
Prior to that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan which received and sent 50 Mbit without problems except for a few malfunctions.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and on the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox and they arrive there.
However, the full 500 do not arrive on the other DLan module that sends the Wifi and the farther I go with the module in the house the less signals will be received (I also use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3 rooms etc. distance from the other module).
The result is that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is even slower on the first floor than previously (\-45 Mbit).
I ordered a new Devolo Magic Set since new technology is apparently being used.
This set is somewhat better than the DLan but revealed similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is being “lost” with glass fiber via the power line?
And is LAN really the lone solution?
It would be extremely costly to have LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate this is why I established an account here.
Therefore I would be very happy about some answers.
When the time comes to change the checking account
Who thought everything is quiet about checking accounts is gravely mistaken.
While many banks used the fall to have - with all kind of tricks - past increases in fees once more confirmed by their customers the allowances for negative interest rates continue to drop.
The deutsche Bank e. g. was considered to be relatively generous with a limit of 100000 Euro.
Now it just about cut the allowance in half and even quartered the daily allowances.
In a first step the limit was lowered only for customers of the group segment Postbank - to 50000 Euro for checking and investment accounts and to 25000 for daily allowance accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lowered allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts but also for “newly reached individual agreements with regular customers”.
The Commerzbank had already earlier dropped the limit to 50000 Euro which still applies, just as it is done at the ING Deutschland.
The Direktbank DKB popular in particular with cost-conscious customers lowered the allowances in two steps, first to 50000 Euro and now to 25000 Euro.
Still: More than 100 banks meanwhile have an allowance of 25000 Euro or less according to numbers issued by the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached the 25000 Euro mark: However, a legal dispute with the consumer advice centers is still ongoing there; in first instance they actually prevailed against this regulation before the district court Berlin.
Now the banks already discuss whether the institutes should possibly build up reserves - just in case that also higher instances declare the negative interest rates principally for inadmissible and that they have to pay back millions to their bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially top star of Hollywood.
However, her life is rather tumultuous.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was selected most influential woman of the year by the US magazine “The Hollywood Reporter”.
For Jennifer, who made a big splash in 2021 with the “Friends” reunion and the continuance of her series “The Morning Show”, this success is first of all the result of much discipline and hard work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches take care of her appearance.
According to Aniston she indulges after all in eating one chip per day (yes, you read this right: one SINGLE chip out of a bag).
That female and male fans adore her likewise is, however, actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with her happiness - and is still searching for true love.
And she gave up on the desire to have a baby.
Prior to that she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who asked her that have no idea what I am going through personally, medically, why I can’t do that.
It was really hurtful.
Let us hope that success and stardom create also happiness.
Unworthy finish of a carrier: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s departure from the Formula 1 was even more quiet than intended.
Abu Dhabi - The 42 years old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a light collision with a guardrail Räikkönnen had to park his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race at the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the “Iceman” finished his carrier in the royal class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and his two children had travelled to the United Arabic Emirates to bid him farewell.
Räikkönen’s greatest success was winning the world championship in the Ferrari in 2007.
He had 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and stepped onto the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60. World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-women bob - sports
The benchmark of the Norwegian Nordic biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bob-pilot.
“I have calculated that once, I would have to win nine and a half times per season then I could achieve it until Cortina in 2026”, said double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg who posted even two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First he fended off Johannes Lochner’s attack by five one-hundredth while driving from rank three to rank one.
Then he changed something at the material settings and pulled away with an even larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed against the Brit Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier scored third.
“We took a greater risk today and were rewarded”, said Friedrich, who achieved his 22. win in series.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, starting for Stuttgart, reached this time rank five after rank two the day before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach ranked eighth after he had landed in place four in the first race.
“If I would know what he does differently I would also do the same”, opined Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte got her third seasonal victory in the two-women bob at her home track.
After she ranked only fourth with the mono-bob the day before she raced to World Cup victory with pusher Deborah Levi at a German triple win on Sunday.
Two-women bob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia reached rank two with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
Beside her Olympia qualification she achieved her first ranking in this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden with Leonie Fiebig landed in place three.
For me it was super cool, first ranking in a World Cup race, I am super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I am very happy about this development.
There is still great potential at the start, but the start times were okay today”, said Burghardt and stressed: “It is not only pushing, there is also still much to do all around”.
Jamanka was a bit upset about the not quite flawless runs, but opined: “We’re going in the right direction”.
I have the blanket already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn’t receive the voucher and therefore I couldn’t utilize it, therefore I finally inquired about it.
Due to Corona I had quite different problems last year and didn’t have the time for it.
And now you tell me it has expired, and that makes me very angry.
Please look into the Chat, the subject was the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then re-order it since the price has now been reduced :)
Why does delivery not start until 3/16?
Your website did not indicate such a long delivery time
No, only when I click on it an extra field with a message arrives
Was accepted by your colleague yesterday.
Why is it a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered merchandise.
But we nevertheless would like the shelve module but rather a new, undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only still this day, only still this week, only still to XY...
Hi dear beautiful girls and women,
I have something here I would like to write about and perhaps the one or the other experiences the same thing...
I am 24, have kPTBS, am fulltime student and dog mom - irregardless that my dog doesn’t scream or visits the kindergarten he ist practically my 1 to 1 child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is ill suffered from a burn of 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is in therapy now).
Yesterday I visited him because I also do have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him having a shower (his hand is all bandaged up because of the burn).
On top of that he has a cold and we see one another currently less frequently (1-2x week) what is very hard for me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog-child has an upset stomach, I cooked for him and now he lies in his blanket and relaxes a bit once I brought him a heat lamp and petted him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother and she is currently gone for one month.
Now we still have to manage the household and we share the work of course.
But even cooking has become much work for me now...
My PTBS illness has been adjusted quite well, I am treated well to some extend and manage.
Not too well, but I manage and am almost symptom-free.
My university requires my full attention, tomorrow at 15h we have a written test for which I have not yet studied and the day after tomorrow we have anatomy hour for which I should prepare myself at least a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what is happening then is written in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room for it.
My week goes as follows: Only to the day after tomorrow then it is weekend.
But then the whole thing continues?
Only until my birthday.
Only to the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until to...
And there it goes on in all eternity.
I believe I am currently so stressed that I need these mental reference points, otherwise I couldn’t take it.
Somehow I feel guilty and “chaotic” but I couldn’t handle it otherwise...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am greatly grateful that don’t have to work.
Really eternally grateful, I can’t even find words for it.
I don’t know whether I would otherwise have survived my kPTBS.
I think that also has partially to do with the mental load of women and therefore I thought that I might find fellow sufferers here for sure...
At any rate I still wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Today I have received my order but unfortunately its color is totally different, its surface is scratched and the table leg shows an imprint.
With the first delivery the color was just like the one shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now do I get another color, or what else?
The email regarding the cancellation was sent to you on 12/26 under #NUMBER#.
By the way: twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I had noticed in school then that many teachers of religion did not believe in God and that this subject was just an additional one such as math or geography.
I found this quite strange perhaps because I was brought up in Christian faith and thus was always somehow a believer.
What is your opinion?
Perhaps you can talk about colleagues at work or from your studies who have different views.
Principally I understand the difference between private life and profession and it makes sense, to keep them separate.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn’t believe in the relativity theory.
What then causes a person to want to teach religion when you don’t believe in it?
Preserve culture or similar?
I hope this question isn’t too personal.
Can it be changed, yes or no? I like to write in English, I understand it well
That is quite long, then I would back off
Alright, thank you.
I expect your reply promptly no later than at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search please help
Hi, dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
The film featured two timelines (or parallel worlds).
There was the modern world (real world).
And there was the past world (or the realm of the dead)(not sure about that).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world there was a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead was a young soldier (his uniform was similar to those of the soldiers in Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason their ways cross and a plot originates.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into his realm to be able to live.
I believe the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
I believe at the end both soldiers fight against one another.
If you can recognize it I am grateful for any hint.
Our baby has slept on her belly from week 1 on.
Fast forward: is still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can tolerate much more than you think.
Pay attention to everything around it is okay, no plush toys, go in there more frequently and look after it, but no constant monitoring.
That would drive you to insanity!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And by the way, our child had no sleeping bag but used a blanket from the beginning.
Watch you child once when it is asleep.
Does it turn its head sideways?
Can it support itself somewhat from its belly?
Or does it lie with its face directly on the mattress?
From there you can learn whether everything is okay.
We all grew up to become adults and when my husband was born is was quite common that kids were laid to sleep on their belly.
Besides that, we are already “regular customers” and we have purchased already very many articles from you
But why do you offer me then only 20 EURO?
Hi, yesterday I wrote to a colleague of yours but so far I have not received any answer.
Subject is my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe can currently not be used as is.
To say it loud and clearly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And well, I personally know not all promises can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is however clear that this station’s policies are meanwhile totally unacceptable.
Almost every format is being sponsored (ok) but then at the same time they go begging for things.
It was said they were an “independent” Internet station.
Quote Arno: We didn’t want to be a “running advertising pillar”.
So what are we now?
An average advertising station that tries to sell its BilloMerch to its elite fans.
And then we still have Marah’s Do’s & Do nots.
They apply to everybody except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can continue to offend the people.
A Krogmann who totally lacks empathy who tries to turn into ashes the exploded leased rooms at the account of the action.
How can you tolerate all that?
Great, if you like it, I despise it.
Please call me back since the delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#
Whether it consoles me when I have a stomachache or simply when cuddling - my little warming companion finds use in many ways.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional household remedy for soothing heat applications because cherry stones absorb heat very well and are able to emit warmth again in doses.
The removable interior pillow can be warmed up very easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application a pleasant experience so that the little ones feel secure even when they don’t feel too well at times.
As heating pad the cherry stone pillow with cover is suited exclusively for the following areas of application:
Check for atypical odor and mold stains or burn marks before you warm up the pillow, and if they exist dispose of the pillow immediately.
Please remove the interior pillow from the cover before heating it!
In the microwave at maximum 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (please observe the instructions by the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after warming it distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
After that return the interior pillow into its cover.
With first warming the pillow’s surface might become slightly moist; that will disappear with repeated applications.
Please, observe the indicated warming instructions at all costs since longer warmup times or higher energy can lead to damages (ignition hazard and risk of burns!).
Before warming up the pillow in the microwave check the manufacturer’s user manual if the heating of grain products is allowed.
After returning the pillow into its cover, please check the pillow’s temperature on its arm bend whether it is suitable for babies (max. 430 C)!
Do not use the pillow when a person suffers acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, has circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as with persons with reduced pain perception.
Please consult a physician before the application when skin, heart, vein or tumor illnesses, or a pregnancy exist.
If the seams of the pillow got loose and individual stones come out, dispose of the product and the loose cherry pits immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If you use the product with babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during the application to exclude overheating!
All grave events incurred in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the respective authorities of the country in which the user lives.
The cover is removable and can be machine-washed at 300 C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt in second place after away series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of a return into the Fußball Bundesliga.
Meanwhile Hannover 96 works on leaving the bottom of the league.
Ingolstadt does not have a good run even with the third coach.
Celebrations in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, happiness in Hannover about interim-coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut with new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery kaput?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was not charged by my power supply.
I had purchased a new one about 5 months ago so it should still be working.
I thought the lone power supply is sufficient for operations.
My bad, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore despite plugged in power supply.
Then I took out the battery but nothing worked.
Perhaps you have ideas?
I ordered a new battery but why can’t I use the laptop with the power supply?
Is something else malfunctioning?
Many thanks for your replies!
I request the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# into the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don’t know how high is the seat...
On the road often and still carrying a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 liters capacity pose no problem for even larger camera equipment.
And what else you might need on everyday items - they remain well organized in the individually configurable interior thanks to practical accesses, and separate from the camera equipment.
In addition, “Updating” the Everyday Line to its version 2 (V2) brings a new look to the series.
The chic minimalistic design literally has it in itself - Peak Design developed some highly innovative solutions for the Everyday Backpack series that protect the interior of the rucksack reliably but nevertheless grant also immediate access to your camera equipment.
That works with two possibilities: Once quite conventionally via the cover flap that can be locked with the MagLatch closing system - an excellently thought-through solution for effective protection that has proven itself with the Messenger bags.
Here you’ll find a metallic locking hook with suitable anchor bar on the front side of the rucksack.
Different from most backpacks Peak Design considered here various “fill levels”: there are indeed 4 anchor hooks, strongly riveted, in which you can hook the locking hook.
When the backpack is fully loaded you just use the most upper bar, if it is rather empty, you use a lower one.
In addition, the cover flap lock and the hook are also magnetic.
This way the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping in the hook.
The second possibility differs the Everyday Backpack also fundamentally from other photo backpacks: Beside the cover flap there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the rucksack.
That eliminates the greatest disadvantage of common backpacks with access from the top - you don’t have to search through the contents any longer!
At the same time this clever detail increases its everyday usefulness enormously: If and when you carry along not only your camera equipment but also everyday items or travel utensils.
You can configure the interior of your Everyday Backpack individually (more about that below) and so you can pack both items separate from one another without problems - and reach them independently via the two lateral openings.
You may pull the rucksack in front of your body from the right side and e. g. access the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the everyday items remain securely in the left half of the backpack, and nothing interferes in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carry straps help with that.
The exterior cover of the rucksack is also completely made from 100 % recycled weather-proof nylon which keeps the contents dry even when you plan travelling to Scotland in fall.
Unfortunately, I’ve been waiting for your support’s email in vain.
#NAME# promised me yesterday an email to confirm
the order to establish contact with the carrier regarding the pick-up of the wrongly delivered table.
I did not receive any message until now.
I ask for the immediate processing.
I write already to the third support coworker but with none of them I succeeded further than a promise that I would receive an email to confirm.
Subject is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
Can you tell me when the cabinet could be re-delivered?
To keep it as is, is no option for me.
It works.
Many, many thanks for your help
I want to wish you a pleasant evening
hi, my order number is #NUMBER#, when will you be delivering the article?
Order and payment were placed on 1/12/21.
A completely different lamp from the one I had ordered was delivered to me
Please call me
If you extend the voucher then I will place a larger order immediately, after all I have kept the damaged furniture and didn’t return it.
And that the past year went differently than expected I could not foresee and I was unable to solve and clarify the issue in timely fashion.
But I suffer the consequences as customer and I don’t accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the Westcoast.
In winter of 1848 a man discovered shiny chunks at the southern junction of the American River.
Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret the news started to spread fast and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma to one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and salons and hotels popped up almost over night.
Everybody wanted his/her share of the country’s richness.
For many it meant: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks richness in the West and wants to make a name for him/herself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build up companies.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river runs and the adjacent regions.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same intentions!
You must outperform your pioneer colleagues so you don’t get bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategic game with many ways to victory.
You select your actions simultaneously, you must budget your resources and establish a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “Engine Building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to get additional actions or change rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridging tiles you can develop your individual playing style with the help of slight adaptations.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was detected in Coloma), across 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California received the official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round the players select secretly and simultaneously a site on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers onto the suitable sites.
When a site has the most pioneers he/she gets locked!
The lock deactivates one half of the site - that will reduce possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternatingly actions, such as the obtaining of resources, movement of wagons, pitching tents, search of rivers, building of bridges, opening businesses and the positioning of gunslingers.
When all actions are concluded the pioneers will return back.
The advertiser turns to a new site at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues as long as the advertiser had moved five times thus covering each site once, and the year ends.
There is a gunfight where the players must defend Coloma against a raid of furious bandits.
When the players had contributed enough gunslingers and successfully outnumbered the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail they receive lesser rewards or end up in a cemetery.
The game ends after the third gunfight, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

“Why children are not tyrants” Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation resurfaced today on my Twitter timeline and I watched it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and he gives lectures Europe-wide.
With his book “Why do our children become tyrants” (2008) he triggered a significant educational debate.
Former patients and legal guardians raise now severe accusations against him.
Please pay close attention the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that meanwhile many people thing and act differently.
For us as parents and other responsible beings it must never, never, never! be about power over a child.
Our goal must always be to grant a child enough room for its development and to make the frame for the child big enough as it makes sense for and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I am still shaking.
Holetschek: States consult about dropping the obligated tests for triple-vaccinated
In their next meeting the state secretaries of Health want to decide about dropping the test obligations for triple-vaccinated.
“We, the States need quick clarification whether and from when on the test obligations can be dropped for triple-vaccinated”, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Secretary of Health Conference to the “Bild am Sonntag”.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated would make “sense not only medically but also provide an additional incentive to get vaccinated”, said Holetschek.
Federal Secretary of Health, Karl Lauterbach (SPD) had said “that he would present a proposal to that to the Secretary of Health Conference already on the upcoming Tuesday”. - afp
I would like to return the lamp
What is the best way to do it?
Hi, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, however, I can’t see how high is the seat.
Can you help me with that?
I can no longer purchase anything via my #PRS_ORG#.
Message: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# site on the PC works.
I updated the account data.
What can cause that?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, namely sensory perception under general anesthesia.
Those occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most frequently the hearing of noises/voices will occur, more rarely the eying of images and very rarely the perception of pain.
Relevant for this subject: Cesar sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness since the use of a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until cutting the cord.
Preceded episodes of awareness should be mentioned when explaining the anesthesia.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as totally intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) pose a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, my comment describes awareness correctly, however, ** u/Nitemarex ** didn’t have any per definition.
Have misread your commentary.
But the chair is defect.
The 20 € won’t make it go away.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that you take back the defect chair.
Besides the legal obligation this is standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check once more if you would at least take the defect chair back.
Then we will sell the second chair privately.
This way we will lose also some money.
I already sent you an email but you didn’t respond.
The question again.
On the order and on the invoice it says that the merchandise will be delivered up to a room of my choice.
The carrier is the company #NAME#.
I just called them.
I was informed that they only deliver to the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order since I don’t know anybody who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
will I not be called on the phone?
I posed a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He had made a name for himself as theater critic and also as director.
Later in life he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book still lies on the table, hot off the press: “An old man grows older”.
The shocking diary of a slow good bye to the world lived by theater critic and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And while reading the news broke that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: “My ever thanks for my life”.
There are different kinds of pallets.
One of the most common ones are Euro-pallets, normed wooden pallets that find their use as load carriers in particular in European areas.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020 more than ten million pallets were produced according to the Statistics Austria in Austria.
Their production value was at around 79 million Euro.
It is not clear how many pallets are being imported to Austria annually

Roulades tips & tricks
One week ago I received many great tips for a perfect goulash.
We had it for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butter tender!
Many thanks again for the recipe :)
Now I found my taste and I want to cook roulades for the first time for New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I will prepare a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven but only a big pot.
Where do we go from here?
What is it with the books or rather how do I get them again on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore but I will handle it
Subject is the reimbursement of €#NUMBER#
on 01/18 I was already informed via email that the refund had been issued.
However, no money has been received by me up to today.
Would you please check that.
Where a Christmas roast is still available in the Lübeck area
For many people goose or duck belong to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree or presents.
You didn’t purchase your poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We tell you where you still can get a Christmas roast in the area of Lübeck.
The “driver” of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and richness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics will be perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller you can adjust the desired level on the one hand, and also the distortion level of your sound.
Furthermore, the amplifier of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that lets you reduce the sound volume without changing anything on the “Gain” and the distortion.
As we already mentioned above one can also activate a reserve capacity with the POWER LEVEL controller when the sound level is once all too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller you can utilize the entire potential of the VT+ series in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as line output.
This is to say that the signal applied here will be processed with a box simulation so that you’ll get an eminent “acoustic” sound impression even when using headphones or rather with direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player may be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also integrated - therefore you don’t need a separate tuner.
If you grant yourself a VFS5 foot switch in addition you may also call on the sounds comfortably via foot, switch the effect blocks off and on and “tap” the tempo of the compatible effects respectively.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
VOX takes another step into the future with its new power packages!
But I have seen that so at others.
Is there then the possibility to return the lamp?
Since it hangs too low above a dining table?
So I would like to return it.
Can you help me with that?
And the sideboard?
In the next few weeks do we receive another update of the exact delivery date?
Hi, have you ever sit down on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If that does not work I would be happy with a discount or voucher.
Perhaps I can find a buyer for the furniture.
By the way, beyond € 1.000 for merchandise that I don’t need are quite a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know whether screws were part of delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) with the provided hook.
That is no satisfactory answer and the holding time was not worth it
Do you have a premium customer status in your company?
Iran sees progress in negotiations about the Nuclear Agreement
According to Iranian information progress is made in the negotiations about reviving the international nuclear agreement.
“Both sides are close to agree on subjects which should be part of the agenda”, said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This constitutes a “positive and important development” because at the start one couldn’t even agree on common subjects that were to be negotiated.
The agreement ought to prevent the Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
On Thursday the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a week-long interruption.
Emissaries from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna but does not participate in the negotiations directly.
Thuringia surpasses Saxony - free sate now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia replaced Saxony and exhibits now the nationwide highest Corona incidence.
As the only federal state Thuringia sports a Corona incidence over 1000.
Thuringia is the only federal state where the Corona incidence reached a mark over 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven day value with 1025 new infections per 100000 citizens.
Saxony that had featured the nationwide highest incidence for the longest time this mark was at 990.5 on Sunday.
The incidence had sunk a bit in Thuringia on Friday and Saturday the mark was still at a value over 1000.
Within one day Thuringia reported 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 additional fatalities in connection with an infection.
200 severely Covid-19 affected people were cared for in intensive care units at hospitals on Sunday.
Weekends may cause a delay in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overburdened already for weeks and they can hardly catch up with registering new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will be done only at the beginning of March perhaps it is possible until then.
I must print it, paste it on the package and bring it to the post office, that’s all?
do I have nothing else to click on/specify/fill out?
Exactly that I’d like to avoid therefore I am writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own charge.
8 EURO return fee is unheard of in my view.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag, greetings to all of you, I am u/StratorDE on the floor in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is this post for?
When you look at the activity of the previous months of the MBundestags you can only determine: It doesn’t exist.
We have entered hibernation and expanded the summer hole to some months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause for it?
For the most part this is probably attributed to the dissatisfaction how things have been called upon and how they are generally being presented.
The last few days left increasingly the impression that many are still rather keen having the MBundestag.
#What we have to change
Here the community around the MBundestag is asked which they want to keep alive.
The impulse came from u/editVEVO who became aware of this project during the last few days and who had, simply said, found shambles.
After some exchanges in writing several people from the community were found who feel like resurrecting the project.
However, I would once more call on all explicitly to participate only in this way the project will have a chance to exist in the future.
We produced a platform for debating in form of a discord server on which we can share our thoughts and work also on concrete subjects.
You can reach that server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations must be changes / adapted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside in the future?
* How should we recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I am pretty sure that I’ve forgotten something but that is not so important for that we have the discord at the end.
If you feel like it join the discord, work with us and let us decide about the future in a democratic way.
I ordered a lampshade with it that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For that I already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope that this will be returned and I get fully reimbursed.
This is also quite sad since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, do you have it in plus size, so for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must yet be able to guarantee me that the defective cabinet will e picked up promptly.
And I’d like to ask you to take care of that now.
I don’t have suitable packaging but will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for pick-up - you must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that is going to work.
#PRS_ORG# can reach me on the phone at any time to set up a pick-up date.
Are there instructions for the assembly?
How much time do I have to get those or rather to decide on the return?
How do you answer the question why you are a vegetarian?
Today I had a talk with a colleague who I dearly like.
She herself had been living as a vegetarian for a while and eats currently meat on very rare occasions.
I myself was also vegetarian for several years.
I answered the question honestly and without hesitation whether I always wanted to be vegetarian and whether vegetarianism was a planned interim stage.
For a long time I thought I would support animal welfare as vegetarian but I reflected and understood eventually that I also supported animal cruelty with that.
Therefore my decision to become vegetarian.
In this moment I had the impression that my friend became rather displeased, she then defended vegetarianism and mentioned that she knew where her meat would come from and that one would reduce the suffering of animals as vegetarian.
Now I ask myself whether my answer was too “crude”?
How do you answer this question?
I have the feeling that as a vegetarian you are rather fast discriminated against and conflicts arise without provoking them.
Regards from a harmony-loving vegetarian (;
It clearly does not refer to an exception according to § 312 BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not absolve you from the requirements regarding distance sales.
I will not be present at the assigned date when the #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can’t be present due to a funeral unfortunately that can’t be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup date.
From 02/01 #NUMBER# on I can be reached again continuously.
Firefighters in Lahnstein equipped for water rescue: 45000 Euro grant from the state
Just recently in the Lahnstein city hall the Rhineland-palatinate secretary of the interior Roger Lewentz presented a grant notice in the amount of 45000 Euro to mayor Peter Labonte for the purchase of a new equipment cart ‘water rescue’ of the voluntary fire department.
The total costs of the vehicle that is being used since November 2020 amount to 135000 Euro.
A good and important investment for safety.
“I am glad that the state Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in that”, says the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte.
The equipment cart will be used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of altogether seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below the water those units are busy with water and ice rescues as well a technical assistance.
Lahnstein anticipates permanently increasing rescue services: The boom of hotel cruises on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the still increasing use of the river Lahn as recreational river contribute to that.
I bought a book but I could only read 10 % of it and then the problems started.
I can’t open the book.
However, I had followed your recommendations and synchronized, removed and re-loaded the app; NOTHING worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the entire action took already much time, and I hope now to receive help.
Okay, is that way.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date during the order process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard the above mentioned values have been found in the Fenix lab at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the integrated 275mAh LiPo battery.

First, let me thank you that you face up to the whole matter here, I devoted myself to a similar activity in public service for almost a decade, to say we were also arms bearers in the executive, but I won’t expand on it any further!
I find the question to the Right and the Left always very simplified.
Principally, however, one should say that the civil servant naturally comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary Left, that should be understood by everybody.
Of course, uniform and arms bearers attracting magically in particular people right from conservatives should be understood by everybody, and the fact that these people have real difficulties with handling the lived reality is naturally also obvious because you live nowadays with the average white person, but also with many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and with that I do not refer to the overly feminine cliche gay man because they do less or rather not at all exist in the executive, but rather quite normal men and women who go unnoticed unless they tell you about it) and I can and must rely on these people also, since in case of doubt they save your life or sacrifice their own for you.
But these fringe groups represent also a conservative attitude, according to my experience, even when it sounds strange to begin with, that is to say they are proud of Germany and feel rather left alone by excessive left politics even when those politics supposedly stand for them or rather states to have to please them, whereby they simply want one thing, namely to be treated quite normally.
Back to the Right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society you will also find extreme Rights there, however, that these people are allowed to express their opinion openly or even to plot some subversive plans is medially exaggerated and makes me also angry.
Of course it happens that specifically also police and soldiers who often served overseas begin to generalize often based on negative experiences and say sometimes things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that even right comrades-in-spirit meet who further a vivid exchange of thoughts.
In my view this is combatted pretty well and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is internationally so much involved and that has, in my opinion, its benefits, so that we cannot afford at all to have real racists and Nazis in our country!
Yes, however, I don’t understand it since I have ordered the other basket also on the German Page.
Why should that come from England?
When I ordered it the item was not sold out.
I have ordered it already in November.
but this was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
I am still referring to my order that can no longer be delivered.
Prior to that I chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one still might be able to deliver the other #PRS_ORG# black basket for #NUMBER# Euro  to Germany or is this basket also somewhere available in Germany.
I can find you only as partner company.
but at the upper edge of the wooden part there are two deep notches that were filled with some yellow filler
and the mirror itself shows a small scratch
More tidy due to child?
Hi, a subject keeps bothering me (f32) for quite some time.
At work I am very orderly and organized (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have been struggling to keep my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are phases where everything remains as is and then it gets to me and I tidy up and clean.
However, it does never really happen “ that someone could come to me spontaneously to visit”.
My husband (unfortunately) is not much better, it does bother me somehow but most of the time the household simply loses against work and reluctance.
The kitchen is being cleaned most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to become more tidy with a child?
We still don’t a child but we work on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for myself I have no motivation, it doesn’t really bother me as long as nobody comes visiting and e. g. clean clothes are always available and the kitchen is clean.
Are you motivated more with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted free movement.
Preforming with special wide embossment at the joints for improved free movement (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4 with the Flex System 2 the through the flex system covered area was more than doubled to increase comfort even further.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce any friction (armpit, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforming in the lower backside area and in the crotch provides a tight, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch-panel in the lumbar area increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves the comfort in particular when bending over and when mounting and putting on the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and at the back guarantees increased flexibility when moving your arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming water-resisting material with a special surface structure that offers great protection against cold.
Positioned on the chest it warms sensitive areas of the body.
Seamless thin (-2 mm) on the face at the hood increases the comfort, the seal and the fir (separate hood)
Soft zone in the collar improves the sealing with fine adjustable settings via a flexible gentle Velcro fastener that does not stick to the lining or to the seams
Double cuffs with zipper on arm and foot joints link a foldable interior cuff with a soft and lined Neopren exterior cuff
450 notch at the end of the interior cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when dressing.
Long zipper at the neck with Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-lock P back-zipper (overall without hood) with metal slide and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neopren reinforcements on all ends of the zippers to avoid ruptures in case excessive force is used.
Neopren panels are flush glued together with exterior and interior overlapping
Edges of the exterior cuffs are hemmed for better durability
Edges of the interior cuffs are notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fixate the computer at its place, especially with deep dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Careers in social work - as somebody with a avoidant personality disorder?
I accomplished my education in the software development sector and finished my studies about a year ago.
Unfortunately I’ve been noticing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me; therefore I consider for quite some time to start over again and to study social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant (or rather timidly avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking that means I have no self-esteem and I am accordingly rather shy.
I have no problem to speak with people on a factual level but I find it very hard to engage in casual conversations and I was told quite often that I seem to be unapproachable (whereby I personally believe that I have improved).
With that can I become a social worker?
I don’t want to work as a street worker or work in an open youth club but rather as educational consultant for example or in family support.
But I don’t know whether the concrete daily work routine is so as I imagine it and it is difficult to find something about it in the Internet.
The ÄVPS already causes problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because I feel down every time when my code is being questioned (“you loused up the most simple things again”) and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help (I should know by now how that works”/”I interfere with his work with my dumb questions”/”he must regard me as mentally retarded” etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have mentioned it here.
But you have already got back the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I’ve been waiting for a date for pick-up
What do you mean about ‘return’, please !
When I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG# the message pops up ‘your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was in Chat with #PRS_ORG# and he asked me whether I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
Birds break up the protein - they had consumed with their diet in their gastrointestinal tract - into separate amino acids, and from those they form their own endogenous proteins which they also need to form their plumage.
The forming of plumage with a nestling and the plumage renewal with a molting bird are extremely complex processes and extremely stressful for the animal’s entire organism.
Please note, that NEKTON-Bio must not been given during breeding since it might disturb the brooding process.
Consecutive to the treatment-like application of NEKTON-Bio one should change back again to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin product) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral product).

1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/soft feed as the bird consumes daily, and to change water/feed daily.
A level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds with 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
With severe plumage damages the double or rather triple amount of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the start until the onset of plumage formation becomes visible.
After that the normal dose is given until the plumage renewal has been concluded.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 150 and 250.
Excuse me please, but the chair is being sold as office chair.
How can an office chair be defective after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged at arrival and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community coworker in contrast to the statute
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be cut down.
So we filed a fall application at the municipality.
A coworker writes to me that cutting down fruit trees and thus also the walnut tree is not part of the statute.
The statute, however, mentions explicitly as to be protected tree.
Now, can I rely on the coworkers statement or not?
On the one hand I must be able to trust an expert’s opinion.
On the other hand the statute is very clear.
Many thanks for your replies
We understand that.
Then we will use this new packaging for it.
I did not receive any message
Alright, then I still have a sofa without having use for it.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, that I believe, the only question is whether I may pay in EURO and have the blanket delivered to me in Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious accident at Selb
A short while ago a serious accident happened on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alert just reports (14:03) a car drove in oncoming traffic when overtaking.
People were injured.
Ah, okay, understand.
Good, then many thanks again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First a Merry Christmas to all of you!
My Christmas was unfortunately only moderately good because my beloved mind mulls everything that it can mull.
Before I go into detail now ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who are somewhat familiar with my situation - namely from you.
I am a career changer and student teacher.
Originally I studied something else and also worked in an area (to remain at least a bit anonymous I won’t be more specific).
The whole thing, however, became too boring and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun for me.
Eventually I ended up with the studying to become a teacher and I was certain that is it - even though the environment is significantly less flexible compared to my previous job, but I didn’t care about it.
Now I have reached the third “I google other job postings”.
And only half a year has gone by.
On prior occasions I have always decided to continue and to at least finish my training, after that I can always change.
But now I am absolutely done with it.
Last month I had so little free time that I am completely exhausted.
Currently is vacation time but nevertheless there is a pile of work waiting for me.
Before my training I thought I would be stress-resistant but at that time my weekend was my weekend and evenings were my evenings.
Then I had free time.
And the stress at work did not matter at those moments.
Now I even find a family gathering to be stressful.
And then there are these rigid structures that nerve me additionally.
Principally I have fun and the training works also from the outside, regarding the feedback and others.
But I am completely exhausted and I ask myself how much stress can my body endure before it shuts down completely - if it hasn’t done so already.
I ask myself if I want to live the rest of my professional life in that way - especially when I read some of your contributions - or if I should return again to my old job where I was quite appreciated, where I could take my free times when I needed them, and where I found the work somehow boring but was paid adequately for it, and where I worked in a team and was not a lone fighter as it is currently the case most of the time.
But then I ask myself if I might reach the same point again in one year where I am now and feel dissatisfied.
You notice all that is somehow confusing but perhaps you as outsiders have some advice or ideas how I can escape from this situation, a situation where I am completely exhausted and begin to cry when I only think about it.
I won’t decide right now while I am so emotional because that would not lead to something good.
But perhaps your comments can help me to see at least some light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that would be sufficient for the time being.
Thank you for reading it and I apologize for the whiny undertone.
I hope that my situation has become clear at least a little bit.
The Valvetronix series from VOX has been consistently further developed since its introduction in the year 2001; among others that lead to a combination of the progressive modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit that reproduces perfectly the conduct of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we introduce a brand new modeling engine that represents the absolutely newest state of technology regarding sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology) that is based on the analysis of the components and the amp-circuits the VTX amplifiers produce an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps feature also the multistage tube amplifier.
It is partially based on real analog circuits because those handle the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply much better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit the VTX amps offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from where natural resonances just sparkle.
With the “Tone Room” software from VOX you can even correct and bend historic facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound in a way that you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube-sound and modeling technology is achieved first and foremost due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it was refined several times since then to satisfy sound requirements that were newly added; in 2010 that brought again a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and also numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers the new VT+ Valvetronix series was additionally so designed that all guitar players who search for a maximum sound diversity certainly find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, nuanced playback of play dynamics and string stops as well as a prompt response.
During a detailed analysis VOX engineers discovered that it is the output stage in particular that determines the tube character of an amplifier and, based on those findings, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit equipped with a 12AX7 tube of any VT+ amplifier maps perfectly the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The loosing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
The Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven points by his older brother Moritz.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro fastener dividers it is fitted to the needs of your camera equipment and thus suitable for any kind of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full format SLR cameras.
What actually fits into the rucksack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fit would be a DSLR camera with attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLR cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7-series or a Fuji X_T2 still have room for further lenses.
Besides that, you still have room for any amount of accessories.
If you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fuji film X-A or E-series) you may use the rucksack for your equipment and other non-camera items.
Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote and accessories.
Volcano eruption in La Palma: probably the longest one in history
Within hardly three months since the start of the eruption the lava streams caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days by now on Sunday the volcano eruption on La Palma is one of the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island.
Up to now with 84 days the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in the year 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the African west coast.
There are no reliable data about earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has somewhat seized during the past days but volcanologists didn’t dare any further prognoses when it could end.
The signs indicate a slowing down.
“The best news is that these indicators are stable”, the president of the island council, Mariano Hernandez Zapata, said to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
During the hardly three months since the start of the eruption the more than 1000 grade hot lava destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as TRVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered with meters thick lava layers.
That corresponds with almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at more than 900 million Euro.
Two new headlands with a size of about altogether 50 hectares originated off the coast through the cooled lava.
Heavy hit was in particular the banana farming that is so important for the island which directly or indirectly feeds about half of the 85000 inhabitants and that faced a crises even before the volcano eruption.
225 hectares banana plantations were destroyed, additional area severely impaired, wrote the newspaper “El Pais”.
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is coming and the children in particular can hardly await the heavenly feast.
The many colorful presents under the Christmas tree linked with the spiritual atmosphere and the bristling suspense are quite attractive.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional events that hold together our increasingly split society.
It is all the more important to appreciate the Christmas tradition of giving and thus the gesture of giving - a peacemaking “partnership agreement of primitive people” according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss - escaping from a rigid routine and able to revive it with life in the context of this tradition.
How Santa became the Christmas child
Strictly speaking it was the Protestants which linked the Christmas days tightly with giving presents.
Prior to that it was on St. Nicholas Day when presents were exchanged in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom that St. Nicholas as bishop of Myra supposedly through secretly gold in the windows of three women one night to spare them to live on in sin.
From this unconventional kind of giving originated the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots in particular of children with presents.
Protestants found this custom offensive because they reject mediators between God and the humans as “veneration of saints”.
These were the reasons for protesting against the institution.
Martin Luther created the Christ child from Nicholas and thus founded a new line of tradition.
Thus the focus of giving shifted to the Holy Eve.
Since most of the Protestants see those details not so narrowly any longer it still upsets only a few that the custom of the Holy Nicholas - similar to the Martin custom with Martin’s singing and St. Martin’s procession - is still firm part of the pre-Christmas season.
Nowadays you’ll find everything what your heart desires in the boots at the door and under the Christmas tree - from socks to popular luxury items.
Diverse traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas Day.
The Reformation shifted the day of giving to the Holy Eve.
In all countries inspired by Christianity, however, there is quite uncertainty about the question who actually brings presents to the children.
In Germany it rather depends on the respective region whether the Christ child appears on the Holy Eve or Santa Claus who is in principle a kind of Nicholas who was attributed with some characteristics over time.
Among those are e. g. his long white beard that has still little in common with the rather strict Assyrian bird of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeers and the preferred chimney to gain access to the homes.
In the Netherlands Santa Claus is the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain the Three Wise Men bring the presents, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who supposedly showed them the way to the Jesus child.
In Scandinavia it is sometimes mythical creatures that bring the presents, while in Russia it is Jack Frost who found some glory.
No reindeers here but rather three horses that pull his sleigh as troika.
In Czechia, the motherland of the reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ child is responsible for presenting the presents.

Police shoot an alleged bank robber near the royal palace
On Saturday an armed man was shot by the police near the Kensington palace in London.
The police informed that a caller had reported a man who allegedly went with a weapon into a bank and a bookmaker’s store.
According to the authorities’ information the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by authorities a bit later.
Shots were allegedly fired and the man was allegedly hit.
Still at the site of the crime he was declared dead.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area of the Kensington palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the Royal family are also living there.
which one?
No matter where I click on I immediately will be forwarded to your site.
The decorative light fits in harmoniously in every flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply installed and anchored with 2 pegs in the ground.
An integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module provides optimal charging of the integrated battery.
Maximum burn time 10 hours
- The robust plastic model can be used outside all year long.
In the Hollywood scene there are mostly menacing objects from far away galaxies that glow colorful on the inside.
The “Smart Stone” however is quite harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - either in white or in colorful light (altogether in six different colors).
The edgeless amorphous design was chosen on purpose: By day this modern light object presents itself like a natural large pebble stone.
Its organic roundness fits in every natural environment - either at the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in a rock patch.
It also looks great as larger pebble stone and boulder where it knows how to stand its ground.
You don’t need a lot of preparations: As solar light the “Smart Stone” needs no cables or batteries.
Just place the “light stone” in any place that enjoys sunlight during the day.
Two enclosed pegs provide firm support if needed.
The matt-white plastic sleeve itself is robust and weatherproof.
The “Smart Stone” hides the solar module discreetly in is interior together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other one for colorful light.
The battery is charged when sunlight hits the housing.
At dusk the “Smart Stone” starts to shine on its own, you determine the color: You have the choice of six attractive light colors - beside daylight white.
The “Smart Stone” turns itself off automatically as soon as the battery charging level had sunk to a given minimum, or when it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun is shining again the charging cycle starts on the next day from the start.
I did this several times, but it doesn’t work.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 was re-improved again.
A PWM frequency that can be variably adjusted from 10 kHz to 50 kHz enables super quiet operations especially with bell anchor motors - the typical “humming” is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adapted to even difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique “autotune” function makes the automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor possible.
With up to 1.5 A engine current the LokSound 5 decoder provides sufficient power even for older motors.

Problem with the pill
Hi, dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, in fact it is after one year of reddit my fist post.
About my problem: About five years ago I began again out of necessity to take the pill, especially because I had so unbelievably bad pain during my period and the shitty PMS before my period.
I would like to drop that again since I must take enough medications due to chronic illnesses that are not optional for me.
My skin problem, surprisingly not the pain but my skin.
I developed from 0 to 100 explosively pimples everywhere during my last about two-year-lasting pause.
They were superficially but it strained me quite a bit and I didn’t feel too well.
During the two years of the break the whole thing did not really turn normal again.
Perhaps somebody has any tips how I could avoid that this time.
My cosmetics consumption is already free of perfume and others but perhaps there is something that you could recommend.
Unfortunately, my gynecologist did not take me very seriously and a dermatologist appointment is coming.
Many thanks to you all who read through the novel!
Yes, the skin can create problems.
Pre-puberty I had bad neuro-dermatitis, then it quieted down a bit, then large-scale nodular lichen and then the acne problem.
I tried everything nutrition-wise along my chronic illness and got stuck with a sugar, milk and low-meat mix-diet because nothing else worked really properly.
It is also possible that my hormones simply do not work properly but when you have complaints everywhere you give up on searching for other dysfunctions.
I have already explained that to your colleague Semina or so
and now I’ve lost the contact and I don’t know what was replied to my request.
In between I constantly have to work and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone ...
what do you want to check if the money would be there I would have seen it
Please check my bank data perhaps there was an error
but in general you have it in large
since you have it available large in black

In the name of the People: Laypersons also pass judgement
In the court room they are seated on the judge’s bench clad in everyday clothes.
But very much depends on their judgement even though they don’t wear a robe: Lay judges determine together with professional judges whether and how long somebody might go to jail.
Two of the lay judges report about their time and the district court in Kreuznach in an interview with the “Öffentliche”: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the altogether 125 lay judges at the district court at the John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hi, unfortunately I cannot login to the customer account.

A new 110-kV-ground cable will be built in 2022
The permission for the laying of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legal.
The Lower Bavaria government’s zoning decision clears the way for the construction work that should start in 2022.
The network provider Bayernwerk in formed about that.
The about seven kilometers long ground cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kV-line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a tower of the overhead line near the town Erdmanning.
Good morning,
my order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with delivery number #NUMBER# had been sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note “Delivery not possible”.
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is certainly possible.
Can you tell me where we go from here?
Have a nice start into the week!
Forget about that since I already explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a sideboard made of glass and the entire sides are busted, so that glass lies everywhere and the cardboard is kaput
The sideboard is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter my flat due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations
That means that the sideboard can’t be picked up because nobody is allowed into my apartment
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EURO?
The original price for this chair was #NUMBER# EURO
No, it happens with all books, therefore the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, since it seems it is a general problem
Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hi dear colleagues,
I have been a student teacher since summer I like teaching but I have currently still major problems to time-efficiently plan my lessons for the subject Geography.
Unfortunately my school is technically not very well equipped so that I can principally only use the blackboard, the school book and an OHP as medium.
In the school I can only produce b/w copies free of charge (which is not sufficient for Geography).
I currently just need a long time to plan my hours.
Currently we talk about the subject Geo-factors for example and actually every hour is independent for me.
Principally the methods are always repeated but on the other hand I neither want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I need the time also for UBs ect.).
When planning I actually focus on the learning objectives (what do I want to achieve) and I think about how can I manage that (most of the time I produce work sheets with text from books which my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and I find most of the assignments in the book to be insufficient.
Also therefore the work sheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can tell me how you can work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would be happy about that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided on a new #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like the return to be processed as fast as possible.
Trade fears for the Christmas business because of the 2G-regulation.
Only who is vaccinated or recovered is still granted access to most businesses.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about drop in sales.
And it offers also a possible solution.
In the view of the Trade Association Germany (HDE) 2G-regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
Businesses with articles for non-day-to-day needs would complain about drops in sales, criticizes HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to the HDE’s current survey among 1100 retailers more than 70 percent of companies await negative results for the remaining days of the year.
Many of them supposedly already wrote off the Christmas business.
“What actually should be the positive highlight of the year is now a hole without bottom”, said Genth.
Retailers with 2G - access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crises sales in the past week.
It is only going well in food retailing and also in the online area.
The association demands consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concepts are a sure thing, said the managing director.
“2G when shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic”, he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and they require the use of many personnel.
The ribbon regulation should be admitted nationwide, he demanded.
After that every customer only needs to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and with the received ribbon he/she would have access to all stores on that day.
In addition random sample checks in the retail business - like already used in the public transport system with the 3G-regulation (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were lastly without 2G at well 75 percent of the pre-Corona-level, sales at about 90 percent.
These numbers will surely fall in the midst of that so important Christmas business”, said chief executive Wilhelm Wellner to the “Wirtschaftswoche”.
Based on the high personnel and administrative efforts one would try to find solutions for the centers and have them authorized.
The so-called ribbon solution is one of them where “visitors show their 2G-proof once e. g. at a central place in the center and then - equipped with a ribbon similar to a club hotel - may access all stores without interruption”. dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The mirror is scratched and the frame shows a defect that one tried to conceal with a yellow filler material.
That looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packaged and sealed the item.
How do I have to process the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance based on new flat SMD-LEDs with high performance and high color display.
A modern micro-processor with extraordinary possibilities adjusts the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
Beside the adaptation of the brightness there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set the color temperature manually in the range of 3100 - 5650K and to store it.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
Special characteristics of the controller: to operate it is easy and intuitive.
The lamp generates a light flux with soft light with high quality, completely flicker-free.
The output angle of 1200 is excellent, it lets you illuminate large areas at relatively small distances.
By the way also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adapt the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is an excellent tool that lets you work on a movie set or else in the studio.
The DMX512 controller, available optionally, enables remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the light is mounted in areas that are hard to access.
The backside of the lamp features a control board consisting of buttons and a illuminated display.
The display shows the current brightness settings in percent and the current color temperature in Kevin.
There you’ll also find the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User memory: The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To adjust the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces just press one of the memory buttons for a longer time and you are done.
The memory controller stores the current status of the lamp when turned off so that the known situation pops up again when you turn it on again - very practical when working in a studio when, e. g., the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
To work with batteries, one of the best features of the DL3120 functionalities, are a result from being able to operate the light with favorable NP-F batteries.
Photographers and camera men and women often already carry those items - so they have already existing equipment available.
Before the set the DL3120 can also check whether the batteries are sufficiently charged - a battery tester is integrated - a value is displayed for each of the two battery compartments (the left battery in the upper display, the right one in the lower display).
Furthermore it is also possible to supply the lamp continuously with power via the included power supply.
The structure of the lamp is rather simple.
A 16 mm sleeve connects the lamp directly with your tripod.
The incline can be adjusted reliably via fasteners on both sides.
We paid attention to the fact that the mechanical components are extremely sophisticated and therefore also designed for longevity and tough jobs.
The scope of delivery also contains an angle joint.
And a pocket is also part of the delivery.
That lets you transport or store the lamp and possible accessories that you still might want to buy without problems.
What a pity, it was given to me as a gift and it is too small :(
“Party which we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt celebrates after high-scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes the Hessians - who were recently without a win twice in series - were presumably on their way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE pulled itself together and, within a good hour, they shook off their frustration about a so-so season start and won furiously 5:2. “It is insane what the boys achieved today”, rejoiced coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave general praise “to everybody individually who took part in it”.
In the beginning it looked like a new loss for Frankfurt that now ranks number nine still trailing their expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought Leverkusen the lead with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
“How the players had come back again and showed a fantastic performance”, continued Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance that we displayed, and of course also with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz who could be in the game for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscular injury, praised the work ethics of his team colleagues.
“I believe that our mentality is incredibly big”, said the 27 years old and was happy with the results in particular for the spectators.
That was the party which we wanted to throw today.
However, for the upcoming tasks Glasner wants to stay focused and is rather positive about it in view of the good personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all our players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top shape.
It is thanks to the super work by our medical staff, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle.
Now one wants to go on “step by step and remain modest” and deal with the upcoming tasks “on this level” until year’s end.
Due to the English week next an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky) is scheduled already for Wednesday.
I just received the email that my package is returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# to redirect it, but no chance.
Can it be resent to me or do I have to wait until the money is returned and then place the order again?
But that would mean for me that I won’t place the order again since it took already a very long time.
Have you ever taken a seat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for handball-women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany’s handball-women left the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the conclusion of the WC main round the DHB team suffered a resounding defeat with a 16:32 (8:13) in Granollers in front of 800 spectators and now faces Spain in the quarter finals.
“We were much too timid and had too much respect for our opponent”, judged coach Henk Groener.
We have to perform differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind Denmark (10:0).
It is a shame that we couldn’t maintain the flow.
Everybody played bad, we have to forget about it”, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to reaching the semifinals a significant improvement has to happen against the WC-second placed from 2019 on the upcoming Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German scorer in the match against the three times Olympic winner Denmark was back-court player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
“We were simply not there - neither in offense nor in defense”, admitted back-court player Xenia Smits and demanded: “ We need to look forward very fast”.
Not on top of the game from front to back
Different from the previous five tournament games the German team was not up to snuff from the start.
Missed throws and technical errors in offense and gaps in defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was on top of her game immediately and prevented something worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored its first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels concluded a fast counterattack successfully.
However, this was not the hoped for initial spark.
The Herman women hardly found a concept against the aggressive Danish defense - and when they did they failed mostly due to the strong Scandinavian goalkeeper Althea Reinhardt.
The game had already been lost at an early stage at 3:10 after 20 minutes the more so as back-court player Mia Zschocke saw a bit later red due to a hard foul against her counterpart.
But she is allowed to participate in the quarter finals.
Only in the final minutes of the first half the DHB team found better to its game and narrowed the deficit to five goals until the break.
The anyhow only slight hope for a race to catch up after changing sides vanished after seven minutes at a 9:19.
Again the Groener team committed errors in all areas and thus made it easy for the well performing opponents who rank among medal aspirants for the final round.
Subsequently the German team could no longer pull itself together to improve its performance and left the court as clear loser.
DACH-Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas time
Within the Reddit-Advent calendar we came across the St. Nicholas Day and take this as an opportunity to dedicate some time to family traditions in the pre-Christmas time, the Advent, St. Nicholas, Holy Eve and the Christmas holidays.

Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful for the children?
The cleaning of boots?
Baking cookies?
Tree decorating?
Playing music?
Does Santa come, the Christ Child or is the present from Oma and Opa?
It does not matter how you do it, everybody puts in some efforts on and around Christmas to have it as good as possible as family.
Whether these are firm traditions or even something different each year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
please send me any transaction number.. or something else that could help
transfer confirmation... etc
I would like ti give away a voucher code
such as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
is that possible?
The title indicates that I work as vaccinator in a mobile vaccination team which (up to now) applies only the BioNTech/Pfizer-vaccination predominantly in nursing homes.
Since these teams are for the most part done soon I will continue my work partially in vaccination centers after that.
I gladly answer your questions about organizational and human aspects and also medical questions without time limit as long as they are not of personal nature (e.g. “I’ve been taking medication X is this compatible with the vaccination..”).
It is my job to enlighten you about the vaccination, the indications (a person can claim a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Act and there are no reasons contradicting it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
However, in the vaccination teams those assistants frequently do not accompany us “only” (by the love of God no missing appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccination preparation who do not (must not?) perform vaccinations so that I perform the most vaccinations myself.
Difficult “Huidlerer” question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a “Huidlerer”?
A dialect word send in by somebody from Amberg caused intense contemplation in the TV show “Wir sind Bayern” (we are Bavarians).
But other as on many previous days the term remained unsolved by the callers in the section “Host mi”? (Did you get it).
No, it was “nobody who is nervous”.
And still nobody “who hustles all the time”.
The people around the TV moderator claimed that to be completely wrong.
Consequently the man from Amberg shared the solution and probably thus caused quite an astonishment by many from the Upper Palatinate.
“The Huidlerer”, the spectators learned, “is a cloth with what you wipe your oven”.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley - who is consulted by the Bavarian TV as expert for years - confirmed it.
With the note this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somewhat derived from the known dialect word “Houdern”.
That had closed a gap in education - probably also with some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can’t to buy any more books for the last 2 weeks.
After the confirmation always the following error message pops up: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, linked it to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
The choice of tires for a racing bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train a bit more in preparation for my bike tour next week.
No sooner said than done and I drove off with my racing bike that I had bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 km were really great - but then something happened what is foreseeable in every inner city (this time: thanks to Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the road.
And there it was, a loud hiss and my rear tire didn’t want to comply at all for the rest of my route.
Since I had no opportunity due to the work day to purchase a spare coat and hose I had to turn around again halfway bad tempered and took the first train back home.
It was not quite that bad regarding my mood perhaps it was better that way that I practice a tire change before the bike tour.
But now, however, I face a question and hope you can help me.
Since I will face a long distance over several days I would really seek to avoid this problem occurring more frequently.
Now it is not at all so bad since I drove the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man who covered 120 km until 14:00 on the day when I came to pick up the bike!) and who regarded the tires as sub-optimal since he had driven with them on rollers for several years.
But when I imagine that I have to change a tire after 80-90 km while on tour then I would really be pissed :D
Now I started a conversation with an elderly man on the train platform who asked me quite surprised why I wouldn’t have Marathon Plus tires; those would be puncture-proof.
The whole thing sounded of course quite plausible.
But are they really so puncture-proof?
I am not very keen on purchasing 40 €/tires only to be disappointed again.
And I have another question: currently I have 25x622 tires on my racing bike.
They are also available (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires but newer ones are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to get different tires for a racing bike?
The swallow-site seems to recommend my absolute! layman knowledge to prefer the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and best regards!
Car crashes against tree: Driver fatally injured
As the police reported the 53 years old man crashed with his car against a center island for unexplained reasons on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and landed subsequently on the opposite lane.
There he collided frontally with the vehicle of a 27 years old man.
The car of the 53 years old was then hurled against a tree and the man was wedged in the car.
The 27 years old as well as his 23 years old passenger were seriously hurt in the accident and transported to hospitals nearby.

Do I get a mail confirmation for that?
I was assured of that already 3 times by your colleagues ... how reliable is your information?
When will the carrier get in touch with me?
I have already written to you, didn’t you get my SMS?
After publishing our new high end broadband B 100- 6 OHM it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would also produce an offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offshoot and it reminds us of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this proposed design directly integrated a suitable designer foot to lift the loudspeaker up to the correct audio position.
This foot does not interfere with acoustics and its length can be adjusted corresponding with the environment at home.
From its principle the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people where the maximum volume level is of less importance, however, where the sound quality should reach an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker simply can’t manage to produce nearly unfiltered such great sound pressure levels.
But that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, the SOLO 15 presents itself notably adult and is extremely impressive and accurate considering its size.
Tonally the SOLO 15 was fine-tuned with a slight increase in it high range.
This is quite common with broadbands in order to optimize the bundling that very much increases with high frequencies.
If aligned perfectly to the listening position the SOLO 15 convinces with its clear and fine sound.
Slightly turning the SOLO 15 to the outside can reduce the treble range and thus make the sound pattern warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source the tracking of individual components of a music piece is razor-sharp and astoundingly precise.
The exemplary extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide fine dynamics which are unrivalled.
The SOLO 15 thus not only supplements our SOLO series but rather expands it in terms of resolution capacity and accuracy.
As with all our kits it is recommended to think about the final visual appearance of the loudspeaker in order to include respective changes when building it.
For example, if you want the housing veneered the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adapted respectively since the veneer adds more material.
After all plates were cut to size (e. g. in a DIY store) you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the base plate at the respective position so you can insert the cable later without problems.
With the help of a router you produce the loudspeaker opening in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the backside this opening should be fitted with a 450 chamfer in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis in the interior as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 6 OHM thus receive outages in the chamfer as shown in the picture “Detail chamfer”.
Then you start with the proper assembly of the box and place one of the two side walls in front of you on an even surface.
Glue now the backside, the top, the front and the bottom to the side panels.
With that the three braces should also be inserted and stuck together.
The braces can vary in their material strength, e. g. if needed if you to use the finished trims from the DIY store and if you don't want to produce them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The second side is assembled in the next step.
Then follow all plates of the foot - both sides and also the front.
A suitable circular hole saw or a Forstner bit make it easier to drill the opening for the bass-reflex pipe and to attach the terminal clamp to the backside.
Subsequently you use a round cutter to round off the edges of the actual box.
With that you may also round off the top side of the base plate.
Subsequently you firmly glue the base plate to the base of the housing and additionally screw it on with long wood screws.
After that mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill) the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the terminal clamp.
After removing the wood dust from the housing (vacuum / blow) you start inserting the cable.
You do this best by leading the cable through the 35 mm bass-reflex opening in the backside.
Slide the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm bore hole into the base up to the terminal opening and let it stick out there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing slide the cable to the loudspeaker opening and let it also stick it out loosely.
After that prepare and insert the crossover.
You find the blueprint of the crossover as well as the respective wiring diagram in the following document: Assembly instructions Crossover Solo 15.
After inserting the crossover and tightening the connecting terminal with screws you seal the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box which has not yet been completely closed.
With some skill you may let hot glue drop on the 35 mm bass-reflex opening and thus seal it.
You may check the seal respectively through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small light.
Now follows the dampening according to description.
Subsequently you connect the B 100 - 6 OHM and screw it down with respective screws.
The polarity is here very important so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered onto the positive terminal of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally you must shorten the bass-reflex pipe to the indicated length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe), and insert it.
Cut the pad of the damping material in two parts for damping and distribute it loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass-reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order right now and have delivery scheduled for the beginning of June?
> Hi there, you all,
> finally we can announce that we host again the OSCAST this year!
> For known reasons it is unfortunately not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio which caused increasing planning efforts and explains the announcement on such a short notice.
BUT: There will be at least three people per transmission so that we and hopefully thousands of you can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But remember, the pandemic is still with us - but we will try everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> We will start at about 0:30.
Put your drinks already in the icebox, plan some good food and get ready for a long but also very interesting night.
