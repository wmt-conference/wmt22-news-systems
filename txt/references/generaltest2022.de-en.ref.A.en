The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee would equal 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# a serious customer and that is why it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or a instructions what I should attach to the package so that it can be traced by you all as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago...for €249.
Now it costs €179.
That really bothers me, I must say.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way of getting the credit?
I also think that as a general rule, children should not be expected to overtake a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to care for the younger ones to some degree.
Sometimes check-up on them, sometimes help, sometimes get the bottle, etc.
They learn responsibility this way, help within the family and are thus connected with it.
As long as they can continue to be a kid themselves, I don’t see the problem.
If your first child looks after themselves alone for a short amount of time, that is OK, that is actually good.
You can best get a sense of whether or not this works for your children.
It is not as if they should change the second child’s diaper and sit for hours by them as they fall asleep.
It is probably questionable from a strictly legal perspective.
Maybe the psychologist would also have something to say about it.
Since if something actually does happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for child 1 to take care of child 2.
If that is a risk that you would like to take that is up to you, of course ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a myster/thriller a few years back and I can basically still remember the entire plot, but the title escapes me, maybe someone here knows differently...
The story is about fear and treating fear.
At the beginning of the story, a veterinarian commits suicide by covering himself in feed and going into the cage of a carnivorous cat.
The case is taken up by a commissioner, who after a short investigation goes to his therapist who runs a clinic for patients with phobias.
The commissioner has a young niece, who also as a phobia (of fire) and who is also with this therapist.
More suicides take place and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of the suicide and to document it and post these photos on the internet.
At any rate, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground therapy, where the patients are implanted with a chip, which suppresses the fear center of the brain and in the end the patients face their fears in the most extreme ways.
(a woman jumps out of a window, another one drives herself to death on purpose)
Facing fear this way is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end, there is a great showdown in the clinic, which involves a fire.
That is the plot in broad strokes, I am positive that the book was originally written by a French author.
In case this story rings a bell for anyone, or if you could even tell me the name of the book, I would be so happy.
Oh yeah, I don’t have access to the WiFi password anymore.
I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a minute.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get back a transfer back for the price difference?
Child, four-years-old, splinter under the thumbnail
A child of four has gotten an entire wooden splinter under their thumbnail (on the outside).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn’t work and caused pain.
Now the child is hysterical whenever we try.
No way this is working.
Tomorrow, it’s to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module into a single circuit board, we manage a size of only 30 mm x 15.5 mm and can thereby be built into nearly every locomotive of the track gauge H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoder is offered with all standard interfaces and always comes with a 11 x 15 mm “sugar cube” loudspeaker in addition to a sound capsule kit.
The LokSound 5 is a real multi-protocol decoder like all the members of the family.
It supports the file format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
The DCC format includes 14 to 128 speed levels, which is just as self-evident as 2 and 4 digit address and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder automatically reports back to a suitable digital command center.
It is proficient in all DCC programing modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV value can be read out on the main platform with the appropriate command center.
There are support registers for command centers that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels and 255 addresses.
Three further Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode makes re-programming possible even with the venerable 6021 control unit.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic reporting to mfx® compatible command centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking distance as well as the ZIMO® HLU braking command or the Lenz® ABC system.
Even braking using DCC braking components or DC voltage is possible.
Furthermore, it also stops for a Selectrix® braking diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle allows for automatic shuttle traffic between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be implemented on analogue DC and AC current trains.
Since my return credit, which I never received, was no longer extended as would be fair, I would like to take my order valued at about
€#NUMBER# out of my shopping cart and just order somewhere else, where friendliness to customers is more highly valued and I don’t have to type all night in order to accomplish nothing!!
What am I supposed to do with this number??
Omicron’s why: Johnson wants to push booster shoots
The increase in Omicron cases is concerning for politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
That is why all qualified adults in England should receive a vaccine before the new year.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson would like to increase the rate of Corona booster shots with an eye on rapidly increasing Omicron figures.
Every adult in England should really have the chance before the end of the year to receive a booster shot as long as three months have passed since the first immunization, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video announcement to his countrymen.
The previous goal had been the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that the vaccination campaign can also be accelerated in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Because of the Omicron variant, we are in an emergency situation, which is why vaccination protection really needs to be increased, Johnson said.
It seems the good news is that the level of protection increases after a third vaccination dose.
“Let’s get boosted!”, Johnson said.
1,239 additional Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain on Sunday, which puts the total number at 3,137.
This was an increase of 65 percent in comparison with the previous day. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I have sent out an application.
Today an invitation for an interview came in the mail.
I would like to respond to the email.
Unfortunately the name isn’t “Peter” but a more complicated name.
I tried to google it and according to what their cultural background is, they could be either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how I am supposed to write the email.
Can someone help me with it?
**I am a foreigner and don’t want to step on the toes of some clerk.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
A total of 5 books are on it.
4 of those work.
Only the one that I bought today doesn’t work
Apparently the stool had an unnoticed issue when it was sold.
How could damage to the upholstery just pop up like that after 9 months?
I first tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has not been functioning for about
14 days now.
That is why I have been buying the books via the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but would like to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like that you add 2 more chairs to the order and send me the bill.
[CW] The feeling when I can’t help.
Content Warning: I will describe domestic violence here in some detail.
I just really need to write something straight from the soul.
I (21) often come in contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence because of my job.
Something that has really been bothering me, and which really comes up too often, is that many victims don’t let themselves find help and think that we cannot help them.
It is clear to me that we can’t do everything and that we are not perfect.
However, there are few things in my line of work that bother me more than when I am not able to do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even during private conversations far away from the eyes and ears of the perpetrator I am not able to make progress.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of retribution, fear of leaving the social environment you are used to, fear to rip children from this environment.
What I would like to make clear for everyone, partially on the verge of tears myself, is that everyone deserves to live life without violence.
I would like for all women know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish that I would be able to help out in this case...I know that I can’t.
It doesn’t make it any easier though.
Please think about the fact that you are worth more than living with violence, that is so important.
“Arcane” on Netflix: What is the series’ relation to “League of Legends”?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, breathtaking presentation: “Arcane,” the series that takes place in the “League of Legends” video game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the two seasons that were announced?
National basket ball league: Derby-Debakel, MHP Ludwigsburg Giants at Merlins Crailsheim
At least the youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing, again: For the second time within less than three months the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
John Patrick, the trainer for Ludwigsburg, said before the game in reference to the previous finals loss in the beginning of October to HAKRO Crailsheim Merlins that: “We are still angry about it”.
But this was note put to rest after the game, but rather it increased once again after the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the basketball league.
It wasn’t just the score that was disappointing, but also the way they showed up.
A statistic was given for this which expresses the whole dilemma: The triple quota was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) and a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: “We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Teneriffa and we didn’t put into practice what we had trained.”
They just didn’t move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted much differently: “It was an awesome game winning for the second time against Ludwigsburg,” the happy coach said.
“It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people.”
750 people were let into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, and they got what they paid for.
Not least of all because of the BBL top shooter T.J. Shorts, who landed 22 pointes and steered the game for his team.
“The best player, who I have ever trained,“ said Gleim in praise.
While at the same time on Patricks Team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed when they got to the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points, after which they were knocked back down to 39:59.
Not just Johannes Patrick but Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
There was luckily not a lot of time to fight.
On Wednesday (7 PM) the giants will already host Skyliners Frankfurt in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We had another mail address earlier, but I changed it.
Yes, I already contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately at that point all warranty claims were turned down.
We informed ourselves about our rights and that is why we are writing you again.
We originally contacted you a half a year ago.
Always spick and span: Max Raabe turns 59
He excited his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At that time he was working with the program “Guten Tag, liebes Glück” - when he was allowed to appear there.
This weekend Max Raabe really wanted to celebrate his birthday on Sunday on stage in Leipzig.
Nothing will come of it.
The already planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - “at the request of the authorities,” in order to dampen the corona virus.
Other concerts of his planned for the Christmas season had to be cancelled first, as is stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
In January the artist wants to catch up on his appearances that have all already been postponed since 2020 because of the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen in North Rhein-Westphalia, Max Raabe already enjoyed singing as a teenager whenever he could.
In Berlin he trained as an opera singer and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with his classmates.
Since then the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded a number of prizes.
His live album from the “MTV Unplugged” series (2019) reached second place on the charts - just like his breakout album “Für Frauen ist das kein Problem” (2013).
He was able to make something mainstream out of something niche.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair combed back and with a sense of decorum, the contemporary German-speaking musical landscape is impossible to imagine without Max Raabe.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program “Guten Tag, liebes Glück.” dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to order a small example of the furniture wood?
It needs to expand on furniture which is already here, so we have got to check if the color works
It is still not working, I can only see the front page but I can’t turn the page.
Federal Construction Minster Klara Geywitz: No new apartments will come as a result of expropriation
The new Federal Construction Minster Klara Geywitz (SPD) spoke against the expropriation of large housing corporations as has been required by a referendum in Berlin.
“No new housing is created with expropriation, it just changes the way property is structured,” Geywitz said in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give security to renters that their rent stays affordable in the years to come.
A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives and housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly anyway.
A coalition of the SPD, Greens and the Left would like to deploy an expert comission to figure out how best to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not calm itself down, Geywitz determined, discussions with the FDP in the Streetlight Coalition about further intensification of rental rights are not off the table.
The coalition agreement stipulates a rent freeze extending to 2029, placing a limit on rental increases in tense housing markets along with the expansion of the rental index.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to order to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not become more bearable, then “we will speak with our partners in the coalition about further measures,” emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I would like to order something and something occurred to me after a few days, that I forgot about the last step of the payment.
Our product isn’t available anymore, unfortunately.
Do you know when it might be in stock again?
Or whether it will come back again at all?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Store credit sounds great.
Then I will certainly just use it for the new order.
Thank you for clearing this up so quickly!
If the lamp is sent out in March, how long with the delivery itself take?
I already cut my finger
This is absolutely absurd
At least 100 dead following a tornado in Kentucky
Numerous tornadoes tore through the USA during a devastating series of storms.
There were more than 100 deaths in Kentucky alone.
Images from the area look like a warzone.
Many tornadoes simultaneously laid waste in the USA on the night on Saturday and most likely caused hundreds of deaths.
The storms left a stretch of devastation about 320 kilometer long, mostly in the state of Kentucky.
Following a visit to the disaster zone, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear said everything was gone wherever the tornado tore through.
Houses, stores, government buildings - just gone.
Parts from industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that that is even possible.
He is going with the figure of at least one hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky, the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that the Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That is a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been taken out of the inventory entirely?
Is it possible to order this Vitrine in another country?
when will you get back to me?
If the delivery cannot be carried to my apartment, I must cancel my order!
I get that now but can I order the lid now, which is in the shopping cart, and have it delivered to Germany?
I used the contact form to return an article, or rather to submit a return, and wanted to check up on if that had come in or was being processed since I haven’t had a confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and other slogans
While the federal government has turned down the motion for a vaccination bonus once again, companies in Austria have taken up the initiative themselves and offer their employees remuneration for vaccination.
In that way they are together with the Austrian Federation of Trade Unions and the chamber of commerce, who are pushing for financial incentives for vaccinations.
Readiness to have a Corona vaccination has also increased thanks to the tweaking of vaccination slogans on the German example.
He has moved to a company that he used to complain about.
That doesn’t make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink some tea.
It was a year ago.
He obviously was not nailed down into his old position and decided to search somewhere else.
You are able to do that.
The fact that he didn’t like it back then: whatever.
He didn’t find his other job good either.
There are too many variables.
Please start the cancellation process.
Then it will be legally relevant.
I took a screen shot.

Help with my very first campaign
Boron here!
I am currently guiding a group of 4 friends through the adventure “Over the Greifenpass” and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into one of my own campaigns written just for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The large strokes are complete, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought through and now I am working on writing the initial adventure, but I am already stumbling over myself in the first encounter.
The premise is that the hero should bring a cart with grain from Gratenfels into a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the plot should develop further.
A group of goblins should waylay the heroes a few miles away from the village and lock them into an ambush.
I would like to give the playable characters the possibility to solve the confrontation in a number of ways: They can persuade, trade, pressure, recognize the danger quickly, whatever occurs to the players.
Strength of group: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they are not noticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a narrow pass, three of them on both the left and the right side flanking the cart, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it should come to a fight and the heroes are defeated, then there are two possible outcomes
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are finally found and healed by the son of Dorfschulzen, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeated proves inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his squires and comes to help the heroes.
The cart is still there, everything’s great.
How appropriate do you find the Deus ex Machina in solution 2?
Is this too much for an initial encounter in Abenteuer?
The group of goblins will play a decisive roll later, they are not just there as cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect to have so many answers, especially with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas to heart and now have more trust in my narrative.
I have taken apart the lamp once more.
And assembled it back together.
Unfortunately it still is not working.
That is why I would like to send it back
Could you send over the return receipt, then I can pack up the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

the rip appeared all at once
I just sat down on it
This is where the lower part was damaged, that is, the part with the storage space.
Will it all be picked up again or just the storage section?
I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post.
First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1.
It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!).
Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here.
It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end.
In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident.
In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn’t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed.
Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton.
The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster.
It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules.
In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste.
But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion.
Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher.
This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously.
Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters.
You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages.
The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1.
In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements.
At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be really interested in your opinion.
This one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, there’s an item that should have been delivered last week and which still hasn’t been delivered.
I contacted the chat line twice but haven’t heard anything.
The first lady told me that it was sent on Monday, the second lady said yesterday that she would check and send an email but she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them demonstrated a defected after a relatively short amount of time (there is a hole in the material on the from side.
I ask for your support.
Air pumps are especially suitable for providing an aquarium with extra oxygen.
A filtration system can also be operated through an airlift pump.
We offer 3 variations in this series.
Take a look at the table at the end of this offer.
That is where you can see a comparison of services.
If the pumps are strong enough, then you can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, then a pump with two or more outlets would be make sense so that you can connect multiple jets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets depending on the model; air pumps are also useful if you want to put some accents into your aquarium, in order to have an air curtain (check our shop) or decor, which transfers the air current into a function.
A treasure chest, clam or something similar would be just the thing here.
The MK series has a special, silencing construction that allows for very little operational noise.
Installation is very simple.
The air pump is connected is connected to an outlet jet with a 4/6 mm ventilation tube...and then you are ready to go.
The air pump should be set at the same height or higher than the water level and fixed to the outside.
If the air pump is sitting lower than the water level, then you should setup a check valve in-between.
Just cut the ventilation tube and set the valve between the two parts.
This should prevent the case in which water runs backwards through the pump and out of the basin...
If the air pump is being used outside, then it should be covered and protected from humidity just like any other air pump
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that use little energy
Even if we are asking for 3 days processing time here on eBay, they are packaged daily and the packages are picked up here everyday.
If everything goes well en route, then it goes quickly.
We just want to make sure that no one is upset just because it takes a little longer.
It seems to be the case that not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in shipping...of course Corona isn’t stopping for anyone here.
Please don’t rate us poorly immediately, just because the delivery has been delayed; this is usually the fault of the shipping service.
It’s easy to be grumpy with these services, even if we have all been saying recently that they have it quite hard
This also differs greatly from region to region.
Don’t be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow one with, and without, armrests?
Can one also order the legs in a brighter shade?
Amazon Founder Bezo sends astronaut’s daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four more passengers will undertake a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday from the rocket system “New Shepard” from the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin.
The launching and landing of the circa ten minute flight took place in the west of Texas in the USA.
Bezos personally greeted the astronauts following their landing in a very personal fashion underneath a beaming blue sky.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, who was wearing a blue space suit as he opened the hatch of the capsule.
The six passengers climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder in the midst of applause from friends, family and coworkers at Blue Origin.
According to reports from Blue Origin they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew with NASA into space in 1961 and from whom the rocket system of Blue Origin gets its name, and the fifty-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were the special guests of the company; the other four passengers paid for their tickets: The spaceship engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick and technology entrepreneur Lane Bess as well as his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not reveal how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley thinks back after the short flight on the mission of her father.
He worked hard during his deployment and always was doing things himself.
They had just flown along, the 74-year-old said with a smile.
Even Michael Strahan let his excitement show.
He would really like to go right back up into space, the moderator said.
“New Shepard” flew up to a height of 100 kilometer
The rocketing system “New Shepard” was flying automatically for the most part.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometer above the earth, briefly hanging in zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again after being slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviary Association and many other experts view 100 kilometer above the earth as the border of space, that being said, there is no binding international consensus.
This has then been the third manned space flight of Blue Origin: The first time in June: Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot as well as an 18-year-old from the Netherlands.
The second time in October: the ninety-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner came along, who is famous around the world for playing the role of “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek”, apart from that, the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers came too.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely making a business of space tourism that is void of any scientific research interest that could benefit humanity and that they are doing so without taking into account environmental damages.
By pressing a button, you can easily select whether your “Smart Stone” will stay on one color or play out the entirety of its color repertoire.
If it is set to change color, the stone keeps its color of light for about a minute before softly transferring over to the next decorative tone.
The solid construction of the “Smart Stone” light keeps it protected outside the whole year through.
In a snowy environment, the light is especially nice - although briefer light times should be expected as soon as the days get shorter.
Please just make sure that the snow doesn’t effect the functioning of the solar module in winter.
“Smart Stone” uses a NiMh battery in common format (“AA”), which can be switched out easily if needed.
You can find the right replacement batteries in our online shop and thereby further lengthen the usage life of your decorative light.

Someone who works in bio chemistry or studied bio chemistry
I am now studying bio chemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject itself rather exciting and standing around in a laboratory doesn’t bother me (I’ve already got the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Naturally, I informed myself about carrier outlooks before I began the study program and thought at the time and actually still do think that I do want to get a PhD and that I will get one.
At the moment, however, there are some doubts, especially as far as carrier choices are concerned.
On the one hand you always hear (Studycheck, etc.) about really great carrier chances and that the profession is really in demand, but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and really poorly paid positions.
And that is why I would be really interested to know:
1) What are you working as right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/pay?
3) What did you study/Which vocational training did you receive?
4) Would you do the whole thing all over again?
Thank you very much for your answer!
I am unsure at the moment and am considering to possibly brake off the study program in 2022 and do vocational training as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience there, just write me :)
Extra stress from vacations and holiday weekends
This was a topic for me last week.
But I now need to use my long weekend in order to relax.
But first I’ll post about it.
At the office, there is not just stress from large holidays, like Christmas.
There appears to also be stress around days off and “bridging days”.
That was really the case: Last week was Assumption Day, which we call “Ascension Day” in Switzerland.
Most people and businesses have an extra day off before the weekend on Friday, a so-called “bridge day”, which is semi official.
That is, I was home for a long 4 day weekend last week.
What was up last week?
Constant stress.
Tons of emails, which certainly had to go out before Ascension Day, an order here, an order there, everything *must* be done before the long weekend.
Well because...?
Because “not till next week” sounds like so much time and that isn’t allowed?
Because the people in all honesty want to accomplish as much in a short week as they do in a normal one?
I wasn’t just stressed on Wednesday, but I was royally annoyed.
What’s up with this self-flagellation from the holiday?
Why do we have days off then, if we are not able to really enjoy them?!
The stress was not coming from up top, mind you, the coworkers were all doing it themselves of course.
My question is simple: Are the Swiss the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed Evangelical manner?
Or do you also do this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is happy about Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy about Christmas in her hometown in Thüringen - but still doesn’t have any presents.
“The beautiful thing is that even if there is not supposed to be any snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest,” the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
They are going to join in on the festivities, at which she will bake cookies with her son and do crafts.
“I love it,” Catterfeld said.
She still has a few things to figure out before those tranquil days: “For the first time I don’t have any presents, I really need to just get out there.”
NEKTON Bio supports a smooth process of molting and coat formation.
NEKTON Bio contains all necessary vitamins, antacids, minerals and trace elements necessary for life as well as 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio gives birds a smooth and shiny coat.
The majority of plumage damage that occurs while keeping birds can be traced back to issues of diet.
Because the plumage is made out of a substance that contains protein, an especially rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the creation of a perfect coat of feathers.
The daily feed must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements for a functioning metabolism.
Most animal losses during molting occur because of a lack of protein or an unbalanced feed and/or an insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON Bio explicitly takes this into account and corrects for the insufficient proportion of amino acids in most plant-based feed.
No further vitamin compound should be taken while using NEKTON Bio.
NEKTON Bio can be dissolved in cold water and is very easy to administer through drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still is not working
GDR handicraft model old-style E-Locomotive E95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, item is used with traces of play and missing parts, see photos, functions well, the E95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive from the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for traction heavy coal wagons in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small production company ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN.
A locomotive can be found in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is put into comission
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft asked the AEG in 1924 for suggestions on a electro-powered locomotive, which could transport 2,200 tonnes of coal carts and 530 tonnes of passenger carts at a travelling speed of 45 km/h along this route.
The requirement for highspeed was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG therefore decided on the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with an AEG axel-hung drive along with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckert company with the electrical part.
Between December 1927 and June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives was received with the operating numbers E95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves within the territory of what would become the GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives landed in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They were then sent back to Germany in 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair depot in Dessau, the value of a renovation of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the progressing re-electrification of the central German network produced an increased need for heavy goods transport, the three locomotives E95 01 to E95 03 were restored in 1959, which left the remaining machines to serve as a source for spare parts.
Thus the preferred construction was initially the E04, E44 and E94, which were already available in large quantities.
As was first apparent with the E94, the reconditioning could not be increased further, which left the E95 as the central object of renovation.
[4] Initially the locomotives were stationed at the train depot in Leipzig-Wahren.
In 1960, they arrived at the train depot Halle P.
They were deployed on their own running schedule, usually guiding coal trains from the Geisel valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated controls of the locomotives proved problematic as they grew older.
It happened on multiple occasions that gates stayed closed during switching operations.
The co-conductor would constantly have to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the gate again during the trip.
There were often damages to drive motors, which would turn the locomotive out of comission for months.
[5] Because there were enough modern locomotives available at the end of the 1960s, and there was no major expansion of electronic operations planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could go without the old locomotives and most of the splinter types, such that the E95, were put out of operation.
It was also that case that the German Reichsbahn only wanted to have a single electronic locomotive in their possession, which had become a problem during railway operations because of “difficulties” with the machines and the visibility conditions in the driver’s cab.
[5] After the E95 02 and the E95 03 were put out of comission in mid 1969, the E95 01 soon followed in their tracks and was taken off the tracks on October 5th 1970.
The new designation that was intended, 255 001, was thus never used.
All of the locomotives except for the E95 02 were dismantled.
The E95 02 was installed as a replacement for the soon-to-be museum locomotive E77 10 as a heating system for Halle Central Station.
It took awhile before those responsible in the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E95 was worth keeping as a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the initial outer refurbishing of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it as a vehicle display in RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since then belonged to the Transportation Museum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the interior refurbishing of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) looks after the locomotive as a historic piece.
Since 1995, employees of the Tradition Society Bw Halle P have been working on getting the locomotive back in operation.
In April 2015, the locomotives could first be presented at an exhibition in the locomotive depot museum in Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paint, at which time the transformers were examined and five driving motors were operational.
-Since 1945, the locomotives have been deployed on the Silesian Gebirgsbahn and its branching routes, where they have proven themselves with their reliable motor and limited maintenance requirements.
The machines were then given a new home on the central German network in Leipzig in February 1945.
The main deployment area was initially Silesia
The handicraft model H0 in OVP, functions well, visual refinishing of the locomotive is necessary on your end, dusty, looks used, smells like a basement !!!, a very rare handicraft model, very limited edition, the construction kit is possibly from the small series producers ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN
The packaging could have labels attached and bear traces of storage.
Yes, it is the F parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there was a problem with one of the pieces.
The central beams are held by two feet...unfortunetly these are too small and the beams won’t attach to the feet.
What should I do now?
I can’t build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which were produced incorrectly.
The middle beam doesn’t fit into the intended mount.
Which is why I’m getting a new one.
When will it be sent out?
no they aren’t flat.
According to the assembly instructions they are the correct ones for the design, they were just too narrow
But whatever.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose.
Mine are not flat
Could I get ones sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem once more?
Apartment fire causes two people light injuries and a lot in damages
Two people were lightly injured in an apartment building fire in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, property damages estimated in the six figures occurred as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire probably broke out from a carport at the neighboring apartments in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
Two residents were brought to the hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday according to reports.
The exact source of the fire was not initially known, but the police do not believe at this time that it was intentional arson.
Fürstenfeldbruck criminal investigations have taken over further investigations.
However, they don’t get back till much later
And I still need to pay the delivery costs
In order to rebut fake news, the Biontech CEO published a vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination from the beginning of 2021 on the social network “LinkedIn”
Biontech head Uğur Şahin had previously not discussed his immunization status publicly.
Now the businessman is publishing a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
The sickness of his friend brought him to do it, said Şahin.
CEO and cofounder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo that showed how he received an immunization against the Corona virus.
There was incorrect information on social networks that I was actually not vaccinated.
Actually my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer immunization,” Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the “LinkedIn” platform.
“For the last few months friends of mine have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting immunized in order to clear up this untrue rumor”.
He had been putting it off up until now, because he didn’t want to make the conversation about himself.
But a call in the past weeks changed his mind: “I was deeply touched, as I discovered that an old school mate of mine was fighting for his life.
He was fighting against a serious Covid 19 infection and had been attached to a breathing machine for three weeks.
The school mate and his family are not immunized, said Şahin in his statement.
He didn’t ask why.
“The most common cause seems to be fear, which is usually stirred up by false information and mistrust.”
It is difficult to conquer fear with facts, that is why sometimes it’s better to just share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle was circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin said that he was not immunized.
However, this video was made in December 2020 as Deutsche Welle was clear about.
“It is not legally possible for me to receive the vaccination,” said Şahin back then.
There were priority groups for receiving the vaccination in Germany.
The priority groups have long since been removed - and the Biontech head had since been vaccinated three times according to his statements.
Fire in the switchyard: Ten-thousand people without electricity
The light went out in multiple municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday night: no more electricity, in many cases the heating also went out.
A fire put a switchyard out of comission.
After a fire that caused serious damages in a switchyard, tens of thousands of people in Rhein-Sieg county in North Rhein-Westphalia had to manage without power for about 24 hours.
The lights went out for about 41,000 residents in multiple municipalities on Friday evening because of the fire.
The utility company Westnetz reported that on Saturday there were numerous back-up generators in operation up until the disturbance that effected such a large area could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
The fire brigade and contributors to the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) provided support to the communities.
The departments offered support stations inside of schools and called on neighborly assistance.
The supplier thanked those effected for their patience and their help during the operation.
It is very clear to us that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions along with it.
We are also thankful to the effected communities, the county, the fire brigade and the THW for their enduring commitment during deployment,” head of primary technologies, Florian Witt, said in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repairing of damages will begin in the next few days, since the Westnetz technicians can only temporarily restore operation to some services, he explained.
A technical defect was responsible for the fire, according to company statements.
Energy is flowing again
The company states that the fire, which broke out at 7:15 PM on Friday, caused serious damage in the switchyard of the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid sections of the 10,000 Volt substation.
That is where serious cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, connection was made to a 30,000 V system.
The energy supply was restored again thanks in part to this bypass.
21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have been living with electricity since 6 PM on Saturday.
Starting at 9:30 PM, a further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had at least partial power restoration.
Since 11:15 PM, the last of the electricity that was out since the failure was restored.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The public departments called for additional help from the neighborhood around noon on Saturday after having secured emergency energy supply to vital buildings.
“The important thing is that citizens take care of those who are older or who are living alone and report to the local fire brigade houses, when help is needed”, clarified County Commissioner Sebastian Schuster (CDU) following the emergency meeting.
Residents of retirement homes stood in focus during the commissioning and operation of back-up generators.
Additionally, provisional care stations were set up in schools, according to government statements, for all people who could not care for themselves or who required energy dependent medical devices or care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the lid is sold out in Germany.
Can I order with you and pay in euro?
It is about the #PRS_ORG# bedspread in blue-green.
I hope that you also have a beautiful day and that you stay healthy ♡
I am not able to mount the tabletop onto the frame.
We’re talking about a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations of this.
We want one of the tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
instead we got a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t even slide them into each other to make it more compact.
Could you help me with that?
Otherwise I need to send it back because it won’t do the job I need.
I would really appreciate a response
yes that is much simpler!
Then we will do it that way!
will you be sending me the return receipt per mail?
the patch has now been concluded.
I already checked on this before the chat.
Before purchasing, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
So little credit credit, are you shameless?
We don’t agree with this.
Nordic combined: Combined skier Rießle wins
The German Nordic combined skier Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to defeat once again the exceptional skier Jarl Magnus Riiber, who already started with a large lead following the ski jump on the cross country run.
Return with the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back into my account?
Yes, we have done both again and are using Version 4.5...
it could be that you have already heard about the problem many times
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on there.
As soon as I try to open it a note pops up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
The file is most likely corrupted, please submit a report to customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Could you help me further?
Chat connection down so what now?
I also need to work now and again.
In order for the application of paint to be clean and even, you should clear the components of dust, grease and finger prints using soap water and then rinse with clear water and let dry.
It is recommended that you test out 2 to 3 strokes before taking the brush to the model with a new color for the first time.
You can do this on the interior of the component, which will no longer be visible, or on a yogurt container.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
A slight overlapping of the color layers ensures for a even surface later.
Avoid quickly wiping back and forth with the brush.
This is how you get surfaces that appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise shine through.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can result in unattractive metallic streaks when this doesn’t mix with the normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a whole day before assembling them.
Models gain an appearance that is realistic through its decals.
From national emblems on planes to ship names to the trimmings and license plates of automobiles: Decals really put the finishing touches on models.
Apply the decals in the right order whilst the components are still easy to reach.
It is easier - or even just possible - to glue onto a cockpit that is not already attached to the hull.
More important than the correct tools like scissors, tweezers or toothpicks is leaving time for gluing, having patience and using a steady hand.
Cut out each necessary decal one by one and arrange for your use.
Decals are also called “water images”, because you have to first get their backside wet with water until the paper base is darkened by wetness.
Then you push the image a tiny bit away from the paper and place it on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also wetted beforehand).
While you hold the decal to the model with a tool, pull the paper base off to the side.
Be warned: Always check first to make sure the image is sitting correctly before you push it off of the paper completely so that it doesn’t get stuck on your finger, crinkle or just tear.
Soak up surplus water with a household rag.
Caution: Not intended for children under 3-years-old
I can only open the book for a short amount of time, as soon as I look at something else, then I am no longer able to read the book and must sign out and sign back in and load the book up once more and search for my spot in it up to the point I have read to.
I already was in contact with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this via email?
For all 3 packets as well?
The lamp did come in 3 individual packets after all
ok well thanks anyway!
then I will just shop somewhere else as soon as the money is in.
Will I get that back without issue?
Fertility treatment with private insurance / What is an “insurance case”?
Hello everyone,
we have been undergoing fertility treatment for some time but now that it’s time to send invoices to the private health insurance, it’s getting a bit complicated.
How it happened:
We applied in advance for the fertility treatments with the private insurer and got approval for three attempts.
The attempts where not limited in any way (by time restraints, success requirements, etc.).
The first attempt lead directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the private insurer.
Awhile later we attempted to have a second child, and then had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but still haven’t billed these to the private insurance.
We are now reapplying for cost-sharing with the private insurance and were approved for three more attempts.
After a few further attempts (we have tried more often than we applied for, but we only charge the most expensive ones to the insurance, of course) we turned in the invoices to the insurance company and received a nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the private insurance will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The reasoning: After the first pregenancy/birth, the leftover 2 attempts from the first approval were not carried over.
The desire for a second child was then a whole new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, “An insurance case begins with the healing treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.”
The question for the resident experts is:
* Who is right here, the insurance company (only 3 attempts would be reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the private insurance have warned us in the approval that all further attempts would not carry over after a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) was certainly not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion on this.
Thank you for your help in advance!
Could you send me the three variations via email and let me know how I would best reach them
It’s all good.
We won’t order anything from you anymore.
When you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you will see that you obviously lost a good client.
You can forward that on to your manager.
It doesn’t make good business sense.
Yesterday your colleague said to me that the return payment had been arranged and now you say that I first have to send the thing back.
I can’t do anything about the fact that the cabinet was sent to me totally destroyed
Please look at what your colleague had written in the screen shot
It says there loud and clear that a return payment had been arranged and I have still not received a return payment per #PRS_ORG#
You can let your manager know that you’ve now lost two of your best clients.
My boyfriend ordered a variety of furniture for our apartment via his account.
We are not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect appeared after only a few months.
A desk chair has to be able to handle normal usage.
Otherwise it can’t be sold as a desk chair.
In any case, the warranty lasts for 24 months.
No, I’m not able to procure another kind of packaging.
I am going to take apart the cabinet, so that they can be made readily available for the transportation company.
Good day, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional, purchasable stools, however, we can’t seem to find these in your selection.
Could you help out?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films
There is no general definition or an exact budget limit that defines a low-budget film.
Wikipedia says the following:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, like on letterboxd.com, for example.
Do you know any interesting items in this category?
What excites you about it?
And maybe, what do you generally not like?
I am a real good client of yours and have already filled 2 apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to ask about the best price for the gray Odelle leather sofa.
The delivery time was delayed once again, is it a good estimate now?
Thank you
Best regards
Is there a telephone number because a chat that makes you wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
The que hasn’t changed at all unfortunately...I am going to give up now, because it simply just isn’t working here.
Hello
“Half victory” against Belarus carries high cost for EU partners
The EU came in conflict with the Belarussian government according to political expert Raphael Bossong because of the announcement of a “half victory”.
The costs are too high and that means massive loses of rights for migrants and asylum seekers on Belarus’ border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).
The researcher of the foundation Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) in Berlin explained that the EU has not solved this manner in a meaningful way.
This unresolved state - Belarus doesn’t back down, but the EU still feels like the winner - is probably just going to continue.
The living environment of people on the border is not up to the standards of the European Human Rights Convention, determined Bossong.
Obviously there is an “increasing normalization of push-backs” coming through via individual EU regulations.
Because the EU as a whole is not in a decided position towards it, the cost will be fundamental human rights.
This development weakens unity in the union as well.
“They are clearly not able to do anything if a member state gets it into their head to do their own thing,” just like Poland who has not once allowed the EU border protection agency Frontex onto their border.
Therefore the EU is paying a further price for their policies on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A clear position on asylum policies is made difficult by the fact that the slogan “border protection, border protection, border protection” is getting louder.
A renewed attempt to cross over the border
According to Polish border police migrants have attempted once again to cross the border from Belarus into Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a representative of the department said on Sunday.
The migrants reportedly threw stones at the Polish officials before being captured near Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a solider was hit in the face and had to be cared for by a military doctor.
Border police registered a total of 52 attempted border crossers within 24 hours.
On Friday night a group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border fortifications.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border into the EU through Belarus in the past months.
The EU accuses leader Alexander Lukaschenko of having enticed them to come for the purpose of increasing immigration into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have blocked press reports concerning that section of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and put pressure on aviation firms who were bringing in migrants and refugees.
That is why EU commissioners are traveling to these countries of origin to prevent departures from there.
The most successful element of the EU reaction was putting pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
“Because the EU threw their market power onto the scale and put their determination to test and fought hard and operated extraterritorial sanctions”.
Minsk also has to take into account the cost of domestic politics.
The Belarussian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is boycotting the contested Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen broke the rules twice while the race was underway according to a statement from Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes protested following the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The “Silver Arrow” suspects two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The claim refers to the apparent violation from Max Verstappen of Red Bull in the last safety car phase as he passed someone in violation of the rules.
A second claim was laid against the scoring after the race.
According to Mercedes, protocol was not regularly followed.
Verstappen was still able to pass over Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes in the last round and dashed to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred right after the end of a safety car round, in which the Dutchman passed the car driving in front of him.
I’ll check that.
I will speak to the bank and get back to you
thank you for your support
Free access for members: Europa Park is putting on a SC Freiburg Fan Day
The namesake of the Europa Park stadium of the Freiburg sport club Europa Park invited SC Freiburg to a fan day.
As the park announced, members and long-term card holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the Fan Association are allowed to visit Europa Park on that day for free.
Additionally there are vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars are also going to be lit in the red and white of the jerseys on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons are going to provide the perfect atmosphere,” according to the park.
The cooperation between the national league and the amusement park, which stands 40 kilometers north of Freiburg in Rust, has been going on since the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day in Europa Park demonstrated once again how good this partnership is.
Seeing beaming fans, who are having fun together on a roller coaster, confirms this,” said Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original €1699?

Judith Hermann reads from her novel, “Daheim”
As part of the reading series “LiteraTour Nord”, the author Judith Hermann read from her newest novel “Daheim” to a sold-out Blue Note on Friday as well as serving as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and gently overhears the sound of night from her front door.
I sent out the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I have not received a confirmation email or anything like that.
My question reads, has my request been received.
Not everyone has time for your stupid chat and your phony cheap-ware from China.
Your mistake for you to rectify and not push onto our budget.
Contact Ms #NAME#.
I cannot be chatting with you everyday
We talked yesterday and agreed that I, or rather Ms. #NAME#, received an email with 60 euros of store credit, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# night stand and a return receipt.
This email has not arrived yet.
The packet would still like to be brought to #PRS_ORG#.
Please contact me
Kind regards

Sorry, just because he says he isn’t an antisemite doesn’t mean that he isn’t one.
That is like when a member of the AFD say they have nothing against foreigners.
I wouldn’t let either of them off so easy.
The thing is, Kollegah is always reproducing whatever antisemitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just give it up entirely.
Yeah, wow, then maybe you shouldn’t be taken seriously just like Kollegah.
Who fundamentally questions the existence of evolution is entirely lost.
In my opinion, God just got the whole thing running.
But as soon as you’re a creationist, then you have to start believing that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just pushing nonsense.
And then you become an enemy of science and shouldn’t be taken seriously just like Kollegah
In order to achieve an optimal visual field, the magnifying glass should be as close to the eye as possible.
The special aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass up to the peripheral zone practically without contamination or color errors.
Magnifying glasses are often designated by their magnifying specifications.
These specifications are only valid, however, for exactly defined circumstances which very rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally we ask you to pay attention to the “Technical Data” table in the notes (see the operating manual in the delivery package).
Light reflections appear on the lens’ surface of all optical equipment, even folding magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating can significantly reduce these reflections.
By adhering to these optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass right up to the eye - the lens surface reflections are much less noticeable.
Further tips can be found in the included operating manual (available in both German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz are searching for Christmas trees
The agriculturalist Frank Diers has already experienced so many strange situations while selling fir trees.
Once a man even drove back home without his partner because they could not come to a decision together.
Every year he plants about 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has experienced any number of curious situations while at this work.
It makes the time leading up to Christmas a bit more jolly, he says.
And what about the store credit??
Otherwise you’ve lost a client?!
In any case, I received a defective delivery but still payed the full price.
Then, I will just have to rate you all accordingly!
We don’t have to carry out any discussions here about the better dish, but there are certainly similarities between them.
They are both made with meat that has been grilled on a rotating skewer.
And that is where they both get their name.
An equivalent in English would be something like “rotary”, which doesn’t really sound delicious to me.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo Dlan/Magic
We got a new fiber optic cable connected to the house a few weeks ago.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable WiFi connection.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out a smooth 50 Mbit with just a few exceptions.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and this also comes to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
Having said this, the full 500 is not received by the other DLan module, which is sending out the WiFi, but rather the more I move away from the module within the house, the less it receives (using an outlet, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
That means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the second floor than it was before (\~45 Mbit).
I ordered a new Devolo Magic set as well, which is supposed to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but it still lead to similar, significant losses.
Can someone please explain to me how so much internet speed is “going lost” through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time consuming to also lay LAN cables all over the house.
I am really at a loss here, which is why I have created an extra account here.
That is why I would be so happy about getting an answer.
When the time comes to change your checking account
Whoever thought that it was all peace and quiet for checking accounts must now feel like a fool.
While many banks spent autumn getting customers to confirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are falling further as well.
For example, Deutsche Bank has seemed generous in comparison with its 100,000 euro limit.
Now they have halved the tax allowance and even quartered the daily allowance.
As a first step, the limits for children in the partner group Postbank were sunk to 50,000 euro for checking and investment accounts and 25,000 euro for daily allowance accounts.
In the meantime, however, these low tax allowances now apply to the whole of Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And this is not just for new contracts, but also for “newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers”.
Commerzbank had already sunk to a limit of 50,000 euro, which still applies - the same can be said of ING Germany.
Direktbank, DKB, a beloved option for cost-conscious customers, lowered its tax allowance in two steps, first to 50,000 euro and now to 25,000 euro.
Still: In the meantime, more than 100 banks now have a tax allowance of 25,000 euro or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda Bank Berlin has also come to 25,000 euro: However, a legal battle is still taking place with consumer groups, who have already claimed their rights against these changes in the first instance in front of a Berlin regional court.
It is already being discussed at the banks whether the institutions should have provisions in place just in case the high courts declare negative interest to be impermissible and many millions need to be paid back to bank accounts.
A table top for 8 people was delivered instead of one for 6.
The frame is still for 6 people though.
Jennifer Aniston engages a whole beauty army
She is now officially on the top of Hollywood.
However, her life has been a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was selected as the most influential woman of the year by the American magazine “The Hollywood Reporter”.
This acknowledgment is first and foremost the result of much discipline and hard word for her, who made headlines again following her 2021 “Friends” reunion and the extension of her series, “The Morning Show”.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are taking care of her look.
In any case, she still allows herself a chip a day, according to Aniston (yes, that’s right, a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
It is a wonder that the hearts of her fans, male and female, are still beating so hard for her.
Maybe because she has always had bad luck, but still continued to search for that true love.
And crossed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she had always been asked when she was going to become a mother.
That caused her pain.
The people who ask this have no idea what is going on with me personally, that is, medically, and why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
There remains the hope that success and fame will bring happiness.
An unworthy end to a carrier: Räikkönen needs to give up
Kimi Räikkönens departure from Formula 1 went by quieter as was expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
Following a driving error and some light praise from a group of fans, Räikkönen needed to park his Alfa Romeo after less than a half of the race distance during the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the “Iceman” ended his carrier in the hall of motorsport kings.
His wife and two children were also travelling in the United Arab Emirates as part of his departure.
Räikkönen’s greatest victory was his win at the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won the Grand Prix 21 times, he launched from the pole 18 times and came onto the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte in a two-man bobsled - Sports
The bobsled driver’s goal is to beat the record of the Norwegian biathlons Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 wins.
“I ran the numbers, I need to bring in nine-and-a-half victories per season, then it’d be doable by Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who was able to land two victories in two days during the races in Winterberg.
He first fought off the attacks of Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, jumping from third to the top.
Then he changed something on the material settings and managed a great leap forward of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
Along with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he pulled himself ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took on a great risk today and we were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd win in the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth after coming in second before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth place after landing in fourth in the first run.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would also do that,” Lochner said.
Nolte with win at home - Podium for Jamanka
On the women’s side of things, Laura Nolte landed her third victory in the two-person sled on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the single bob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-person bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place to Germany’s quickest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt.
She managed the first podium spot this winter along with her Olympic qualifications.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to stand first place on the podium in the World Cup, I am super happy, that Mariama took me along with.
I am overjoyed with the development.
There is still a lot of potential when starting, the starting times today were only okay,” said Burghardt and emphasized: “It is not just about the push start, but involves a lot of things related to that”.
Jamanka was a little frustrated with the not totally perfect run, but admitted: “It’s a step in the right direction”.
i already had the lid in the shopping cart and could buy them now!!!
What should I do?
But I haven’t even received it and was thus unable to figure it out, which is why I ended up asking about it.
I had bigger problems las year because of Corona and didn’t have any time for it.
And now the expiration seems to have run out, which really makes me mad.
Take a look at the chat, it’s about the Asare bench.
I would like to give it back and then order it once again since it has just gone down in price :)
Why is the delivery only to be sent out on 03/16?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, it is only when I click on it does an extra window come up with the notice
It was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is it a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered package.
But we would still like the cabinet model in spite of this, just a new undamaged one
And not just cancel the whole order.
Only today, only this week left, only up until XY...
Dear gals, girls and women,
I have something which I would just like to write and maybe it is also this way for someone else out there...
I am 24-years-old, have PTSD, am a full-time student and a dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn’t cry or go to kindergarten is it for all intents and purposes my child.
My boyfriend (6 years together) is sick and got second degree burns on Monday and has been depressed for years (but he is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see him and touch him, we cuddled a lot and it was very nice.
I helped him to shower (because his hand is in bandages from the burn).
On top of that he also has a cold and we see each other less (1-2 per week), which really does a number on me given my need for affection and love.
My dog child has stomach pain right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying cuddled up in the blanket and has clamed down a bit now that I have been there for him with the heat lamp and the petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she has now been gone for a month.
Now there is also quite a bit of house work for us, which we are dividing up, of course.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is in a good place right now, I’m halfway through treatment and come to terms with it alright.
Not great, but I am dealing with it and am free of symptoms.
The university is asking a lot right now (by my standards), tomorrow at 3 PM I have a written test that I haven’t prepared for at all and the day after I have an hour of anatomy, for which I do need to prepare a little.
And next week I even have an oral text on that Tuesday, and what comes after that is still there in my calendar and not in my head because there isn’t any room left in there.
Here is my week: Just till the day after tomorrow, and then the weekend.
But then after that the whole thing continues?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And that is how it continues forever.
I believe I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental reference points, because otherwise I won't be able to cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and “chaotic”, but I am not going to manage this any other way...
The same for you?
In all honesty I am eternally grateful that I don’t have to work.
Really, truly grateful, I can’t put that into words.
I don’t know if I would have survived my PTSD any other way.
I believe that is in part due to the mental load on women and that is why I thought to myself that I was sure to find some comrades in suffering here...
I wish all of you a relaxing evening the week is almost over!
I received my order today, but unfortunately it is a totally different color, and besides, the surface is scratched and the table leg has an indent on it.
The first order had a color exactly like the website!
We are very disappointed!!!!
What could you offer me?
If we exchange the table now do we get a totally new color or something like that?
The cancelation email was sent out on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Two times, by the way.
They were never confirmed.
Just something completely new: I determined at school back then that many religion teachers didn’t believe in God and it was just a subject to them like math or geography.
For me that was always strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always just seemed to believe.
What are your thoughts?
Maybe you can also talk about work and school colleagues who have different opinions.
I do understand on a deep level the difference between private life and work life and it makes sense to divide the two.
There is also a teaching plan, etc.
But I would find it quite strange to have a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What would make you want to teach religion, if you don’t believe yourself?
Like to preserve culture?
I hope that the question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or something? Feel free to write in English, I understand that rather well
That is already very long, which means I must desist
It’s alright, thanks.
I’m expecting an expedient response with the latest being the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help find a movie
Dear people,
I am searching for a film from my childhood (I’m 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
There is the present (real world).
Then there is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can’t describe it better anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead there is a young soldier (uniform is similar to the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and a plot is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring this woman into that world in order to be able to live himself.
The portal is also the burial place of the soldier, I believe.
In the end, the two soldiers fight against each other.
In case this rings a bell for any of you, I would appreciate an answer.
Our child would only sleep on its stomach from day 1.
Fast forward: still kicking :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Take care that everything around it is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check a few times, but don’t do constant surveillance.
That will make you go crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
That’s right, ours didn’t have a sleeping bag but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when they sleep.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it lift itself up somewhat from its belly?
Or is it lying with its face directly into the mattress?
You can tell from that if everything is in order.
We have all grown up already and as my husband came into the world, it was very normal that children would sleep on their belly.
Apart from that, we are “Star Customers” with you and have already bought many articles
So why are you asking me for 20 euros?
Hi, I was writing a colleague of yours yesterday, but I haven’t received a response.
It’s about my wardrobe which came yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn’t fit into the wardrobe.
I ask you to get back to me asap.
The wardrobe cannot be used in this state.
In order to say it very clearly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know that not every promise can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just obvious that the politics of this broadcaster has really gone to the dogs in the meantime.
Almost every program is sponsored (ok), but they still go on begging tours at the same time.
It was said that you were an “independent” internet broadcaster.
Arno quote: You don’t want to be “a walking advertisement”.
What are you now?
A 8:15 AM advertisement who attempts to bring their cheap merch to elite fans.
And then we have Marah’s Do’s & Don’ts.
That apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne, of course.
They are still able to insult people, of course.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to burn everything down at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How is anyone impressed by all this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am asking for a return call, because the wooden table was delivered to me defect.
Broken body through an uncareful delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether it’s a comforter for stomach pain or simply for cuddling: My little warm friend has many uses.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home cure for soothing applications of warmth, because the cherry pits absorb warmth very well and then release it in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be warmed up rather easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The smooth cover makes use especially pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure even if it’s not going so well for them.
The cherry pit cushion with cover is a warm application suitable only for the following uses:
Check for atypical smells, mold and burn marks before warming and dispose of it immediately if they are found.
Please take the interior cushion out of the cover before warming it up!
Warm up in the microwave at max. 300 watt for max. 2 minutes (pay attention to the directions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Spread the warmth evenly throughout right after heating by shaking the pillow!
Afterwards put the interior cushion back inside of the cover.
A little bit of wetness can appear on the surface during the first time warming up, however, this will disappear following repeated use.
Please pay attention to the given warming instructions, since longer times or more power can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before you warm up the pillow in the microwave, check to make sure that the heating of seeds is allowed in the user manual of the manufacturer.
As soon as the heated inner cushion is put back inside its cover, please check that the temperature of the cushion is suitable for babies (max. 43°C) using the crook of your arm.
Don’t use the cushion during current or chronic, inflamed or feverish illnesses, circulation issues, fresh hemorrhoids, blood clots and open wounds as well as on people with low pain tolerances.
Please ask a doctor before using during active skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor-related diseases, or in the case of pregnancy.
Should seems open up and spare pits fall out, dispose of the product and immediately make the pits inaccessible to children.
If the product is to be used on children under the age of 1, then the temperature of the child during use should be regularly checked to exclude the possible of overheating!
Report all difficult incidences that arise while using the product to the manufacturer and to the responsible governing body, in whose jurisdiction the user lives.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please read the maintenance symbol on the product!
Darmstadt finished second after the first series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the national soccer league.
While Hannover 96 is working its way out of the gutter.
Ingolstadt’s third coach is still not working for them.
Excitement in Darmstadt following their late victory in the big match, joy in Hannover at their interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut of their new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) is no longer charging through my power supply.
I bought this part new just 5 months ago, which means it should probably still work.
I thought an adaptor was enough for operation anyway.
Error notices, the battery is dead and the laptop is not starting in spite of the connected adaptor.
Because of this, I even removed the battery, but that didn’t help.
Maybe you have an idea?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can’t I just use the laptop with the power cable?
Is something else broken?
Thanks for your help!
I would like the #PRS_ORG# delivery to be carried into the room itself.
How can I arrange this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# stool.
I don’t know how tall the seat is...
Are you often out trekking but still have a lot of equipment?
This isn’t a problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
With 20 liters of load capacity it can envelop larger photo equipment without a problem, which can be stored safely thanks to the upholstered FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other daily necessities you need can be kept well organized and separated from the photography equipment in individual, adjustable interior spaces with practical access points.
The series is presenting itself with a new look following the Version 2 (V2) “update” to the Everyday line.
The sleek, minimalist design already has everything in itself, as the proverb goes - Peak Design developed its own, highly-innovative solutions with the Everyday Backpack series, which reliably protects the interior of the backpack but still allows for access to the photo equipment within a few short seconds.
This functions because of two possibilities: A conventional method via the fold-over cover, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an impressively thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself for messenger bags.
As part of this, a locking, metal hook is located in the locking flap with corresponding anchors on the front of the backpack.
Peak Design also thought of different degrees of “fullness”, which makes it a distinct design: this includes 4 stable anchors, to which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, just use the highest anchor, if it is almost empty, use a lower one.
Locking flaps and hooks are especially magnetic.
That is how the backpack can be reliably closed even without using the hooks.
The second possibility makes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally different from other photographers’ backpacks: There are also zipper openings next to the fold-over cover on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest downside to conventional backpacks with an opening at the top - you don’t have to fumble through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily usefulness of the backpack enormously: This doesn’t just help if you are caring photo equipment, but also for everyday objects, or for use as a travel bag.
Inside of the Everyday Backpack you can customize the individual interior spaces (more on that below) and in so doing store both types of item separately without issue - and have independent access to them through the side openings.
That is also how you can access the backpack out the right side of the body in order to, for example, access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday objects can remain secure in the left half of the backpack without anything coming between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable usability really helps with this.
The outer shell of the backpack is also made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, which can keep the inner contents dry during an autumn trip to Scotland.
Unfortunately I’m still waiting for an email from your support team.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday to confirm the order of the hiring
contact initiation on the side of the moving company in order to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
I have received no messages up to this point.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support worker, none of whom promised more than that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It’s about a return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It remains to be seen when the wardrobe could be delivered again?
Keeping it the way it is isn’t an option for me.
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
I wish you a good evening
Hello, my delivery no. is #NUMBER#; when will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 01/12/21.
A totally different lamp from the one I ordered was delivered
Please call
If you are able to extend the store credit for me, then I will put out a larger order immediately, but in any case I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and have not sent it back.
And the fact that the past year proceeded differently than expected, I wasn’t able to predict it and then didn’t promptly clarify the issue.
But I have taken the damages as the client and I am not going to just accept that.
Rotinger disc brakes are designed to handle dynamic driving, to be reliable and safe while braking and to be really shine under difficult circumstances.

On the basis of the individual, technical designation, a special manufacturing process is created that is directed at balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
Tuned discs, which are manufactured according to this method, ensure a high level of comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of disk cooling, whereby sectioning improves the cleaning of disc brakes and the brake pads.
The aesthetic qualities of our tuned discs emphasize the character of the car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city, in which something unexpected happened in the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern fork of the American river discovered a brilliant nugget in the water.
Even though he attempted to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread very quickly and lead to the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands of people from near and far turned Coloma into one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Ground were staked out, tents were put up, saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their part in the riches of the land.
The motto for many was: “Coloma or Bust”!
In this game, you are a pioneer, who is looking for riches in the West and who wants to make a name for yourself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, roundup horses and build up enterprises.
You will also have the opportunity, to explore the length of nearby rivers and the bordering lands.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order to not go broke like the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneous choose your actions, economize with your resources and setup a board, which “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on this board allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to bend rules in your favor.
With the help of subtle adjustments, you can develop your own individual play style with these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles.
Coloma takes place over the span of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) up until 1850 (the year that California officially received its statehood).
A year in Coloma is made up of five rounds.
During every round, the players will simultaneously select a position on the board in secret where they will carry out their actions.
After this, their choices will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, then it gets a block!
This deactivates one half of the location, which then reduces the number of possible actions there.
The players then take turns performing actions, like, for example, gaining resources, moving wagons, putting up tents, searching rivers, building a bridge, opening a business or positioning gunslingers.
When all actions have been concluded, the pioneers can return.
The advertiser turns at the beginning of each round towards a different location and changes thereby what actions are available.
This goes on until the advertiser has turned around five times, which means they covered every location and the year is over.
There is a stand-off in which the players have to protect Coloma against an ambush by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and they are numerically superior to the bandits, then they get rewarded.
If they fail, then they get less rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends in a third stand-off after which comes the final scoring.
The player with the most victory points wins!
I can take on the delivery type, shipment (game wrapped in foil) up to a size of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
Everything else is DPD insured with package tracking, for the most part (game wrapped in foil, fleece and wrapping paper).
If you are a collector, then I can also send over the box in a box for an additional 2 euro, so that it definitely stays in pristine condition.
“Why Kids are not Tyrants” Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW: psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up today in my Twitter feed and I started watching immediately.
>The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a much-loved guest by talk shows and has held discussions all over Europe.
He launched a serious debate over raising children with his book “Why our Children become Tyrants” (2008).
Past patients, parents and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film can be hard to watch.
I am very grateful that people are now thinking and acting differently than they used to.
Parents and other responsible parties should never, ever struggle for power over the child.
Our goal should be to give our children enough space to develop on their own and to make boundaries for the child as spacious as possible and reasonable for the situation.
Geez, I’m still shaken up about it.
Holetschek: The states are discussing removing the test requirement for thrice immunized people
The states’ health ministers would like to discuss in their next meeting a nationwide elimination of the test requirement for people with three immunizations.
“The states need clarity fast about if and when the test requirement for thrice immunized people can be done away with,” Chairperson of the Health Minister Conference Klaus Holetschek (CSU) told the “Bild am Sonntag”.
The elimination of 2G plus for people with three immunizations is “not only medically advisable but also offers additional incentive to get vaccinated,” said Holetschek.
The Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) added that, “the Health Ministers’ Conference would already like to made a recommendation on this for the upcoming Tuesday”. - afp
Well, I would like to send the lamp back
How do I go about that best?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# is very beautiful, however, I can’t tell how high the seat is.
Could you help me further?
I am not able to carry out any more purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Notice: Oops, an error has occurred.
It works to purchase the #PRS_ORG# via the computer.
My bank details are all up to date.
What could be the problem?
What you are describing is called *Awareness* and refers to the sensory perception under full narcoses.
This occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often it results in the hearing of voices/noises, less common is the appearance of images and the least common is the perception of pains.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations which lead to a high rate of Awareness, which is avoided for the protection of the baby up until the cutting of the umbilical cord.
Preceding episodes of Awareness should be brought up in the consultation prior to the narcosis.
Certain anesthetic procedures like total interveinal anesthesia (TIVA) come along with a slightly higher risk.
**EDIT: Dear reader, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex** doesn’t have any by definition.
I read your comment wrong.
But the chair is broken!
The €20 are not going to help either.
These are the legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that you at least take bake the broken chair.
That is not only your legal responsibility but also standard practice in eCommerce.
Please check once again to see if you could at least take back the broken chair.
We would then just sell the second chair privately.
We will already be losing quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email, which you have not answered yet.
I’ll ask again.
In the order and on the receipt it said that the article would be delivered into a room of my choice.
The delivery service is #NAME#.
I am now calling them.
I was told that they deliver just to the building’s entrance because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is this true?
If so, then I need to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who could carry heavy furniture up to the second floor for me.
will I not be called?
I submitted a query
The theater historian Günther Rühle (97) is dead
He distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
The new book was still laying on the table, fresh from the printers: “An Old Man Grows Older”.
The shocking diary of a slow departure from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle had worked on up until April 2021.
And in the middle of the editing process the message was received that the author had died.
The last sentence of the book reads: “I would like to express how grateful I am to be alive.”
There are many types of pallets.
One of the most common types are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mostly as load carriers in European regions.
They are certified by the European Pallets Association EPAL
According to data from Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in 2020.
The value of this production was about 79 million euro.
It was not mentioned how many pallets are imported to Austria every year

Roulade Tips & Tricks
A few weeks ago, I received a lot of great tips here for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and tender!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and I would like to make roulades for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow, I will start a beef stock for this.
Do any of you have additional tips for me?
Notice: I don’t have an oven, just a large pot.
How’s it going now?
What is going on with the books, or rather, how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not very good, but I can manage
It concerns the return payment of €#NUMBER#
I was told through email on the 18/01 that the return payment had been carried out successfully.
However, the money has still not been deposited on my end.
Could you please check this.
Where is there still Christmas roast in and around Lübeck
For many people, duck or goose are as important to the Christmas holidays as a Christmas tree or presents.
You have not found any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We recommend places where you can still get Christmas roast in and around Lübeck.
The “drive” of a tube amplifier contributes considerably to the warmth and the fat tone of the guitar amplifier.
These aspects are implemented perfectly by the Valve reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME knobs, you can adjust desired levels on the one hand and the distortion of the sound on the other hand.
Furthermore, the amplifier of the VT+ series offers a unique POWER LEVEL knob with which you can reduce the sound level without changing the “gain” and the distortion at all.
As mentioned above, the POWER LEVEL knob can even be used for power reserve when it gets outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL knob, the whole potential of the VT+ series is usable in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal that is sent through here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get a eminently “acoustic” sound impression even when using headphones or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can even be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam along to your favorite hits.
A tuner function is also on board, which means you don’t need a separate tuning device.
Whoever wants to buy a VFS5 footswitch, can also conveniently call up sounds with their foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is truly a necessity for use onstage.
VOX is taking a further step into the future with their new powerhouses!
Did this look like this for others.
Is there a way to send back the lamp?
Because it hangs to low for a dinning table?
That is why I would be happy to send it back.
Could you help me with that?
And the commode?
Are we going to get an update in the following weeks about an exact delivery time?
Hello, have you already sat down on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
In case that doesn’t work, I would also be content with a rebate or store credit.
If need be I can find someone to pick-up the furniture.
Over 1,000 Euro for goods that I don’t need is really rather much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to have known, if the screws were supposed to be part of the delivery.
I would really like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) onto the intended hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait time really wasn’t worth it
Do you not prioritize premium customers?
Iran sees advances in negotiations concerning the nuclear deal
Progress was made according to Iranian sources during negotiations over a revival of the international atomic agreement.
“Both sides are really close to coming to an agreement concerning different themes, which should be standing on the daily agenda,” said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a “positive and important development,” because at the beginning there was no kind of agreement on the topics to be discussed.
The agreement should inhibit Iran from the development of nuclear weapons.
The Vienna discussions on the revival of the agreement were put in motion again on Thursday after a short one week break.
Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia were all at the table for the discussions.
A US delegation was also on location in Vienna, but they were only indirectly taking part in the negotiations.
Thüringen has overtaken Saxony - the free state now has the highest rate of Corona infection
Thüringen replaced Saxony and currently holds the highest incidence rate in the country.
This single federal state now has a value above the 1,000 mark.
Thüringen was the single state on Sunday that was over the 1000 mark for Corona infections.
The Robert Koch Institute released the figure of 1,025 new infections per 100,000 residents over the last seven days.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence rate in the whole country, the figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
The incidence rate had sunken somewhat in Thüringen on Friday and Saturday, however it still lay above the 1,000 line.
2,242 new infections of the Sars CoV2 Virus and 16 infection-related deaths were reported in Thüringen within a single day.
200 serious Covid 19 cases were treated in intensive care facilities in hospitals on Sunday.
There may have also have been delayed reporting on the weekend.
Additionally, the health departments have been overburdened for weeks already and can hardly deal with the new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery took place only at the beginning of March, it might be possible up till that point.
I need to print this off, tape it onto the package and drop it off with the post, is that it?
I don’t need to click on anything or fill anything else out?
That is exactly what I would like to avoid; that is why I am writing you.
I would like a refund equaling the original cost.
A 8 euro return delivery fee is an insult in my eyes.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag, greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE from the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is this post about?
If you look at the MBundestag’s actions over the past few months you can really see that: It’s not really there.
We have come into winter hibernation and extended the summer slump a few months.
#What is the problem?
And what was it really about?
For the most part that can hang in connection with feelings of discontent, like how somethings here expired and how we are in general.
The last days have contributed to the impression that a lot of people here really are interested in MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around MBundestag was asked, who would like to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who was made aware of this project in the last few days and who found a pile of shards, putting it simply.
After some push and pull, many people in the community gathered together with a desire to bring this project back to life.
Having said this, I would like to expressly call upon everyone to take part once again; it is the only way this project can survive into the future.
For this purpose, we created a discussion platform in the forum of a Discord server, in which we can all exchange opinions with each other as well as working out concrete things.
The server can be entered with the following link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing ordinances must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside in the future?
* How should new members be enlisted?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten a few things, which is not a bad thing, that is why we have Discord after all.
If you would like to, and have the time, then come onto Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I also ordered a lamp shade with you, which is still being delivered.
Now I can see, that the item is too big/bulky and not made for my tastes.
That is why I ordered another draping piece.
I put it together and that is when I noticed this - grasping the white foam.
I’m real sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will get a full refund.
This is also rather sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# available in larger sizes, 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to guarantee that the damaged cabinet can be picked-up soon.
I’m asking you to please arrange that asap.
I don’t have suitable packaging material for this, but I’ll take the cabinet apart as much as I can before the pick-up - you and #PRS_ORG# need to figure out how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me via telephone if they want to set up a pick-up time.
Are there directions for assembly?
How long would I have to take care of that, or rather, to decide on the return?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a discussion with a colleague who I really like.
She lived as a vegetarian for quite a while and even now only very rarely eats meat.
I was also vegetarian for a few years myself.
On the question of whether I always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned middle step, I answered quickly, honestly and without much thought.
The reason: I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare by being a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood, that I was still supporting cruelty to animals.
Which is why I decided to become vegan.
That is when I had the impression that I caused her displeasure, she defended vegetarianism and added that she knows where her meat comes from and as a vegetarian you do reduce the pain of animals.
Now I am wondering if my answer was too “clumsy”?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that I am quickly put into a corner as a vegan person and that conflicts appear even if you wouldn’t have wanted it that way.
Signing off, a harmony loving vegan (;
This certainly is not an exception according to Section 312d of the BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from legal obligations when distance selling.
I was not on the referenced date when #PRS_ORG# picked up at the pickup site.
Because I was gone at a funeral, this was not able to happen.
Could you please send me an alternative pick-up date.
I am continuously available again to meet after 01.02#NUMBER#.
The Lahnsteiner weir is equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the district
At the Lahnsteiner Town Hall, the Interior Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Roger Lewentz recently handed over to the Mayor Peter Labonte a grant declaration to the amount of 45,000 euro towards the new equipment vehicle for water rescue for the volunteer firefighters in Lahnstein.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, lay at about 135,000 euro.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am happy that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us with this,” said Lahnstein’s Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the diving squad of Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rheinland Palatine.
They are fulfilling water and ice rescue missions as well as providing technical assistance both above and under water.
They have been dealing with more and more operations in Lahnstein: The boom in floating hotels on the Rhein and Mosel as well as the always increasing use of the Lahn as a river for free-time enjoyment has contributed to this.
I bought a book, which I could only read up to 10% of and then the problems started.
I am not allowed to open the book.
Following your recommendation, I synchronized, removed and downloaded the app once more but NOTHING worked.
I am somewhat frustrated, because the whole ordeal cost me a lot of time so I’m hoping for assistance.
Alright, that works.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection from #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I set a date during the order process?
The above values are determined according to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard in the Fenix laboratory at 21°C ± 3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the installed battery 275 mAh LiPo battery.
The values can deviate depending on age, environment and the flashlight used.
*: The burning time at the bright level includes burning time with reduced brightness due to overheat protection.
2) Retailers are responsible for customers.
Customers should contact the retailers or distributors through which they bought the Fenix lights for the purpose of warranty support with the ‘warranty card’ from Fenixlight Limited along with either the retail invoice or a receipt.
Fenix will provide our authorized retailors with the technology and parts that are necessary for the maintenance of our lights.
1) 15-day free replacement: Fenix replaces a new product within the first 15 days after purchase as a result of manufacturing errors if problems appear during normal use.
We will replace it with the same model.
If the model has been discontinued, customers will receive a product from a similar or better model.
2) Free repair for 5 years: Fenix offers free repair for lamps within 5 years of the date of purchase, if a problem arises during normal use.
Different warranty times for different products:
With the exception of the products and accessories introduced above, other products or free offers from Fenix are not covered by this product warranty.
3) Limited lifelong warranty: We still provide lifelong repair for lamps, which have gone past the warranty period for repairs, but just ask for a fee for the parts.
The retailors inform customers about the costs of the parts before repairing.
4) Warranty certificate: Customers request customer service from Fenix retailors by providing a filled-out Fenix warranty card, purchase invoice or receipt.
The distributor should provide customer service and Fenix will support these services.
5) The free warranty does not cover damages or failures, which are the result of:
any defects or damages, which are caused by unreasonable conditions, including but not limited to conditions, which do not correspond to the instructions in the product specification.
For example, the product specification explains that the sealed head may not be disassembled because this damages the flashlight and can make the warranty invalid.
Any defects or damages, which are the result of other behaviors, cannot reasonably be checked by Fenix.
6) In order for a warranty claim to be accepted, please contact our warranty department with the following details: Name, type/model of the warranty object, serial number.
Thank you first of all for bringing this all up here, for my part I spent a decade in public service doing a similar job, we were even weapon carriers with executive power, I don’t have to go any more in depth than that!
I always find the question about right or left to be solved rather easily.
As a general rule, you should say that public servants should rather come somewhere in the spectrum from liberals to conservatives and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course people who wear uniforms and carry weapons are magically pulled right of conservative should also be clear to everyone, that these people are of course having issues coming to terms with reality, that is clear to see, because apart from your average whites you also have many people in the meantime coming with immigrant background of course, women and also homosexuals (and I don’t now mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gays, because these are becoming rarer in the executive branch, if they are there at all, but normal men and women who you don’t even notice it when you talk to them) and even for these people I can and must just let go, because in doubt they will save your life or go out on a limb for you.
But these periphery groups also represent a rather conservative position, even if it sounds strange at first, in my opinion, they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if these politics supposedly stand up for them or think they have to do right by them, while they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right: because police and armed forces are just a cross section of society, this means that you will find extreme right people there, but that these people are permitted to openly speak their minds in that space or even form whatever plans to endanger society is totally exaggerated and really bothers me.
Of course it happens that police and soldiers who were often out of the country on deployment often begin to generalize because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are contrary to political correctness.
It also happens that they sometimes find real kindred spirits and engage in excited exchanges of thoughts.
Nevertheless, this sort of thing should be pushed against and all of it should be counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so involved internationally, which is a good thing in my opinion, which is why we can’t allow for real racists and Nazis to be among our ranks!
Yeah, that’s what I don’t get, I also ordered the other goods from the German site.
Why should they be coming from England?
When I ordered, they weren’t sold out.
I ordered as far back as November.
But it had been confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It’s still about my order that couldn’t be delivered.
I was chatting using the name #NAME#.
On the other hand, one should be able to deliver the  #PRS_ORG# goods for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany under the table, otherwise is there somewhere these goods could be picked up in Germany.
I only view you as my partner company.
but up on the border of the wooden part there are two deep notches, which have been filled in with some yellow substance
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
More tidy with a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with an issue for quite some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (freelancer, not a lot of free time), but somehow this whole time I have found it more difficult than it should be to keep a clean and tidy home on some kind of regular basis.
There are always times when things are just lying around, and then at some point it starts to bother me and I make it all tidy and clean.
But it is very rarely the case that “someone comes to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) not much better, it does bother me sometimes but most of the time house chores lose in favor of work and laziness.
The kitchen is the most regularly clean space because we really like to cook.
Now my question: did you manage to become more tidy with a child?
We still don’t have any but we are working on it and these questions has been bugging me for some time.
Because at the moment there is no incentive for me, it just doesn’t really bother me as long as no one comes to visit or, for example, as long as there are clean clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have more incentive with a child or do you still stay so sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and high quality as well as anatomically preformed cuts offer a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and allow for practically uninhibited freedom of movement.
Pre-formation with special, additional imprinting on the joins for improved freedom of movement (on the crook of arm and knee)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System was doubled in comparison to Flex System 2, in order to increase comfort once again.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce rubbing (armpits, crook of arm and knee)
High quality pre-formation in the lower back area and in the crouch ensure for a perfect, snug fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel around the vertebrae of the back increases flexibility along the back zipper and improve comfort thereby, especially when bending over or when mounting and applying gear to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is found around the shoulders and on the back, guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-resistant material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to an especially sensitive part of the body.
Seamless, thin (less than 2 mm) seal on the face and the hood increases comfort, water resistance and durability (separate hood)
Soft areas in the collar improve the seal with a minutely sensitive width adjustment via a flexible, gentle Velcro fastener, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams
Dual cuffs with zipper on the arm and foot joints connect an invincible inner zipper with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° indentation on the closing point of the inner cuff for heightened elasticity and resistance when putting on.
A longer zipper at the neck with an elastic support for an anatomical cut with heightened comfort for overalls without hood
Longer G Lock P back zipper (overalls without hood) with metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcement on all ends of the zippers in order to inhibit a rip in the case even if too much strength is used.
Neoprene panels evenly glued with outer and inner overlapping
Edges of the outer zipper hemmed for greater durability
Edges of the inner zipper grooved for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer to its place especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all suitable armband computers)
A carrier in social work - as someone with an avoidant personality disorder?
I have been trained in the field of software development and have been done with my training for about a year.
The problem is that I now notice more and more that this isn’t really the carrier for me, which is why for a long time I have been contemplating starting new again and studying social work.
The problem is that I have an avoidant (or anxiously insecure) personality disorder (AvPD).
That means in general terms that I have no feeling of personal value and am really shy because of it.
I have no problem speaking to people in an objective, factual manner but it is really hard for me to carry out relaxed conversations and I have been told on many occasions that I seem unapproachable (although I do think this has gotten better in the meantime).
Can a person like me be a social worker?
I don’t want to work out in the streets or at teenager meet-ups, but rather something like addiction consultation or family support.
However, I am not sure if the actual everyday work rhythm is really like how I picture it and it is really hard to find anything about this on the internet.
AvPD is already causing problems at my workplace (for me, emotionally), because I put myself down every time there is something to criticize about my code (“messed up something simple again so soon”) and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help (“I should really know how this works by now”/”I am stopping him from working with my dumb questions”/”They must think I’m really incapable,” etc).
I would probably have problems with any carrier but I didn’t want it to go unmentioned.
So you have already received the sofa?
We never got a confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do you mean with please return!
When I have downloaded a book from #PRS_ORG#, the report came in that your #PRS_ORG# didn’t authorize this book
any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me whether or not I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein which is absorbed through the feed is digested by the bird into protein blocks (amino acids) in the gastrointestinal tract; it then uses these to build proteins suited for its own body, which are necessary for coat formation.
The coat formation for birds while nestling and molting are especially complex processes and connected to an especially high level of stress for the whole organism of the animal.
Please remember that NEKTON Bio is not to be used while breeding, because it can result in disruptions in blood circulation.
Following the curative administration of NEKTON Bio, a return to daily vitamin intake with NEKTON S (multi-vitamin compound) and NEKTON MSA (mineral compound) is recommended.

It is recommended that you only prepare as much drinking water/soft feed as required to meet the animals daily needs and that water/feed is switched out daily.
A level spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In cases of extreme damage to the plumage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given to start with until the coat visibly starts to grow again.
After which the normal dosage is enough to fully realize coat formation.
Storage: Store NEKTON Bio in a dry place, out of the way of direct sunlight, at a temperature between 15-25°C.
I’m sorry but the chair was being sold as a office chair.
How can a desk chair go broke after 9 months?
The warranty claim in Germany is 24 months.
This is really a bad service.
Hello, I sent out an email on Monday in order to let you know, that my order came damaged and I attached photos.
Have you seen the email?
Statement from a community colleague in contrast to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following issue.
A walnut tree is planned to be cut down on our land.
A felling application has been sent to the community.
A colleague wrote to me that the felling of fruit trees, which then would include the walnut tree, is not part of the bylaws.
Walnut trees are not specifically listed in the bylaws, however.
Can I still trust the statement of my colleague or not?
On the one hand, I really must rely on the opinion of an expert.
On the other hand, the bylaws are pretty clear.
Thank you for your answer
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for that.
I never received a message
Whatever, now I still have a sofa without any use for it.
Could you at least send me a rebate or store credit?
Which would cost more?
Yes, I think so, but the question is, whether I can pay in euro and have the lid delivered to me in Germany
Can you look into that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
A serious traffic accident has just occurred on the St 2179 between the junctions Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press report has just reported (2:03 PM), a car passed through into incoming traffic.
There are injuries.
Right, I get it.
Great, well thanks again that it went so smoothly!
Advice and ideas for a further carrier
First of all, happy Christmas to all of you!
Unfortunately my Christmas was only OK because my poor brain overthinks everything that you can overthink.
Before I let it all out here, I’ll say in brief: I need advice and it would be best coming from people who are somehow familiar with my situation - that is, from you.
I have ended up rather surprisingly as a student teacher.
Originally I had studied something else and even worked in the field (in order to remain somewhat anonymous I am not going to say anymore here).
The whole thing was just too boring for me and I looked for alternatives which would have been more fun for me.
Somehow I ended up going into teaching and was sure that this was it, even if the environment was much less flexible than in my previous job, I didn’t really care.
I am now for the third time like “I’ll search for other job vacancies”.
And it has just been a half of a year.
The times before I always decided to continue and to just bring the student teaching to an end, after that I can always change my mind.
But now I am totally dead.
I have had so little free time in the last months, and I am so tired of it.
It is the break, but even now there is still a mountain of work waiting for me.
I always thought before the student teaching that I was stress resistant, but back then my weekends were my weekends and after work was after work.
I really had freedom.
And the stress of work didn’t really matter in that moment.
Now even vacation with my family is stressful.
And there are these stubborn structures, which annoy me all the more.
In general, it is fun and from an outside perspective the student teaching is going well as far as feedback goes.
But I am really just spent and ask myself, how much stress my body can really handle before it just gives up entirely - if it has not done that already.
I ask myself, if I could have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read many of the posts from you all - or if I would be better off just going back to my old industry, where I was valued more, could take more free time when I needed it, and although the work was rather boring, it was paid well in return for this and really worked together towards something in a team and not a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
That is when I ask myself, if I would not just come back to the same place after a year and be as unsatisfied as I am now.
You all must have noticed that it is somehow confusing, but maybe you have an outsider’s advice or ideas of how I could get out of this situation, with which I am totally done and which makes me practically brake out in tears when I think about it for a moment.
Making decisions is something that I am not ready for emotionally, which is probably not leading to anything good.
But maybe your perspectives could help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that would be a start.
Thank you for reading and please excuse the complaining tone.
I hope that my situation has become somewhat clearer at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand-new modeling engine, which is the absolute state-of-the-art in the field of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which utilizes an analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifier puts forth an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include the multi-leveled Valvetronix tube amplifiers, of course.
This deals with real analogue circuits, because these simply are better than any simulation at obtaining the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifier offers a closed casing and bass reflex system, from which natural resonances just burst out.
With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on a virtual plane until the amp and the effects sound just like you have always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is above all thanks to the VOX valve reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Naturally, it has been refined ever since then in order to handle new sound requirements, which in 2010 lead to a renewed power boost to the VOX Valvetronix series with more dynamics as well as numerous, decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has additionally been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they need here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamics of a tube amp: They want a fat sound, a nuanced playback of playing dynamics and chord strokes, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage above all else determines the tube character of an amplifier and they developed the VOX Valve reactor technology on the basis of this discovery.
The Valve reactor circuit of any VT+ amplifier equipped with a 12AX7 tube produces the character, the subtle nuances and the sound shape of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: In spite of Wagner’s 20 points: Magics loose to the Clippers
The series of losses continues for the NBA’s Orlando Magic.
Although the Wagner brothers deserve credit, it was not enough to bring victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
In spite of 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday to the Los Angeles Clippers 104-106.
Apart from that, the large main compartment is also adjustable: it can really match the needs of your photo equipment with three individual moveable and foldable Velcro-fastened parts, which make it suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras in all sizes to full-sized, mirror reflex cameras.
What will fit into the backpack is of course dependent on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible option would be the DSLFR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras and different models of the Sony AY7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave even more room for lenses.
Apart from that, you can also store a number of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for equipment and for other, non-camera related things.
Drone pilots are also making a good choice with the 20 L Everyday Backpack, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
A volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flow on the Canary island has caused massive damage.
Is there an end in sight?
Lasting 85 days so far, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest eruption in recorded history on the Spanish Canary island.
Previously the longest eruption of the Tehuya volcano on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa was in 1585 and lasted 84 days.
There is no reliable data on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja had even started to lessen in past days, but volcanologists do not dare to give a prediction on when it could end.
The indicators are pointing to a slow down.
The best news is that it is stable,” the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, said to the public TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages are now in the millions
In the just about three months since the beginning of the eruption, the over 1000°C lava has destroyed 2,900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE reports.
Almost 1,200 hector were covered by the meter-thick layer of lava.
That is about 1,700 football fields.
Almost 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at about 900 million euro.
Frozen lava has resulted in two new headlands off the coast with a total size of about 50 hector.
The islands immensely important banana plantations were the most hard hit, from which about half of the 85,000 residents live, directly or indirectly, and which were already in crises mode before the volcanic eruption.
225 hector of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas were severely effected, according to the newspaper “El País”.
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is just in front of the door and the holy festival will certainly be enjoyed by children the most.
The many bright presents under the Christmas tree have something tempting about them as they combine with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of a few traditional occasions which still bind together our increasingly split society.
That is why it is so important that the Christmas tradition of gift giving is done consciously, so that the gesture of giving, which has been called a “social contract of primitive people” by the French Sociologist and Ethnologist Marcel Mauss, which offers an escape from routine that can then be filled with new life by the context around these traditions.
Just as Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking it was the protestants who were the first to connect the Christmas days closely with gift giving.
Previously, gifts had been exchanged in many different ways on Saint Nicholas Day.
The background behind this tradition, which is still alive today, is that the bishop of Myra, Saint Nicholas, secretly threw money into the windows of three women one night to save them from living in sin anymore.
This unconventional manner of gift giving preceded the beloved practice in Germany of filling children’s shoes with presents.
Protestants took offense at this tradition because they rejected middlemen between God and man as "veneration of saints."
In this manner, they provide resistance to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby founded a new line of tradition.
The focus on gift giving was then pushed onto Christmas Eve.
Because most Protestants no longer view such niche questions so literally, only a few are still annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas - like the Martin custom with its singing and parade - is still an integral part of the time leading up to Christmas.
Today you will find everything the heart desires stuffed into boots in front of the bedroom door and everything from socks to luxury watches under the Christmas tree.
Diversity of traditions in Christian lands
Sources point to traditions of gift giving going as far back as the 13th century for Saint Nicholas Day.
Following the reformation, the tradition of gift giving was pushed onto Christmas Eve.
All over Christendom there is a happy mix-up when it comes to the question of when the children are brought presents.
In Germany, religion is decisive on Christmas Eve regarding the question of Christ Child or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas that has been given his own qualities with the passage of time.
This includes his white bushy beard, for example, which really has little in common with the much more strict Assyrian beard of the historic figure, or his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, or his preference for using the chimney to enter homes.
Holy Nicholas remains the central Christmas figure in the Netherlands.
In Spain it is the three wise men that bring presents, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who supposedly lead the way to Baby Jesus.
Sometimes in Scandinavia the presents are brought by creatures from fables, while in Russia, Father Frost has gained in popularity.
It is not reindeers, but rather a triumvirate of three horses that pull his sled.
The Christ Child is responsible for the giving of presents in the Czech Republic, the mother country of the reformation following the Hussite Wars.
I have been getting this error report for the last 3 weeks every time that I try to download the book, this although my bank and contact details are all up-to-date:
Please help in clearing up this error, because I
would in that case like to buy another e-Book #PRS_ORG#.
I requested a return ticket for my order #NUMBER# both last week and this morning.
I was told that one had been sent to me.
Because I haven’t received anything (not even in the spam folder), I wanted to ask once more, how long this normally takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot and kill a suspected bank robber near the Königspalast
Near the Kensington Palace in London a man with a gun was shot to death by police on Saturday.
The police released as statement saying that callers had reported a man with a gun went into a bank and the office of a printers.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officials not long after.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
Police are not assuming it to be a terrorist attack.
Multiple embassies are located near Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Additional members of the royal family also live there.
Which is that?

The decorative lights mix harmoniously into each flower bed, gardening plot or rock garden.
The lights are easy to setup and can be anchored into the ground with 2 stakes.
Integrated and high-performance 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the integrated battery.
Battery life, max. 10h.
- The robust plastic design can be deployed in outdoor areas all year.
According to Hollywood, It is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow from within.
In contrast, our “Smart Stone” is totally harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light beams in a fascinating way - available in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The smooth, amorphous design is an intentional choice: This modern illuminating object appears to be your average pebble during the day.
Its organic roundness can fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the patio, in the lawn or in a stone garden.
It also fits in well along side larger pebbles and boulders, where it really knows how to hold its own given its size.
You can spare yourself a lot of the prep work: As a solar light, “Smart Stone” doesn’t need a plug or batteries.
Place the “illuminating stone” at one of your favorite spots that is exposed to the sun on a daily basis.
Two stakes can ensure a secure hold, if needed.
The matte white plastic shell is itself robust and water-resistant.
The solar module of “Smart Stone” is discretely hidden in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs - one white and one colored.
The battery begins to charge whenever sunlight falls on the shell.
As dusk falls, the “Smart Stone” starts to illuminate on its own; you can pick the color yourself: In addition to a daylight white, you have a choice of six different, attractive colors of light.
Turning off also occurs automatically as soon as the battery power reaches a set minimum or if it starts to get bright again.
As soon as the sun shines once more, the charging cycle begins for the next day.
I already did that a number of times, it didn’t work.
It’s a shame, I would have really liked to order with you, but when you won’t apply the store credit, then I won’t order anymore out of principle.
If you decide to change it somehow, just let me know.
Otherwise, today is the last contact.
Then just send me the number for the sideboard.
It’s not as if any hardware store is open during lockdown...

Pill problems
Dear womenfolk,
I hope I do everything right here, this is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
My problem: About five years ago I started to take the pill again out of necessity, mostly because I would have such incredible pain during my period and terrible PMS beforehand.
I would like to stop with all of that, because I already have to take so much medication to deal with chronic illnesses, which I don’t really have much say in.
My main problem, surprisingly enough, is not the pain but my skin.
During my last about two year break I went from 0 to 100 pimples everywhere on my body; it was quite the explosion.
It may sound shallow but this really was a weight on me and I didn’t feel well.
This situation never really normalized over the whole two years.
Maybe someone here has some tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics routine is already fragrance-free and without much fuss, but maybe there is something that someone could recommend me.
The gynecologist didn’t really take me seriously and the GP appointment is still to come.
Thank you to everyone who read through the novel!
Yes, dear sweet skin is really something.
I had pretty bad neurodermatitis before puberty, and then a period of peace, which was followed by lichen ruber and then the whole acne thing.
I have even tried all matter of diets during the course of my chronic illness and have stuck with a sugar, milk and meat-poor mix, because nothing else has really worked for me.
It could be the case that it is really just a hormone problem, but if you just have constant construction sites all over your whole body then maybe you just stop searching for cures which always seems to fail anyway.
I already wrote everything to your colleague, Semina, I believe,
and now I have lost the record of the conversation and I don’t know, if an answer was provided to my concerns.
I have had to work in the meantime and was on the telephone and then everything was suddenly gone...
what is there to check, if there was any money there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe something was entered in wrong
but are there usually large sizes
because it is available in large for black

In the name of the people: Lay people give out judgement
They are sitting in everyday clothes at the judge’s bank in the courthouse.
A lot is depending on their decision, even if they are not wearing robes: Jurors are determining with professional judges if and for how long someone is behind bars.
Two of them are reporting in a conversation with the “Oeffentlichen” about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher regional court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges of the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Unfortunately I can’t make it back into my customer account.
Could you send me the receipt from the order number #NUMBER# once more to the mail address given above?
Can the packaging material be disposed of properly?
We have ways of keeping it for so long.
We would be using the table as our own, as was advertised by you
happily, i already ordered the same blue armchair in november and had it delivered. i would have then ordered one in grey because they are so beautiful
Does the cabinet need to be taken apart completely for pick-up and reimbursement?
And when would the pick-up be?
110 kV underground cables will be lain in 2022
The approval for laying down new high voltage cables in Tann is now legally binding.
The Lower Bavarian government’s plan-laying resolution has now cleared the way for construction, which should begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk just announced this.
The around seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation north of the municipality with the already existing 110 kV connection between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to the mast of an overhead line near Edermanning bei Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 01/03/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only been a partial delivery.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with the order number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note “delivery not possible”.
All the three other packets have arrived so I know that delivery is definitely possible.
Could you let me know how things should move forward?
Have a great start to your week!
You can forget about that, I already explained that multiple times yesterday!!
This is a cabinet made of glass and all sides are broken, glass is lying everywhere and the container is broken
The cabinet sits in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# is delaying coming to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
That means that the cabinet cannot be picked up, because no one is allowed to enter my home
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of the stool was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it’s that way for all books, that is the reason for the request to #PRS_ORG#, because it concerns a more general problem
Ref: Planning classes (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been doing a teaching internship since summer and teaching is a lot of fun for me but I am still having trouble planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped when it comes to technology, which means I really just have the board, the textbook and an overhead projector at my disposal.
At the school I can only copy b/w for free (which is frustrating for geography).
I just now require a lot of time to actually plan my teaching periods.
We are now discussing geological factors, for example, which means that every class is its own individual thing.
In principal, the methods do repeat themselves quite a bit, but on the other hand I would not like to invest way too much time just for lecturing (I need this for observing other classes, etc.).
I’m actually pretty good at sticking to the learning objective while I plan (that which I want to achieve) and then considering how I can build on top of this (for the most part I assemble a worksheet with texts from books that my students don’t have).
We have the book Terra, but I am generally not very satisfied with the assignments in the book.
Which is the reason for the worksheets.
Maybe there is a geography teacher who can help me be more time-efficient with the book.
It would really help me.
I would really like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG#, in any case, my main priority is to carry out the return as quickly as possible.
Retail is scared of the effect of the 2G rule on business around Christmas.
Most stores only allow for people who are vaccinated or recovered.
Retailers believe this to be unnecessary and are lamenting a drop in sales.
Retailers have provided a possible solution.
The 2G rule is ruining retail-essential Christmas business according to the German Trade Association (HDE).
Business with items that are not daily essentials have been suffering a drop in sales, criticizes HDE head Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of the HDE of 1100 retailors, more than 70 percent of businesses were looking pessimistically at the rest of the year.
Many have already written off Christmas sales altogether.
“What should actually be the high point of the year is now a hole without a bottom,” Genth said.
According to this, retailers with 2G entrance restrictions have lost almost a third of their pre-crises sales in the past weeks.
It is only going well for grocery sellers and online retail.
The association is demanding consequences for this dramatic development.
Purchase with masks, distance and a hygiene concept is the most secure option, said the business owner.
“2G while shopping is not getting us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he emphasized.
The current rules limit customers and require more personnel.
He requests that the armband rule be introduced on a federal level.
In that way, each customer needs to only be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and can enter all stores on that day with the armband.
Additionally, random testing should be enough in retail - as is already the case in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, spoke about the difficult Christmas business.
Most recently, the rates without 2G are at about 75 percent the pre-corona level and sales are at about 90 percent.
These numbers are sure to fall in the middle of the very important Christmas season,” said Chief Executive of “Wirtschaftswoche” Wilhelm Wellner.
Because of increased personnel and administrative overheads, there is a search going on for solutions and approvals for the centers.
The so-called armband solution is part of this search, a policy in which “the visitors bring their 2G proof to a centralized location at these centers, for example, and are then able to enter all stores with a band on their arm like at a club“. dpa
I just ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there was a problem with the frame, which yellow filler materiel tried to conceal.
It doesn’t look good.
I would really like to return the mirror and I have already put it back in the package and tapped it up.
How do I continue with the return process?
The lamp is constructed for dual balance and is based on new, flat SMD LEDs with top performance and top color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor provides for the setting of the color temperature and the brightness of the lamp allowing for extraordinary possibilities.
Apart from adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is possible to manually set the color temperature to between 3100 - 5650 K and to save the setting.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
Simple and intuitive control is a special characteristic of the controller.
The bulbs produces a light current with soft light of a high-quality and totally free of flickering.
The 120 degree lighted angle is exceptional and is able to illuminate large spaces at relatively short distances.
This includes situations that reporters run into with small spaces and short distances.
The brightness can be changed with practically no effect on the color temperature.
It is an impressive tool that works on the film set as well as in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remote controlled in television studios or when the lights are in difficult to access places.
The control panel is on the back of the lights and consists of buttons and a lighted display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, that is where the slot for NP-F batteries can be found (not included in the scope of delivery)
User Memory: There are three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to execute the settings of the memory’s individual settings, you must simply make a sustained press of one of the memory keys and that’s it.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when you turn it off such that when you turn it back on the familiar situation is restored - Very useful for working in a studio if, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with battery: One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 is that it allows you to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
Many photographers and cameramen (and camerawomen) already have these - which means they can reach back to equipment that they already own.
The DL3120 also allows you to check the battery power before coming on set - it includes a battery tester - with a value for both battery slots on the two display screens (the left battery on the upper display, the right battery on the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course also possible to continually supply the lamp with power using the mains adaptor that was delivered along with it.
Setting up the lamp is very easy.
It has a 16 mm sleeve for mounting so you can connect it directly to your tripod.
The incline can be reliably set on both sides using the adjusters.
The mechanical competency was also considered and is of extremely high value, which thus ensures a long usage life and prepares it for more difficult deployments.
A pivoting joint is also included within the scope of delivery.
It is also great that a bag is included in the scope of delivery.
This allows you to securely transport and store the lamp and all the accessories you might eventually want to buy without any issue.
That is a shame, I was given them as a present but they are too small :(
“A Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt is celebrating after a high scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the team from Hessen, which had recently lost twice in a row, seemed to be on its way to its next soccer failure.
But then the SGE turned themselves around and were able to shoot the frustration of a poor start to the season out of their soul within an hour, leading to a furious 5-2 victory. “It was crazy what the boys were able to accomplish today,” Coach Oliver Glasner said with jubilee at DAZN and spoke of “praise all around, to each and every one of them who were there”.
At the beginning, it seemed like another setback for the team from Frankfurt, who are now at place nine and still not living up to their expectations.
Patrik Schick brought the team from Leverkusen to a 2-0 lead.
What happened next deeply effected the SGE coach.
“The way the players were able to take it back and display a fantastic performance,” according to Glasner.
I am extremely happy with the performance, which we showed and also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was playing for the first time since the fourth game day and overcoming his muscle injury, really emphasized team moral.
“I think that our mentality is unbelievably great”, the 27-year-old said and was happy after checking the scoreboard, especially how it effects the viewers.
That was the party that we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner still wants to keep focused for the upcoming challenges, but sees himself well set when considering his personal situation.
It is extraordinary that all of us players are so fit in December, that we are in tip top shape.
It is pristine work by our medical department, but our players are also living extremely professionally.
Now we want to “keep going step for step and stay determined” and “execute at this same level” the challenges up until the years end.
Next on the docket is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) on Wednesday as part of English week.
I just got an email that the package would be coming back to you because of a mistake on my end.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# in order to divert it, but there’s no way that is working.
Can it directly be resent to me or do I have to wait for the money to be transferred back to me and then renew the order once more?
It would mean, sadly, that I would not order again, because it has already taken such a very long time.
Have you already sat down on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Disappointment for women’s handball in the quarter finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women’s team slumped past with hanging heads and empty eyes after a humiliating defeat against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB cashed in on a bitter loss with 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face Spain as host in the quarter final.
“We were much too anxious and had too much respect for our opponents,” was the judgement of national team coach Henk Groener.
We need to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8-2 points in second behind Denmark (10-0).
It is a shame that we were not able to get into the flow.
That was just a bad game that we need to forget,” said team captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for semifinal placement, a significant improvement is required this coming Tuesday against the second-ranked team from 2019 in order to bring back the sweet dream of first place from 2007.
The best German scorer was defender Alina Grijseels with six goals in the duel against the three-times Olympic champion Denmark.
“We just weren’t in it - not in attack or defense,” said defender Xenia Smits, advising: “We just need to quickly turn towards the future”.
From front to back it just didn’t cut it
The German team was simply not ready to jump at the whistle like in the last five tournament games.
Missed shots, technical mistakes during attack and holes in the defense was responsible for a quick 0-4 scoreboard after seven minutes.
Only the goalie Dinah Eckerle was ready to play from the start and prevented something worse with a few saves.
The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes as Grijseels successfully shot off a quick counter attack.
This didn’t turn out to be the initial spark that was hoped for.
The German women were hardly able to get into action against the aggressive coverage of the Danes - and when it did work, it usually fell short against the mostly strong performance from Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team’s goal.
That is how the game was over early with 3-10 after 20 minutes, especially since defender Mia Zschocke was given a red card a bit later following a serious foul towards her opponent.
She will be able to play again in the quarter finals, however.
Only at the very end of the first half was the DHB team performing better in the game and reached the goal at least five times before the break.
The faint hope of an underdog recovery in the second half was already gone with a 9-19 score after seven minutes.
The Groener protégés failed in all aspects and thus made it easy for the capable opponent, who is one of the final round’s medal candidates.
After that, the German team was not able to demonstrate an increase in performance and left the court as the clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
Within the context of Reddit Advent calendars we started on Nicholas Day and that was then an occasion to start discussing family traditions leading up to Christmas, Advent, Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas break.
How was that like in the past at your house?
How was it with your partner?
Would you like to pass on these traditions to your children?
What is the best part for the children?
Boots for St. Nicholas?
Backing cookies?
Tree decoration?
Playing music?
Do the presents come from Santa Claus, the Christ Child or from grandma and grandpa?
However you do it, everyone is engaged and puts energy into Christmas in order to make it as nice as possible for the family.
Whether these are traditions set in stone or whether it is a different thing every year: let us know how it goes in your family!
please send me some kind of transaction number..or anything, which could help me
Wire transfer confirmation, etc.
i would like to give away a store credit code
just like how #PRS_ORG# does gift vouchers
does that work for you?
The subject says everything, I am a vaccination doctor for mobile vaccination teams that only use (up to this point) the BionTech/Pfizer vaccine, mostly in nursing homes.
Because these have been covered for the most part now, the my future is mostly in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions (without a time limit) concerning the organizational and human aspects of the work as well as medical questions, as long they are not personal (for example, “I am taking the medication X, will that be compatible with the vaccination..”).
My area of responsibility includes explaining the immunization, treatment indicators (people qualify for a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance if there is no reason that would speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care following an allergic reaction (has not happened to me yet).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. physician’s assistants.
In the vaccination teams we often don’t have any present, rather “only” (not trying to undervalue them at all!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for preparing the vaccination, but who cannot (may not?) give vaccinations themselves, which means I am the main person who vaccinates.
The hard “Huidlerer” question: Amberger folk know the answer
What is a “Huidlerer”?
This regionalism was sent in by someone from Amberg and became a point of serious consideration on the BR TV program “Wir in Bayern”.
In contrast to many past days, the definition was not guessed by any of the people who called in during the segment “Host mi?”.
No, it is not a “nervous person”.
Neither is it a “person who needs everything quickly”.
The people heard from the TV moderator that these were totally wrong.
The man from Amberg provided the solution to this, and thereby astonished many of the people from Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned: “A ‘Huidlerer’ is a rag with which you clean out the oven.”
Antony Rowley, a dialect researcher who has been consulted as an expert for Bavarian TV for years, confirmed this.
Adding the note that this has been a typical Upper Palatinate word derived in some way from the more common regionalism “Houdern”.
Which then filled in a knowledge gap, probably even for quite a few people who had lived in the Amberg area for awhile.
I have not been able to buy books for the last 2 weeks.
After I confirm there is always the following error notification: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have read the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it with the PC, synchronized it and patched it.
Nothing helped.
Picking tires for a road bike - life without popped tires?
This morning I woke up with a fiery drive because I still wanted to at least train a bit in the upcoming weeks in preparation for my upcoming bicycle tour.
It was as easy as that and I drove my road bike which I had bought on eBay the day before.
The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened which is always waiting for you in the intercity (this time: thanks goes to Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the road.
Pop, a loud hiss and my back tire was no longer up for riding the rest of the trip.
Because of it being a work day, I didn’t really have the chance to acquire a spare tire and tube, I had to turn back halfway through in a bad mood and take the next workable train back home.
It was not the worst downer ever, maybe it is even better if I practice changing tires one more time before I leave to go on the tour.
But now I am posed with a question and hope that you will be able to help me.
Because I have a relatively long stretch of road and many days in front of me, I would very much like to not run into this problem on a regular basis.
This time it really wasn’t that bad, because the tires were from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had already rode 120 km by 2 PM on the day I came to pick up my bicycle) and because he had described them as suboptimal, because he had already been wearing them down for many years.
But if I think about having to change tires every 80-90 km on the tour, then I am already in a really bad mood :D
I just got into a discussion with an older man at the train platform, who asked me quite surprised, why I don’t have the Marathon Plus tires, these are supposed to be impossible to pop.
Now that certainly does sound tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have no desire to give out €40 per tire in order to just be disappointed.
At the same time, I ask myself: I am using 25x622 race tires at the moment, I believe.
This is (apparently?) just like the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority of tires are actually wider.
Is that the real problem?
Or would you recommend that I really get different tires in general for the road bike?
The Schwalbe website seems to be of one opinion! Would common sense tend to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and take care!
Car launched into a tree: Driver is fatally wounded
The 53-year-old smashed for unknown reasons into a traffic island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten and then continued into incoming traffic, according to police.
That is when a front on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old occurred.
The car of the 53-year-old was then launched into a tree and the man in the car was stuck inside.
The 27-year-old and the 23-year-old both suffered heavy injuries and were brought into a nearby hospital.
yes we have deleted all books everything has been newly authorized and new books have been downloaded

After the release of our new high-end full-range speakers B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series got some new blood.
SOLO 15 is the new offshoot and is optically reminiscent of the larger models with B 200 - 6 OHM .
However, a suitably designed food was included directly in the construction proposal, which would raise the speaker to the correct, audible position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can be adjusted lengthwise to fit the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people, for whom maximum volume doesn’t really play a big role, but for whom an especially high level of sound quality should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not up to the task of producing such practically unfiltered, large sound pressure levels.
That doesn’t mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
Rather it appears especially mature, impressive and accurate for its size.
Concerning tone, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble rise.
This is usually the case with full-range speakers in order to optimize the strongly increasing bunching of the higher frequencies.
Directed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 is convincing with a very clear and fine sound.
If turned slightly to the side, the high tones can be reduced, which allows for a warmer sound.
Thanks to the directed sound, the positioning of the individual components of the piece of music in an optimal stereo triangle is sharp as a knife and astonishingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which should be mentioned, ensure fine dynamics that are in a league of their own.
The SOLO 15 is not just supplementing the SOLO series, rather it is expanding it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
Like all of our assembly kits, we recommend that you consider the final optics of the speakers in order to plan the necessary alterations into its construction.
For instance, if you would like to apply a veneer to the case, the lowering of the speaker need to be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies another materiel.
After all boards have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), a 8 mm hole should first be bored into the floor boards at the appropriate position in order later lead a cable through it without any issues.
Using a router, the speaker opening in the front is the next to come such that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be setup level.
This opening should be allow for a 45° chamber on the bac side in order to create the largest possible open area space inside of the speaker case.
The four screw points on the B 100 - 6 OHM get thereby an interruption of the chamfer, as is shown in the image, “Detail Chamfer”.
Begin here with the actual construction of the box, position one of the two side walls on a level plane in front of you.
The back wall, the top, the front and the floor are all glued onto this piece.
At the same time, the three reinforcements should be set and glued.
The material strength of the reinforcements can vary according to need, in that you can, for example, use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of constructing them out of 16 mm MDF yourself.
The second side is then attached in the next phase.
After that, all boards of the foot, that is, the two sides as well as the front.
It is easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear panel by using a suitable circular hole saw or Forstner drill.
After that, use a circular miller to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the foot board can also be rounded here.
Then the foot board is securely glued to the foot of the case and screwed on additionally with long wooden screws.
After that comes the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker case and the terminal.
After the housing unit has been cleared of all dust (vacummed/blown), begin with the laying of the cables.
The easiest way is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
For this, push the whole, unshortened cable inch by inch through the 8 mm hole in the foot up to the terminal opening and let it poke out there about 30 cm.
At the top part of the case, the cable is guided through the speaker opening and then just left to hang out loose there.
The crossover unit is then prepared and installed.
The construction plan of the crossover unit, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken out of the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connecting terminal is screwed in, then next comes the sealing of the 8 mm cable hole in the interior of the box, which has not been entirely closed off.
With some dexterity, you can let hot glue drop onto the opening through the 35 mm bass reflex opening, which then seals it.
The seal can then be checked through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM with a small lamp.
The dampening now occurs according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and secured with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is then shortened to the designated length of 28 mm (whole length of the tube) and inserted in.
A length of dampening material is then cut in two and loosely placed inside of the housing unit for dampening purposes.
The opening of the bass reflex canal should be kept open.
Can I already place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are going to put on the OSCAST again this year!
> It’s not possible for us - for obvious reasons - to have more than four people come into the studio, which certainly means more planning and explains the short term announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per button here, such at least 7 beans will be in the stream for the 2021 Oscars, and hopefully thousands of you following!
> We are doing our best to avoid delays and other issues.
But hey, it is still a pandemic, and because of that we are going to do our best to try to accompany the Oscars with as much entertainment as possible.
> It will start at about 12:30 AM.
Make sure to keep your drinks cold, plan some good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
