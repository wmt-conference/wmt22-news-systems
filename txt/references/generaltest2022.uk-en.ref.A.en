Good afternoon, sorry, there was no Internet connection and I couldn’t send it earlier. Thank you
Please tell me the exact address where I should clean up tomorrow, the key code, and the time when the current guests leave and new guests check in tomorrow.
Unfortunately, I have to decline Your offer, because in fact during this time I have already found a job.
Sorry, but I can’t decline their offer.
Sometimes it seems to me that my thoughts in Czech translated with a translator differ from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that we’d bring you a surprise when you go to school.
Hello, I agree to the course.
However, please tell me can I start earlier?
I do not live in Prague, so there may be difficulties with transportation.
If there are no options, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people went on a rally again, and the Russians did not have time to disperse
As participants in the event told journalists, Kherson residents held a rally, and then the Russian military arrived at the scene with equipment to disperse them.
“We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived,” said one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, local residents had traditionally gathered for protests at the Svobody Square (“Freedom Square”) – near the building of the regional state administration and regional council.
This square and the building are currently controlled by Russian armed forces who use weapons against protesters and abduct people.
It was reported that on April 3 armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful protesters in Kakhovka.
As the Ukrinform agency reported, residents of the Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also abduct residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave Kherson the honorary title of “Hero City”.
On February 24 Putin, the President of the Russian Federation, started full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
Russian troops are shooting at key infrastructure facilities and destroying them, conduct massive bombardments of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launcher systems and ballistic missiles.
I often dream of my father here.
He died the day after my birthday.
But in general, dreams are good.
Hana, good afternoon.
I did as you wrote me and the phone started charging!
Very good news!
Thank You!
We can meet for an hour or two, and then I will go home, because I don’t have necessary things with me
A janitor in red overalls pulls a rocket to the dustheap. All quiet on the Kharkiv front
You can book a TV with a set-top box and remote control, pots, pillows, chairs, pans
Oleh also found me a part-time job for me – cleaning 2 flats rented to tourists by the day.
These flats are in the center of Prague.
Will it be convenient for you to go to the bank with me on Monday? Or on another day
Good afternoon, yes, it would be good if you could do it today, as you wrote, at 5 pm
That’s why I read the Bible, the Koran etc. to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the house to clean up?
I mean do you have pleasant dreams?
In the appendix to this report I am sending you a list of vacancies offered by employers to us.

They’ve got tickets for April 20.
I wish they have a safe journey.
When you arrive, please give me a phone call. The doorbell doesn’t work
A cheaper one would be better… We have to move, because European prices are too high for us…
I need to check it on-site and try where it hurts
Now he wants to press all my sore points, he is aware about them.
But I absolutely do not care about this.
I didn’t want to discuss him and his drama in the presence of Misha yesterday.
You can’t preserve it in cans, it can’t stand when it rains) When there is no rain, I’ll preserve more🙂
so I just feel uncomfortable in my own body
This is my Ukrainian classmate
Poor Olexandra is running here from one corner to another; there are so many things here that she doesn’t know where to look first, and she wants to be everywhere at the same time
only these rags should be used for steamers
Good morning, I’ll come to you for the printer in 20 minutes
Can pay you back for the doctor?
Your coffee has already arrived, I can bring it tomorrow)
We can leave the purchases in our car, then we’ll pick the children and things up
I have already written to you twice :)) but I make a double round by trains.
I didn’t understand: will me and Valya be both together in the morning?
Or did you mean that we’d clean up ourselves, and you’d just control it?
Maybe we’ll swap shifts with Valya? Valya in the morning, and me in the afternoon?
My mother will live here in a dorm, as the accommodation fee is low.
The main thing is that I have where to live
Sasha was not at school today, I emailed her teacher.
Hello 👋🏻 I got sick, so it would be better to postpone our meeting to the next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake.
Traditional Ukrainian dishes are borsch, varenyky, etc.
I have no favorite dishes, I like to try various dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like cooking?
I want to be busy with something
To be more precise, there’s a train, but there are no seats
Sorry, but we’re a little late.
Lucia, can I work as an assistant at the kitchen?
It is very good that Yulya will be able to go to work.
I went to their flat last night.
It’s very cozy and comfortable there.
On Tuesday Pablo will tell me if there is work at the brewery for Nazar and when he should come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can take any train:
Mr. Zelenskyy: Mariupol – the heart of the war – will stop beating – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that battles for the eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians may abandon negotiations and reoccupy the deoccupied territories.
Direct speech: “You know, today Mariupol is the heart of this war.
It’s beating – we’re fighting, we are strong.
If it stops beating, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city – ed.) are the people who have attracted a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol is, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the Joint Forces Operation area, and if they are stronger, then we’ll be closer to negotiations and will have advantages during the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our position is weak in all these areas, we may be unable to wait for the meeting.
Because in this case Russia will take all the steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have deoccupied for now.
They can go for it too.
Then our position during the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, even uninteresting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we just state facts.
We believe in our result, in our victory…”
Details: Mr. Zelenskyy also said that it is difficult to negotiate after tortures of the Ukrainians, but “we may not lose the opportunities for a diplomatic solution, if we have such.”
Direct speech: “People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine’s independence, but… every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end either with peace or with millions of victims.
And even if there are millions of victims, the war comes to an end.
Yes, we must fight – but for life.
You can’t fight for dust when there’s nothing left, no people left.”
Good afternoon, do you still have free places at the Czech language course for adults from 7 pm on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Kutna Hora.
and these two are my cousins
Yes, I understand.
I’m not sure I’ll have time to clean up by 1 pm, because the apartment is big and there’s a lot to clean up.
I’ll try to clean it up quickly, but I don’t promise that.
I’ll write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominica, who purchases consumables?
Is this procedure constant, or do we need to order them as required?
Due to the change in aesthesis of the Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of the Ukrainian literature, studying the state of
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in the modern literature that allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.
Maybe you know how I should report online that I’ve already found a job and no longer apply for help?

Of course, we can come, thank you!
5. What education, apart from the Czech language courses, would you like to get?
Oh, how difficult everything is :)
In Ukraine, mobile operators work by phone or online 24 hours a day regardless of holidays :)
I’m going to work tomorrow morning around 6:00-6:20, I’ll be home in the afternoon.
If you have time, we’ll try to change the plan tomorrow in the evening

We sincerely thank you.

My name is Ciara; we are from Ukraine, me, my 7-year-old daughter and Mom.
I’m looking for a job… But there’s a problem: I can’t stay on my feet for a long time after the operation, so it’s very difficult to find something suitable for me.
I’m temporarily living in Prague 9. I’m ready to move anywhere if I find a job. I’ll be very grateful for advice or suggestions)
But if you don’t want to talk to me, I’m sad
Why did you decide that you did not need such experience?
Every situation is meant for something.
Preferably for a person to change, especially spiritually.
I’ll give you this money, as soon as the bank approves it.
About 30,000 UAH for debts you have, plus 30,000 UAH for the future.
Janka, I hope you are fine, and your grandmother won’t call me bad words.
I’m trying to put Sasha to sleep… He needs to get some sleep…
You need a code for the canteen
The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who took part in committing war crimes in the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region.
According to the Ukrinform agency, the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports it in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of the servicemen of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade who are directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha,” the statement says.
The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine notes that all the war criminals will be brought to justice and prosecuted for crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine.
The list is available at the link.
As the Ukrinform agency reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military have been recorded in liberated towns and villages.
On April 1 Anatoliy Fedoruk, the Mayor of Bucha, announced that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Attorney-general Iryna Venedyktova said that on April 3 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the premises of the Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24 President of russia vladimir putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
The troops of Russian invaders are shooting at key infrastructure facilities and destroying them, conduct massive bombardments of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launcher systems, ballistic missiles and aerial bombs.
Good afternoon, I apologize, but I will not be able to work for you, because I’ll fly to Canada soon.
Immediately after the dash there are formal names, after the slash there are slang expressions, in parentheses there are abbreviations used in the timetable.
I don’t want to bother you, have some rest
I saw the weather forecast. It will be cold
I don’t need branded clothes.
Just good clothes at reasonable prices and right sizes.
We visited a store at the train station
Jobs being offered. Are there the ones that do not require me to speak the language?
It’s important; if there is such a tradition, then I need to know about it to get ready)
I thought it will happen in a week, but the situation is heating up, we constantly hear sirens
Tomorrow there may be a bad connection on the road.
I’m grateful to everyone for the experience, even if it is painful.
I believe that I gained experience from each situation for myself, so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are entered as numbered additions in writing which are part of this Regulation.
I’m sure there will be no problems with this.
Many people in Ukraine also celebrate it this week.
It depends on the religion.
If a person a Greek or Roman Catholic.
in the beginning you can try it for free
Maybe you could write the payment procedure to us, we will pay ourselves.
We have the document that the children receive at the end of the school year, it’s a school progress record, and they receive a certificate at birth and when they get married
Yes! He’s on it as an experienced driver! But I’m not sure if it’s better. I worry about the walls of the apartment
They write what needs to be filled in, a biography, in Czech…
I’ll try to be there in time. Because I still have to go to the town hall to sign the documents
Isn’t your wife angry that you are on the phone all the time?
In my daily prayers I thank God and the Mother of God for you.
Let they cover you with their veil of love and warmth tonight.
My heart belongs to You.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
The location, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that we’d bring you a surprise when you go to school.
It would be great, I have money to rent a flat for two months in Olomouc, I don’t care about the district; I will be very grateful.
The majority of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal torturing civilians to the north of Kyiv.
The photos of tortured and shot people have embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Many people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. This is exactly what I was sadly waiting for…
I evacuated my children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then my female colleagues with children, and only after that I returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014 I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine and I had no doubt at all that my family wouldn’t be spared if the outskirts of Kyiv were occupied.
Because I was and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained the same since 1918.
It just can’t exist without terror, it is based on terror.
In 1937 one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
Several years ago the Zhytomyr SBU was let to make a copy of my great-grandfather’s shooting case: the whole case is over a hundred pages long, but the death sentence is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused person was illiterate and denied his guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, from a poor “one-household” nobility, he’s never been a serf.
The fact that he lived in a small village and had several cows was enough to condemn the plowman and breadwinner of young children to death.
Relatives were not even told about the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people had been taken from the village at that time and everybody had been killed, except for two persons who agreed to give false testimony.
The criminal case contains the name of the squealer Shariy.
The former speaker of our Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I’m not surprised if his relative was a KGB informer.
It runs in the family, as you know…
The three executioners who doomed the peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
While analyzing the case of my great-grandfather I became interested in various information resources.
In russia there are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources like “Immortal Barrack” that remind us of the events during those years.
Indeed, in modern russia the descendants of the NKVD workers found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors that took place 70–80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers – the system first discredited and then destroyed them.
They allegedly found files with child pornography on a computer, put a person into prison for it, and he died there soon.
The KGB workers still kill those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes during the last century.
So why are you surprised with their actions now?!
The most abominable features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th–19th centuries cover the millennial Horde tradition.
And then they conducted a savage genetic experiment on what happened, killing the intelligentsia during several waves of the red terror.
Look at the semi-French film “The Chekist” of 1992, that’s how it was.
So you saw my photos in a bikini
Can you ask my wife what I can buy to prevent coughing?
Sorry, I have no one to ask about it
I also wanted to ask you if you know where the children went, because Halya can’t find them
Lubos, Ihor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (He has a day off and can go, because the car has not been checked at the station today).
We are very sorry for bothering you so much.
Thanks, you help us a lot!!

your coffee will arrive today)
I have the first “bicycle” after my son.
What do the girls do when they return from school?
We arrived at the place where we were lodged from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are fine.
But there is a big disadvantage: some men live here who drink alcohol and smoke indoors, loud music is the smallest “distraction”, the smell of cigarettes, drunk men and me with my children… To be honest, it’s scary to go to bed.
Please help us with accommodation for some money.
But we need a safe, smoke free place.
In the room there’s a smell of cigarettes, as if they are smoking right here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, shouting something about what he dislikes. It’s very scary.
I beg you to help me🙏🏼
The main thing is that we understood each other
It’s very positive, such a wonderful kindergarten, the instructors are so nice.
You do so much for us, it’s unbelievable, thank you very much❤️
Good evening Stephanie, Agatha wants to take part in the game, she’s missing it 😉
We do not reach that hatch
So far we are not ready to pay such money, we’ll wait for help and then make some plans
How do I get to the flat today to clean it up?
Should I call you to open it for me when I’m at the main entrance?
I want to find a cake for Karina, if I have time
Sorry, I forgot to write to you
Everything was fine yesterday.
We talked about children with special needs and their education system in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how we found the dog, the pug.
Everyone is following the Facebook page.
They asked you to send best regards to you and say that it is very interesting to follow the news.
They also talked about Romani people and their privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child came and the parents did not understand Czech at all, then after work I would help them by phone.
I need to change bed sheets, 2 sets.
Holidays are fine for me.
I have free time, and we visit only Easter rites.
Thank you🏵️🏵️🏵️I will give you the details about the work today
Danya liked it a lot, thank you for organization
So Nestor has only a running nose, and Galynka has a temperature of 37,7 and 38 in the evening
The queue is very slow on the General Chapek St.
Everybody has a chance.
The main thing is that love is true and mutual.
I do not know how it happens in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly selfish and mercantile.
But I have a problem with that; if I don’t love a person, nothing will happen.
Yes, we took it home and then to my aunt right away.
She was extremely grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
There were tears in her eyes.
She asked about an old blanket and pillow, if it’s possible.
But this is not mandatory. Only if you have ones. I’m very grateful to you too.
Of course, I was sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions to God about why there were situations in my life that just made me lose faith in everything.
Do small groceries work? I need to buy bread and some other products.
I just decided to leave, and you held a meeting
This is true, but we still are unfamiliar with the area and do not know where everything is located. Today we were looking for a supermarket for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so we need two large blankets
Even now I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad speak only Russian, or other relatives too?
Can the children come to Valya and play in the hall?
Well, then let’s take a risk :)
I’m also glad to meet you
I talked to Volodymyr about accommodation, I asked him for advice if I should wait until they find me or look for it myself; the ladies who live with us here said that we need to go to the “Muzeina” subway station, there’s an institution there that helps to find housing
I’ll overcome the barrier for the sake of the little one 😂🙃😂
I even didn’t know the answers to some of their questions
Yes, Thursday would be OK if possible
I can’t call the doctor, because I haven’t passed the food license inspection yet.
But I can’t call him, as I ran out of money in my account.
I can’t top up my phone account, because I don’t understand Czech online banking and can’t do that from the Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafone application I can neither change the plan to make calls and use the Internet, nor top up the account.
I’m already going crazy
Where is the price for a cheek, and face… The heading doesn’t sound right, what did you mean?
I’m ashamed not to have a job
She’s just written that she’s at school in class
Sorry for bothering you, I was just worried
But it’s closer to when they leave Ukraine to know for sure that they will arrive.
Because everyone’s life is endangered there now.
Yes. The size for 10–11 years. But our sizes do not match. We need to try everything on
I am looking for everything for the house and children.
Thanks to the people who welcomed me; I live in a chapel; they always ask if I need anything, and I feel embarrassed to answer; I’m trying to find everything myself.
I’ve just come home, having breakfast now :)
Please do not explain anything, imagine that I am not here
It’s impossible to reply without the CV submitted
I won’t be able to tell it to my mother :)
And I’m really a little uncomfortable right now that I couldn’t help myself from feelings before we left the apartment… Like tonight…
God help Yura to fall asleep 🙏 Maybe I’ll go to bed right after that to get some sleep.
I will write to You in any case.
Hello Susanna, can you help me? I received a payment for March. Is it for me with Julia or just for me? I can’t figure out why I got such an amount.
Yes, you can make copies of passports when it is convenient for you :)
We have one of the best lyceums of the region in our village
😂😋it’s fun to talk to you, and I even like it 😉
I contacted Caritas, they offered temporary place to live for a week or two, but I need permanent housing where I could be with my child, and there are less flats remaining
I’ve watered flowers. Everything is fine. Everybody had rest and looks beautiful.
According to the “European Pravda”, Welt writes about it citing sources in the Ukrainian government circles.
According to this source, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, cost 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the version for Boxer armored personnel carriers for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks during battles have to get relatively close to the targets of the enemy, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As the Ukrainian government circles report citing a proposal by the KMW, self-propelled howitzers will be supplied under a circular pattern.
The Bundeswehr will supply 100 of its howitzers to Kyiv as soon as possible, and the emerging gaps will then be closed by the industry in the second phase.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the contract is signed, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
They will not be supplied in full before 2027.
Are we together till or after noon?
Thanks, we will find out how to top-up an account and call you back. I’ll write back to you. Thank you
I’m going to work tomorrow without passing the board, and when my doctor recovers, I’ll pass it; have I got it right?
How can I now change my T-Mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns?
Hello, I’m sorry. Can you tell me if you need a worker?
I can wash the floor or dishes.
I’m from Ukraine; unfortunately, I can’t speak your language, but I need work.
I’m young and active, I’m 21.
I agree to any job.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I study every day, so I think I’ll learn everything I need to work without any problems
I talk too much with you today, probably you should go to bed to work tomorrow
I’ll take these trousers to work in if I can. The size is OK for me.
You are smart, and everything will be fine🙏 Have some rest, gather strength and beauty by good sleep!!!🇺🇦❤️🇨🇿
On her birthday Katka tries to commit suicide on the Charles Bridge
Did you manage to make friends with anybody?
Yes, we wanted to solve the problem with the card before Easter. We don’t have Internet banking and don’t know how to install it. What do we need to do?
Should we ask the landlord?
Say goodbye whenever you leave
Of course, we can do that after 5 pm.
Can I wash the laundry in the flat tomorrow and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hi. Yes, I’ll be waiting for you at 6 o’clock
How much did I study for this profession?
If it was warm, it would be very good
I applied online. I’ll try to go there today after work.
We are fine. We are coping with stove heating, we have some experience; we have gas in Ukraine, but since it is very expensive, we heated the stove with firewood
Good afternoon, Lena, please tell me where there is a stationery shop nearby
Tomorrow we’re going to Prague to have a look at the apartment
Everything settled on its own
I have to take Karinka with me
I started to wash the laundry, came home and translated the inscription on a chair near the door of the laundromat, channel repairs, can I wash or turn the laundromat off?
It says that my status will change within 24 hours. But why? It’s ridiculous!😂😂😂
My ex-husband can’t calm down, he writes poems for me ) a real drama).
I want everything that officially connects me with him to end as soon as possible🙏
Thank you, because we are not very good at it
And we even have handmade article from the nursery
Sorry, I got something wrong.
I didn’t understand Czech so well then.
I must have devised something.
Right, they go to school; yes, there are three of them, because Halya and Svyatoslav study remotely, graduate from school in Ukraine and receive graduation certificates; they need to enter the university in autumn
Can you tell me how to get downtown?
I’ll share my thoughts with you.
For me marriage is a sacrament between two persons who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A husband and wife solve issues in their family themselves, especially without participation of their relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we meet.
Why don’t we try it this way for now?
I rented a car for 9 people, we’ll come with Maryana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you have to leave?
yes, I’m happy to listen to jazz
Thank you, I’m working at this application, we were told about it at the Czech language courses on Wednesday
During the last four years I have not allowed anyone to approach me, I read many books on philosophy and tried to understand myself.
When they hurt a lot, it’s hard to trust anyone.
But you have to try again, everyone is going through something that changes him or her forever, this is life.
Martin, we’re going to bed already.
Thank you for such a nice and fun day.
We liked everything very much.
We really feel at home.
During the whole evening the children told Dad and all the grandparents how fine they felt at your place.
Greetings from the girls! We wish you the best for the holidays😉
Where did we have a look now?
I hope my son will leave this slaughterhouse alive.
Let’s go today, maybe we’ll need to do something.
How can we contact them, so that they opened the door?
Are there any improvements in overcoming the coronavirus pandemic?
I am very grateful to you for helping people. If you can, help us too. To find a cheap place to live.
We are now in Slapy, we found a shelter at our friends’ place for a while.
My family: a husband, a 6-year-old daughter, an 11-year-old son.
My husband has already found a job as a driver.
I’m a masseuse and a rehabilitation specialist, I’m looking for a job.
So that the children could attend school and I could work, we need a house close to civilization.
I just desperately have to give it away today!
It doesn’t matter. We’ll wait until tomorrow. I did not know that even large stores would be closed.
I cook cabbage rolls as follows: I dilute 3–4 tablespoons of tomato paste in 0.5 liter of water and bring it to a boil.
I put cabbage rolls in a saucepan and pour this sauce over them.
I stew them in the oven for about 1.5 hour.
How much money do I have on this account?
I have to bring everything

Lidia has already been admitted to school, but she’ll go there on Tuesday due to illness; I’ve informed her teacher today
I’m sitting, wearing headphones in my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the children.
I want to be with you very much.
To make you happy 😢.
I don’t know, darling, how are you?
I know it’s hard for you.
But I think that we are together. That we are a couple.
I’d say there will be a lot of work after the war.
So I’m not afraid that I won’t find it there.
I can do a lot of things.
That’s why I’m not afraid that I didn’t get any of them.
I’m only not sure about accommodation.😢😢😟
I need to pass an exam to get a license for foods. Can you do this for me?
Please tell if I should to prepare a flat for 5 guests tomorrow.
As I understand, the fifth place is in the room with a TV set?
Should I unfold the sofa and cover it with bed sheets?
Can we stay at your place, till Ms. Marharyta finds us a place to live?
don’t worry about that
It’s not new and has already been used, it’s working, but not needed.
Please write the address in Czech, we’ll try to find it at the map
I don’t know how much free space is there, so I can’t plan anything about the furniture; this week I want to finally have a look at that apartment and then understand what furniture I need
Sorry for not replying for so long; it was a working day, it’s hard to adapt
Is that enough so far?
I want you to be happy and safe, and I want to finally be with you to give you a nice hug.
To kiss you in the morning, to say how beautiful you look.
There is already a crib and bathtub for the child, I’ve found some stuff to start with
Don’t forget that you promised to help me when you can, but please don’t give the shirt off your back 🤫😟😉🙃
I want a haircut called “bowl”
Oleh is sick: he has running nose and coughs. You shouldn’t take Yan with you, so that he doesn’t get infected
But I’ll be a little bit later – around 8. Is it OK?
I don’t want you to misunderstand me
Because I worry and want everything to be fine!?
Because of these excursions we didn’t even talk about it!
I understand how important it is for you!
And I’m silent about myself (for me it’s just a peak that I can’t reach)!
how are you feeling today? 😅 after celebrating?
hi, I’m sorry, I’ve just woken up, I didn’t sleep well
Sorry for bothering you.
I was upset that me and Kolya started translating the test bad yesterday.
I’ll ask Hryhoriy Denysenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can help them with anything?
If there’s an opportunity, I want to study the mathematical terms better over the weekend.
Geometry is difficult in general, but we have to work with Kolya to make no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also hope for this very much
So she is very glad to receive any gift
I’d like to connect the Internet to my Czech account
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop I met a Ukrainian woman – Victoria.
This girl is a child, but she is alone here… Her eyes are full of tears and grief…
I could not stay away.
We agreed that we would be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall 29 is specially designed to submit and process applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a spare card
No, you shouldn’t, I’m an ordinary person
So that she wasn’t afraid that nobody came
I didn’t go there. Yes, I baked it myself.  I can do that! The most important thing is that you showed me how to turn on the oven.
So are you leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, among others, the President of Germany.
He spoke about “the joint basis of international law and human dignity, freedom of people to choose their way and to live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This basis we must protect – this is also part of our responsibility related to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past show themselves today in new clothes,” he said, then “for us Germans, there can be only one answer to this: Never again!
The fight must continue.”
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of peaceful civilians, starves inhabitants of cities it blocks and lets them die of diseases.
Russian troops commit mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually reminding of the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For over a month, Germans see it on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany implements sanctions, gives humanitarian aid and also weapons, which was unimaginable not long ago.
Germany drags their feet with delivering the heavy weapons Ukraine needs.
But “Never Again!” means not only to speak out against Swastikas.
It means to fight with all you have against mass killings, genocides, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way to without risks and sacrifices defeat the evil and stop the atrocities happening in Ukraine.
One song for you for the night
We agree, please arrange a tour and write to us when we should gather
Everyone was sick, but Lydia wasn’t, they had Omicron, a new variant of coronavirus
Then I’ll do it tomorrow
I use this coupon instead of a card
Sorry for the delayed documents.
The conductor sold the ticket for me for 2,000 UAH
Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago Ukrainian sociology studies showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% were in favor of this.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donbass the number of NATO opponents started falling, and, on the contrary, the number of its supporters increased.
After the start of a full-scale war against Russia Ukrainian sociologists recorded the highest level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and NATO’s assistance during the war, now there is much criticism of the Alliance and its member countries for late delivery of weapons, refusal to close the skies, and unwillingness to “irritate” Russia.
Besides, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce its aspiration to join the Alliance because of Russia’s position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military ones.
In the new episode of the “Bloody Questions” podcast we, together with the editor of the European Pravda, talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and what the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our NATO membership prospects has never been so close, and why security guarantees discussed during the negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is happening here
My Wolt partner indicates that my application is pending.
I submitted it through this mobile app
There is no visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to get it, because it was issued in Poland where pesel was given instead of a visa.
We will definitely write to You!
Denys left today in a good mood.
He agreed to meet near the school with a boy from Ukraine whom he met yesterday, so that he could show him everything.
So I hope he is fine
Because I don’t like it this way, I can’t do it for a long time
In Ukraine they report that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine
I’m going and leaving the children alone; I’ll be waiting there for 3–4 hours and going home, because I can’t leave them for longer.
And I need to take them with myself at 6–7 o’clock in the morning
Yes, my heart was broken.
Yes, I had sincere feelings towards this man, but he didn’t behave very well, and I abandoned him.
After a while he came back and apologized.
I refused to him.
Then after a while he called and said that he had undergone heart surgery.
He asked just to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during this time.
Then I had some problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
It was mutual help.
And I thought, maybe I should treat him differently.
He proposed to me, and died in two days.
Thus, God himself decided our destinies.
What does being ready for marriage mean for you?
And he speaks only Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find accommodation, and I am very happy about it ☺ Now I have a place to live where I can be with the baby.
Could you tell me about it earlier?

My mood is better
Okay, let’s talk about something else, I don’t sleep anyway. When I’m falling asleep, I start dreaming of being bombed…
God is never late, everything has its time and place.
I don’t think he wants to rob me :)
I understand perfectly the price of unskilled labor and realize that here I won’t get the job like the one I had at home in Kyiv, and I won’t earn the money I earned at home either.
But I just can’t sit and do nothing, because different dark thoughts come to mind, so I have to occupy myself with some physical activities
Documents are processed at the airport from 7 am to 7 pm, at other times you can just wait.

He visits you

I can’t remember this schedule in any way )
The Russian army threatens to strike missiles at Kyiv: they say that they “have not done that before.”
Mr. Konashenkov’s direct speech: “We see attempts of sabotage and attacks of facilities in Russia by the Ukrainian troops.
If such cases continue, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including the ones in Kyiv, which the Russian army has previously refrained from.”
The Russians have been firing missiles at Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion into Ukraine by the Russian occupation troops.
On February 25 the remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital’s district of Poznyaky.
On February 26 a Russian missile hit a multistoried building on the Valery Lobanovsky Prospect.
On March 1 the Russians hit a TV-tower in the Dorohozhychi district near Babyn Yar killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2 the Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying over the Southern Railway Station in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14 the wreckage of the shot down missile of the invaders shattered a house and trolleybus in the Kurenivka district in Kyiv.
On March 18 a Russian missile hit a residential community in Vynohradar killing one person and injuring 19 people, including four children.
On March 21 Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall in Vynohradar killing at least 4 people.
Vitali Klitschko, the Mayor of Kyiv, stated on April 13 that it was too early to return home for the capital’s residents evacuated from the city.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still make missile strikes at Kyiv, and, besides, there were many mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
On April 12 the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned that the Russians planned to carry out a series of terrorist attacks in Russia to blame Ukrainians for that and justify the Russian army’s brutality against civilians.
On April 1 an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April the local authorities of Belgorod stated that a “Ukrainian shell” allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are breaking out in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the Ukrainian sky.
But Mr. Zelenskyy speaks rather to their electorate and communities in general, than to them.
The Ukrainian leader is doing something that any of his predecessors could not do with his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of many thousands in the squares of the largest cities in Europe.
Mr. Zelenskyy does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European nations that elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of strength, emotions and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While Mr. Biden is strongly objecting to closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Though Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine’s joining to the European Union, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don’t want anybody to think that we are fraudsters.
It is better to give the money you raise to the people in need.
I can come to you and we’ll decide everything on the spot. I want to help in any way
But the air is clean, it’s a plus😀
It says that I have a plan “For two without the Internet,”and on the contrary, I asked to order the Internet.
I do not understand the terms of this plan
Do we have another room today? Or, as usual, only the stairs from top to bottom?
I’m already on the road and you’re on the train
But I will not stop loving you, you are everything for me.
A financial advisor is in charge of this loan.
So it takes a few days.

My name is Sasha, and I came to Prague from Luhansk.
I am a certified masseuse and nurse with 27 years of experience in neurology.
I offer therapeutic massages and a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian and Czech, and I’m studying a lot.
Contact data: ------ I’d also like to get a letter, so that the Czechs could write to you through a translator, SMS do not work here, they don’t have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won’t be able to agree.
Don’t you really need this pricelist?
It helps people see what they are worth and what they have for this.
If you don’t need the pricelist, I won’t post it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I’ll do it.
By the way, you didn’t want to write to me today… for some reason
Don’t worry, I didn’t come to ask for anything.
To be more precise, I’m asking only for attention today.
I want to say a lot today, so please be patient.
Is your imagination OK?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan some purchases and vacations.
You have dreams.
You are planning to buy the dress you saw yesterday in the shopping mall.
Tomorrow in the evening, after work.
Your brain can’t perceive this.
It clings to the old reality.
You call to work to find out if you should go to work today.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Till something becomes clear.
There is hope… that it’s not for long.
Now they will agree… Something will happen.
Your brain refuses to perceive this…
Where should I go? I have no relations anywhere.
I’ve got only $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Our bosses did not pay salaries to many people at our jobs.
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How can I provide for my children? Where can I live?
You can’t take a lot of stuff.
You haven’t taken almost anything from home… You have to travel 1000 kilometers.
You don’t know if you have any food for them tomorrow.
You take children all over Prague every day from morning to evening.
And what’s next? You don’t know. How much time will it last? You don’t know. The children ask for sweets. And you don’t have them. It’s expensive for you.
And you hear everywhere– we don’t have it for you.
We have a choice – to stay there and put children at risk or try to rescue here
She was very happy with those hearts and things that her children presented to her when she came to school
You should have called me when you came.
I’ll write to you in the evening
Yes, I believe only in God and entrust my life to him

I already thought that you fell in love with a Ukrainian girl and do not have time to talk to me 😇
I understood the menu and have even made the order

Now I’ll send you a photo of the business card of the lady that teaches English to me.

Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be very good to know a person from Ukraine
If you want, you can stay with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don’t you want to meet after 4 pm?
What are your general impressions with the first week?

Today we are happy – our town of Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, our troops came in.

These are small entrepreneurs who have opened volunteer headquarters at their facilities and shops.
These are tractor drivers who go out into the field actually under fire, because it’s time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to travel in humanitarian convoys to temporarily occupied territories to take aid there and pick up people.
These are heroic guides who fearlessly go to the active combat zone, calm refugees down and help them in carriages, as well as help volunteers to load humanitarian aid at peaceful stations.
These are gas station attendants who patiently served frightened and nervous people on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war.
These are utility workers who take garbage out, repair water pipes and power lines under fire to provide necessary services to people.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything and volunteer in their spare time collecting first aid kits for the battlefront.
In Ukraine there is no juice when small leaves appear)
Please tell me, what age do you mean by little children?
My daughter is 8, is this age OK?
I am looking for an apartment for me and my daughter for 3–4 days to come to the Czech Republic and hand over my passports to receive visas to Canada.
There are a lot of people in the visa center in Warsaw, and the on-line queue doesn’t work.
I wanted to come for one day, but it’s far away, travelling by train takes a lot of time, it will be difficult for the child.
That’s why I decided to look for an apartment in Prague or nearby.
No, everything is fine with us
Where should I take the yesterday’s devices
But I can’t change my password when I click the link, as the following error occurs:
It’s in the microwave oven, something was burning there
In Ukraine, the operators of the largest banks are always in touch with customers 24 hours a day and promptly resolve all the issues :)

I am now on the phone with all my acquaintances from Lviv, many people have died.
In my opinion, the Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22.
By that time they put special stamps, and then these stamps were set equal to visas

I don’t need the money anymore, I borrowed it from a friend for a long time 😊
I wanted to say that I’ve already connected a Czech mobile number.
I didn’t need another device for this; I visited the O2 operator and they made for me an eSIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don’t need another device.
Thank you. It’s very inconvenient for me, I work for a week and can’t do anything anymore
You said your washing machine broke down. Take it for yourself. You need it very much too

The apples are very tasty, what variety is it?
Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said that Russia is launching a fake news operation concerning weapons supplied by Ukraine’s allies.
Mr. Yermak’s direct speech: “They understand that they are losing the war, they see that they are falling behind, and are attempting to disrupt weapons supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the claim that the S-300 air defense system supplied to Ukraine by Slovakia was destroyed.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the Russian scenarios. I’ll tell you about one of them.
They might launch fakes concerning Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrendering with weapons supplied by Ukraine’s allies, and the weapons being used to arm the Russian army.
I want to pre-empt such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are used exclusively to kill the enemy.
Excuse me, please, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost for a month and whether it will work in the summer?
Everyone gets what he or she can do.

Maybe your father told that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not practice any religion.
However I’m baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all the religions based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, I started reading the Torah.
I believe there are no mediators between man and God.
Also consider not putting a refrigerator near the door to the boys’ room.

Then I can’t help you. There are no options in Brno. The nearest house is in Perechyn
Thanks for your help, we found accommodation, but we need a bed and a sofa; maybe you could tell me where I can buy them cheap, because our budget is restricted, thank you very much

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after emergence of the evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports about Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops should be blamed,” Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand stated to reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia is accountable to the whole world for what they have done,” she added noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Fumio Kishida, Prime Minister of Japan, called the incidents a “violation of international law.”
These statements appeared upon occurrence of reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in Bucha, the suburb of Kyiv, by the Russian troops who had left the area after several weeks of occupation.
The photos that allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied shocked many people and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and prosecution of the guilty persons.
On April 4 Emmanuel Macron, President of France, told in a radio interview that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“The events in Bucha require a new round of sanctions and extremely clear measures,” Macron said adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at coal and oil export by Russia.
Pedro Sanchez, Prime Minister of Spain, said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do our best to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Mr. Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on the state television late on April 3, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, dismissed these accusations as a “provocation.”
Having no evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO had “ordered” these images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, I think the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after these materials had appeared, there is no doubt who had “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without any evidence that the images of Bucha was “another staging of the Kyiv regime” and that all the Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to convene on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4 the Russian Investigative Committee published a statement announcing an “investigation” for spreading “deliberately false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha by Ukraine.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, spoke on April 3 accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out,” Mr. Zelenskyy said in a video appeal switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is mutual responsibility.
For these murders and tortures… For shooting in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military must bear responsibility for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand that,” he commented the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2 a correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Svoboda allegedly saw bodies of civilians on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place the correspondent noticed up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Bucha.
The bodies of a group of nine people – all in civilian clothes – were scattered on the ground near the place that, according to local inhabitants, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims were likely appear to have been killed at close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the district of   Kyiv that had been controlled by Russian troops before last week.
Thank you, we have everything; we bought everything according to the list.
“They were told: there is no Kyiv.” How the occupiers meanly took the Ukrainian to Russian and Belarus
The Russian invasion into Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, raping, murders and tortures.
This list contains another item about which currently there is much less information – deportation of local inhabitants to the enemy’s territory.
Starting from around mid-March, the Russian occupiers “evacuate” the Ukrainians from temporarily occupied centers of population to their territory and the territory of Belarus that the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually handed over to use as a Russian military training area.
“Ukrainska Pravda” found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the “evacuation” itself is taking place and if there are any ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this article agreed to a 	voluntary-compulsory evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and because of hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, taking into account statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol the Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, took orphans from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zachepynsky.
The family of Oleksandr, Maryna and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
It was when Oleksandr got a job at the “Antonov” airport located 2.5 kilometers away from the town.
The family started living on the premises of a military town, though they were civilians.
Like true scouts Denys and Maryna packed their survival kits in advance, but did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses did not take any passengers anymore.
At about 12 o’clock on February 24 they noticed helicopters with the Latin letter V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went downstairs to the basement and remained there for three long weeks until March 17, till the Russian military deported them to Belarus.
In total about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not all the people decided to leave.
“At 6 pm on February 24 some people who spoke neither Russian, nor Ukrainian entered the house.
They asked: “Is anybody here?” – I said “yes”. – “Get out!”
They searched me and asked who was in the basement, and if there were any weapons there.
They interrogated all the men about if they had served in the army.
Women were told the following: “We’ve come to protect you, as Ramzan Kadyrov instructed.”
It was a Chechen special police squad, not even military troops, young men aged 25–35.
They said: “The Ukrainians helped us during the war, Sashko Bilyi (commander of the “Viking” detachment of the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war – “Ukrainska Pravda”), now we’ve come to help you.”
On the third day they asked what we were short of.
We said about water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke into a shop, took the goods from there explaining that “the Russians will still take everything away” and brought us 6 bottles of water.
There is also a video online where children thank Kadyrov for food.
Yes, they brought some sausages after looting a shop and said: “We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.”
Nobody wanted to talk a lot, but they made a beautiful footage.
Our child says there: “You have 7 days to give our phones back,” – they laughed at that.
They also constantly claimed that they were different from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want a war, they support the Ukrainians and are good in general: “Putin is a degenerate, and Kadyrov too, but there is nothing we can do, because our families are there.”
And mainly they did not fight, but were robbing shops and looting.
They took some chickens, tied a ribbon of Saint George to one leg, and their white sticky tape to the other, and called her “militia woman.”
They came to Ukraine without any training.
I don’t know how their reconnaissance parties worked… When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they didn’t even take the dead, they asked us: “Do you even have artillery?”
Moreover, there were consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether the people were their or the enemy’s fighters.
They stayed with us until March 13, after that the Russian special police squad arrived, followed by the Omsk landing party.
They put 30–40 units of equipment between the houses – our soldiers constantly hit them from “Bayraktars.”
But they came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exist, but there was the Azov Regiment with around 100,000 soldiers in Ukraine.
They have been constantly saying “Kyiv has already surrendered” since early March.
One day a Russian came to us – either a landing party officer or a representative of the Federal Security Service – and said that evacuation would be held.
And we listened to the radio – it said about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought that a “green corridor” might be provided for us.
From the very beginning we handed over our lists to the Chechens who promised to contact the Ukrainian military leaders.
But we were told: “You are being taken to Belarus, and then possibly to Rostov.”
We said that we didn’t want to go there.
But they answered: “Thing about mental health of your children!”
It worked this way: they drove us into the basement and started firing from under the house – with either “Grads” or mortars.
And then it flew back… Neighboring houses were just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit at the third floor in our house.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus and promised to hand us over to border guards and the Red Cross.
Some people did not go saying that it was for traitors of the homeland – they said that “you would be shot there and sold for organs.”
They were driving us through Chernobyl, there were sites of fire and broken vehicles on both sides of the road, though the Belarusians said that the Russians were taking the vehicles to them immediately.
There were a lot of caponniers, buried vehicles and soldiers.
At the Belarusian “Komar” checkpoint we passed an impromptu check, many people were without documents at all, because they were burned.
They placed us in the tents of the Red Cross and gave some tea.
And then we hear shots! A missile is launched, and a trace is visible – “Iskander” was launched at Kyiv.
Though people from the Belarusian Red Cross said: “No, these are planes flying and turning around at the border.”
But we work with aircrafts and have education, so we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the “Chonki” sanatorium near Gomel.
Its head, Vasyl Stepanovych Wenger, came and said: “I’m a Uke from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko won’t stop, until they kill those thieves of yours.
Poor people are suffering!
And our Lukashenko is so good!
Everything will be as he says.”
We were offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to do it.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: “You are already traitors!”
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations office (at least they called themselves so) were spreading misinformation that men could not go to Poland.
A lot of people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, though we had problems with documents – my daughter did not have a foreign travel passport.
We should have received it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the train station we were told that people without passports wouldn’t be taken in a bus.
I will say here that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
They lodged and escorted us in Minsk.
We were not forced to stay in the sanatorium.
The migration representative told our second group that they could live here for a week and at most, because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Passing Mazyr (about 50 kilometers away from the Ukrainian border – “Ukrainska Pravda”), we saw ballistic missiles launched at Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then dies out.
People who boarded a bus in Mazyr said that the Russians were constantly firing there from firing grounds.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals resign from the army.
One woman told us that she would injure her son if he was called up for military service.
However, in the northern part of Belarus where Minsk is located nobody believes this at all.
They say: “You are lying, we are a peaceful people.”
They do not believe that their firing grounds are used for shooting at Ukraine.
In Poland our friends were waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
Now we are passing registration and deciding what to do next.
Now there are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia, as there are Estonian ones.”
Maryna lived on the premises of a military town in Hostomel with her brother’s family – his wife and two children aged 18 and 22.
In the morning on February 24 she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of a neighboring house to spend the night.
Maryna herself could not return home and won’t be able to – there’s already no house.
Nobody really knew anything about evacuation.
Can you do it on Monday somewhere in the center?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you as guests!
Thank you for the agreement, the butterflies are beautiful
And in this small flat there’s no Wi-Fi coverage; mainly I answer all your questions, but now I don’t know what to do?! And the children have online classes from Monday, but there’s no Internet connection.
Do you mean I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this family ready to receive us?
The Koran says: “Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge.”
Our children study online; I am a saleswoman and cook, but I can also work in the field and as a charwoman, so I’m multifunctional; Maryana is an eyelash extensions professional, she can work at home; her friend doesn’t have any profession, he’s an odd-job man
Can we agree on how to do this in the best way?
On April 1 Anatoliy Fedoruk, the Mayor Bucha, announced good news: the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the invaders were expelled from the entire Kyiv Oblast.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on streets, some had their hands tied and were shot in the back of the head, some of the killed people were minors.
Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband Ihor and their son Oleksandr who were abducted on March 23 were found dead with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olha and Oleksandr were found in a mass grave, and the body of Igor was in the sewer.
The bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found near a highway 20 km from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them down.
And if I leave, no one will be at home
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
It was to be delivered yesterday, but no one contacted me and the parcel was not delivered, and the DHL website said that the recipient could not be found.
That’s why the parcel was sent to the post office, and the address of this branch was indicated.
How can I pick it up?
When I was little, I could also go to the river several times a day; the river is very close to the house, but now I rarely go there; I have no time and sometimes don’t want to, I go there only with my sister)🙂

She is very inattentive and somewhat irresponsible.
She would miss her stop or forget her phone, or she doesn’t pick up the phone as it’s happening now; and she didn’t write to me that she was at school and that everything was OK :)
And I worry about her, because, after all, she’s not at home, but in another, not yet quite familiar country

Archdiocesan Caritas Olomouc charitable organization wants to organize a project that will be interesting for the Ukrainians staying in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.
Imagine, the Russians rape women, and their children have to observe.
After that they can continue raping, mutilate the body, and the children see it all.
Hello, I’m talking to you in my mind – I need to learn the Czech language, but I can’t stop reading news.
I talk to you in my mind very often. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain weapons provided by Western partners were supplied too late.
He said this in an interview to the Associated Press, excerpts from which were published by the Presidential Office, the “European Pravda” writes.
“All the equipment, everything they are already sending, it was done too late for some types of the equipment.
So, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support of the leaders of some countries, that’s true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Mr. Zelenskyy said.
The President replied to the question about whether Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war as follows: “Not yet.”
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened or would be different.
“It would have turned out differently, we would be supported by our close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would be no war at all,” he added.
We remind that Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised some new military assistance to Ukraine, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war is over and I can return home
Please write to me about everything you need

Why do people flee?
Why don’t they live in an area where there is no war??
Are you off your head??
Have you lived in a belligerent state?
When prices increased by 100–200%.
When most enterprises DO NOT WORK.
When there are no jobs to earn money.
When children hear antiaircraft defense systems?
Have you ever lived like that?
You have no idea.
And I wish you haven’t.
And if you find out, it will be TERRIBLE.
That’s why we are fleeing.
Some of us are confused, with their phones… left from our previous lives… Yes, some people haven’t adapted during a month.

It will be written on her door, there’s the head of the department.
If you can’t agree, call Dominic, but I believe everything will go smoothly.
If Ms. Krzkowska is not there yet, wait a bit for her; she said that she has a meeting before that, it might take a while, but she knows about you and arranged to receive you at 9 o’clock, so that you have time to see a doctor.
Yes, of course, it would be great to spend time together

If so, then, for example, I’ll be able to work for several hours for a few days a week.

Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we did not go to the hospital.
A lady from Dáme jídlo has just called me and said that they had emailed me the information about further actions, and I haven’t not replied yet.

He was a very rich person, but he liked me, because I had my own point of view about life; I’d been dating him, then I left him.
He was a very rich man, after a while he called and said that he had undergone heart surgery.
He asked me just to talk and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought I might be his toy, and need his money.
And then he proposed to me

“I’m telling her that “repairing the TV and radio” has been delayed due to imported parts, and her friends and acquaintances have been warned not to talk too much when they call.”
“We keep the information about the war secret from my mother-in-law.
So far it works.
However, Plyamka (a cat – Ukrainska Pravda) has lost it fur on the belly and hind legs – it can be because of stress, different food and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but I can’t deal with the stress, unfortunately.
Plyamka, unlike my mother-in-law, is not deaf, she hears sirens and explosions.”
Due to the fact that Olha is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her “incognito” for a month.
And on April 1 93-year-old Oksana Polyova took weapons for the first time in her life.
“For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment like a guerrilla.
We kept secret the news about both the war and the fact that I was nearby – I formally came for a few hours, as usual.
But when her friend let out a secret, I gave the radio to her – she was listening to it for 4 hours, and then she was singing for 2 hours.”
The radio has always been near the bed.
My mother-in-law spends most of the time in her room.
She can’t hear well – it helped me to stay invisible.
If I heard the sound of her “walking aids,” I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the radio and TV from her.
Then I called everyone who talked to her. 6–7 people.
I asked to talk to her about anything but war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning till the end
Exactly on April 17 – I have to clean 2 flats :)
Good evening, I did not think about it at all :)
Hello, if you need our help tomorrow, we can come

I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation I’ll still be looking for it here.
I tell you there are embassies only here.
The Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and relatives that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Aiden Aslin, the Briton who served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, BBC citing family members and friends of Mr. Aslin, Atlas News citing the words of Aslin’s friend who spoke with him
Aslin’s twitter word-by-word: “We got some news from him: “It’s been 48 days, we tried our best to defend Mariupol but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces.
We have no food and no ammunition.
It’s been a pleasure everyone, I hope this war ends soon.”
Details: Mr. Aslin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine which is defending Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted Ann Wood, the mother of serviceman, and she confirmed that her son had said by phone that they were planning to surrender.
Brennan Phillips, a friend of the soldier, also confirmed to journalists that during a recent conversation by phone Aslin said about the plans of their unit to surrender.
He says that the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
The journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend who said that Aslin’s unit intended to surrender to Russian units, so as not to fall into the hands of the so-called “Kadyrov” detachments without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a phone conversation, in which Aslin allegedly speaks with an American friend of his who’s planning to go to Ukraine, was also shared in social networks.
During the conversation Aslin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but did not succeed.
Earlier the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by the representatives of the “Wagner” private military company.
Aslin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015–2017 he went to take part in fights against terrorists of the so-called “Islamic State” in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aslin’s friends and relatives called him Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Don’t mention it, I know it’s difficult for you. But I’d like to know too. Are we together or not?

And how much does it cost to rent a two-bedroom apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
The family is fine, I have a mother, three brothers and a husband left.
One brother fights in Mariupol, the other one is in Zaporizhya, and my husband has been transferred from Kyiv to Kharkiv today.
They call me every day and say that everything is fine, but those who know them won’t tell the truth anyway
I wanted to come to you, but I still needed to finish some business. When
I’ll ask my husband in the morning if he has time tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I need to talk with Daniil.
The Bolshevik invaders retaliated in full for their losses in the battle.
They shot dead teacher Dmytro Pavlytsky, an unknown relative of his, and a young man Borys Oleksienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a “deep cesspit which was filled up with earth.”
According to the memoirs, “there was dead silence in the city.”
Occasionally some residents used to run from house to house.
The bodies of people tortured by Bolsheviks were often found in the streets
And maybe I’ll really follow you. I need you. I can’t live without you.
3. How would your activities help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won’t get there, because the railway is being reconstructed and the entrance is closed.
When you get to the bridge being reconstructed, please tell me that you have arrived, and I’ll come to you
The best future is waiting for us
Lena, should I return the stuff that did not fit us because of the size to you or to Katya?
Yes, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night.
I just wake up very early in the morning without an alarm clock.
I sleep for 4–5 hours so far, but it’s good that I sleep at all.
Marina couldn’t wake me up today when they arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass
If I got it right, we will be sent an entry letter from the school to order the menu
OK, we’ll try to take it from the social service on Tuesday
Then, after the filling has cooled down and the dough is ready, form the cakes and fry them on low heat in oil.
Well, I’ll ask him for sure.
As soon as we settle in tomorrow night, I’ll call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to show my gratitude to everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, really.
I’m not afraid of working, as I also lived in a village, so I can work physically and love it.
When can I bring the things to you
You have a very interesting tradition, we do that on Christmas too
Last week the Verkhovna Rada passed Bill 7176 “On Monitoring Potential Threats to National Security of Ukraine in the Economic Sphere.”
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere was… the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill think that decision-making by a supervisory board of a state-owned company in Kyiv, for example, can somehow solve national security problems of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new hazards for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any companies that need to hold meetings of a supervisory board at the location address.
A potential threat caused by such a law is clear: it is an excellent basis for “elimination” of all the gains of a difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, followed by establishing manual control.
The control that was in place by 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should constitute them?
Besides, if one harmful bill with patriotic slogans is implemented, others may appear tomorrow – for example, it is possible to eliminate the public procurement system through the ProZorro system or independence of the National Bank of Ukraine.
A lot of things may be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative emerged before the war and Bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22 this regulation was included in the comparative table of Bill 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some elected representatives for a long time.
Let us analyze the arguments that were used to explain the need for adoption of this bill not for the sake of criticism alone, but in order to show its possible consequences.
After that let us provide our suggestions about solving the issue of state-owned enterprises management during the war.
Denys Kudin, the First Deputy Minister of Economy, explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other communication facilities, which will make remote functioning of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that a supervisory board will not be able to make necessary decisions, which could paralyze operations of a company.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will it be possible to eliminate it by moving supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let us imagine rather a cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of them) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case they can be fired in accordance with the Bill.
Most likely, after that it will lead to the loss of quorum required for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, because the law requires competitive selection that takes 3–4 months at the average.
Thus, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent losing the opportunity to make decisions by the supervisory board, but rather will lead to it!
Dmytro Natalukha, People’s Deputy and author of the Bill, provides other arguments in its favor.
Particular, he notes the following: “many companies, including the ones belonging to the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation” and therefore “it is difficult to imagine that a person from Vienna can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom.”
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned MIC enterprises with supervisory boards.
The supervisory board is only in the State Concern “Ukroboronprom,” which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the MIC.
But even in the State Concern “Ukroboronprom,” in accordance with the law, the supervisory board has very limited authorities, and all its members perform their duties on a grant basis.
All the plenary authority in the “Ukroboronrom” belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will make decisions concerning the need to relocate certain MIC enterprises that constitute this concern.
Besides, such an argument is beneath criticism, because Bill 7176 does not amend the legislation governing the activities of MIC state-owned enterprises.
Mr. Natalukha on his Facebook page also provides arguments that can be classified as “emotional” ones.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and banks, but let us try to analyze some of them: “after hearing the word “war” for the first time respectable foreign experts leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of supervisory boards of Ukrainian state-owned enterprises with full salaries of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war.”
Firstly, it is a manipulation – most of such members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only came here from time to time.
Thus, to put it mildly, it is unfair to say that they “leave Ukraine.”
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have been holding online meetings for a long time.
This tool has been long used throughout the world in completely different areas: business, education, medicine etc.
We also should not forget that membership in a supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other jobs, and it is electronic means of communication that help them with this.
Thirdly, all these statements sound like claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Natalukha does not make identical claims against Ukrainian members of supervisory boards?
As they do not stay at the addresses of their companies too.
By the way, it is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovarsky, Vyshhorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region that has been liberated from the occupiers an intensified curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Direct speech of Mr. Pavlyuk: “In the centers of population in Brovarsky, Vyshhorodsky and Buchansky districts that were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces the curfew has been intensified!
In these towns and villages the restrictions will apply from 9 pm on April 2 to 6 am on April 5.”
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of centers of population and other public places, as well as to move by transport and on foot.
Inhabitants can go outside only during the alarm to hide in a shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear the premises of mines and other objects.
Mr. Omelyanyuk appealed to the people who have left these districts to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region the curfew will last daily from 9 pm to 6 am.
No, I haven’t sent anything from school yet, I only have a receipt about payment

There is a word-for-word translation of that document in Czech.
I only added an explanation of inkaso below.
I already have an account. I’ve opened it in another bank. As I needed it for my job.
Serbia’s defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to the 22nd place in the list of the world’s most powerful military states.
Upon the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine it means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.
if you don’t mind, I would come
Yes, we’ve registered, but it is difficult for us; we live in a hostel, and it’s not very convenient for my son. I’d like to live in a village.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime arrested three Belarusians aged 27 and 28, involved in destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal location near Osipovichi that ensures movement of railway trains.
Source: “Radio Svaboda,” “Viasna” Human Rights Center, Gennady Kazakevich, head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, cited by the “BelTA” state news agency
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30 three residents of Bobruisk were arrested and one was wounded with the support of SOBR special forces.
The “Viasna” center reports that during the arrest the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the arrested people was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others received medical care on-site.
Gennady Kazakevich, head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, stated that “acts of terrorism on the Belarusian railways will be severely stopped” by security forces with weapons.
On April 6 it became known that on March 30 the police arrested another employee of the Belarusian Railways, Valentyn Samasyuk, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the Belarusian Railways, and the administrator of the Belarusian Railways thematic resources at VKontakte and Odnoklassniki.
@belzhd_live reports that there’s no information about his current location and state.
In late March at least 40 railway workers were arrested in Belarus for acts of sabotage.
Let us remind: The BYpol formation, declared an extremist one by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out acts of sabotage on railways and infrastructure facilities in Belarus within the “Victory” plan.
Belarusian “rail guerrillas” try to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
As you know, the Russian Federation is sending manpower and equipment to Ukraine through Belarus to fight.

Temporarily we are looking for a university, then of course we will need permanent accommodation,
but maybe she’ll get a room in a dorm. (We are looking for the one in Prague, Brno, and other places)
Now we are not far from Prague, we have a car and want to partly pay for accommodation.
It doesn’t matter where (a city or village), but we prefer a separate apartment.
I pressed something in Vodafone and connected two unnecessary promotions for which some money was withdrawn, and I can’t turn them off 😭
And money was withdrawn from a card without any funds
And I don’t understand why the money was withdrawn
The cost of repairs is paid by the owner = Mr. Dedina. He has to come on Tuesday.
Be home on Tuesday and wait for the repairmen.
Can I ask you for one cigarette?
Can we change the mobile plan if you have time? Or is it late?
The USA are banning investments in Russia and imposing sanctions on Putin’s daughters
The United States together with the G7 and the EU is imposing new sanctions on the daughters of President of the Russian Federation Putin, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
It’s reported in the statement on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any assets of theirs related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens to do business with them.
Besides, the United States will introduce a total ban of new investments in Russia.
For this purpose US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban of new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
“This action builds on the decision made by more than 600 multinational businesses to exit from Russia.
The exodus of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms”, – the statement of the White House says.
The third step of the new US sanctions consisted in restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens to conduct transactions with these organizations and will freeze any assets of theirs under US jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will release a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is complete blocking the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, and members of the Security Council of Russia, including former Russian President Prime Minister and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions shut them down from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they own in the United States.
You will be able to get only to this place, after that the passage is closed, and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the machine already?
My name is Olha, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp; my mother was a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to the kindergarten.
Our life was beautiful, and we didn’t even think that we would have to flee, because we no longer have the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that for the beginning someone will give us a shelter) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but if we can afford it.
We guarantee that it will be clean and in proper order.
We do not have bad habits.
We will be grateful for help in such hard times for us.
I had an English lecture in the afternoon, and after that I went to work in the nursery.
There I explained to Marharyta how to complete all the documents.

She brought an announcement from the pool.

We’ll do it somehow.
But when it is paid, please take no loans.
Write to me directly, and I will help.
We are either partners or not.

Something came from you, I don’t see what
I also feel very sad
I’ll remind you about the invoice later
Does only your father speak and understand Russian?
What day does a colleague want to clean the house, and how many windows are in the house?
I’m sorry to distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I cannot help but share it with you. There are news from Mariupol about the son – he’s alive and on duty.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he conducts scientific experiments about the influence of external factors and formation of new neural connections
On April 12 in the morning Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, shared a video handed to her by the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In this video the military say they have no weapons left to combat, and lots of soldiers are wounded.
They said that “it’s the matter of several hours.”
Earlier on April 11 the 36th Separate Marine Brigade which defends Mariupol published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The appeal stated that April 11 can be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol and the Ukrainian military leaders did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks people expressed some skepticism about publishing the statement in Russian.
Valeriy Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, assured that the leaders keep in touch with the defense forces in Mariupol and the details of the defense operation should not be discussed in public.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters at the premises of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On April 11 in the evening the Russian invaders dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin in Mariupol.
Andriy Biletsky, the leader of the Azov Regiment, reported that the army of the Russian Federation used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant which is held by the Azov Regiment fighters.
Thank you, I’ll adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation hasn’t changed, so far we’re staying here
2 hours drive)) walks, shopping by mom and back)!
That’s not an important matter
She forgot what she was going to do here
A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine today.
Nearly 50 professional helicopters🚁 will be used to detect, and some of them to directly destroy the enemy invaders💥.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech “birds” were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to Volodymyr Labutenko, a deputy of the Mukachevo City Council.
Today their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their destination: special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently underway received them.
In order to use helicopters as efficiently and safely as possible, their locations will be kept secret for now.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say that soon many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine that will destroy Russian occupiers and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don’t worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without it
I worry that we won’t be in time. Lots of luggage.
I’m coming back to Ukraine soon to continue working
Fine. If everything goes well, I’ll agree to this
I’ll try to do it myself, but if I have problems, can I write to you?
The main thing is that we understand each other
We personally visited a woman, the elder of the village of Yivov, she saw me and noticed that I was pregnant, but told that there was no place to live
Maybe she’ll be happy and in better mood
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think that I was frozen stiff on the street today.
I took medicine and tea; I feel worse, but not critical.
I’m also sorry, but it’s better to meet when I’m healthy.
When you have time, share the music you like with me.
I wonder what music you like 😊
you need to obey your mom and dad
You’ll find him somewhere near your little brother’s carriage.
Today it was colder and rainy It should be warm tomorrow.
But I don’t feel sorry for destroyed houses, I feel sorry for people humiliated by invaders
In Kherson the occupiers humiliated the “Glory of Ukraine” memorial on the Perekopska Street.
Details: It is reported that unknown people tore down the flag of the European Union, crushed the panels with the photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed during the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down the portraits of the Heavenly Hundred heroes and the late participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag has been torn down.
Good morning, children, thank you for the carol; we do not have such a custom, so we did not know about it and gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe we should have given something else
Just in case: some people speak Czech
Because I live in a kind of a dorm; there will be people here by twelve o’clock, and then they’re going to work

As for May, I can say approximately in late April or early May.

The headquarters’ summary: Russia prepares provocation in Prydnistrovia in order to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army might carry out provocations in the Prydnistrovia region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring country.”
Verbatim: “We cannot rule out the possibility that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation will carry out a provocation on the territory of the Prydnistrovia region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring country.”
Details: The enemy continues gathering forces to launch an offensive on the Slobozhanskyi front.
It is likely that the occupying forces will attempt to resume the offensive in the coming days.
Besides, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons, and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the site where the 60th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th All-Military Army of the Eastern Military District is permanently deployed.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Recruitment of soldiers to recover the losses of the battalion tactical group from the 36th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade (Borzya, Transbaikalia region) of the 29th All-Military Army of the Eastern Military District is also taking place.
The Russian army is particularly struggling to recruit drivers and driver-mechanics.
The personnel selected are scheduled to be moved away from where they are permanently deployed in the second half of April.
The enemy will likely continue targeting transportation infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine, in order to destroy it or render it unusable and therefore disrupt the supply of goods to the area of active hostilities.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhanskyi front, separate units of the 6th All-Army and Coastal Troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially blockade the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of some parts of the city continues.
Russian troops carry out aerial reconnaissance on the Izyum front in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The enemy is using Orlan-10 UAVs for this.
Two Russian army battalion tactical groups attempted to launch an offensive on the towns of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, but were unsuccessful and had to retreat to their former positions.
On the Donetsk front, Russian troops continue to focus on seizing control of the cities of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhnie, and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to storm the town of Zolote, but were unsuccessful.
In Mariupol, Russian occupying forces continue to storm the Azovstal plant and the Mariupol seaport with the help of artillery and aircraft.
Separate Russian troops carried out artillery shelling of Ukrainian troops’ positions near the towns of Vysokopillia, Trudoliubivka, and Marianske.
Over the last 24 hours, Ukraine’s defenders have repulsed four enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six units of automotive equipment, and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn’t she understand your thoughts?
Of course, we will try to make it in time, but I doubt it
And you probably want to sleep, and I’m holding you back
Do you really not mind my visit?
Maybe you just don’t want to see me today, then please tell me, I’ll understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home, especially the 1+1 channel. You don’t have to tune it up for us :)
I turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
Today my monthly plan expires :)
Can we do it today by phone?
Buy fabric and threads for embroidery, as well as canvas
I understand, then I can prepare the materials in this area.
I’ll ask her. I’m a little shy to ask, she gives us so many pies in any case.
We’ll meet with my father later, for sure 🙏🏻
I read an announcement on Facebook, maybe Google wrote something in its own way🏵️. I think the phone number is enough
Hello, we took the things you brought, but some of them are too small for us; can we bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If it’s OK with the director, I can start working next week, because tomorrow before lunch I’m planning to go to the labor office to submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues), and on Saturday it’ll rain :)
I’m looking for a team for the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I’m studying Czech to speak it perfectly, and I dream of working for Teva
Very old friends, more recent ones, the ones I do not know personally, friends of the spirit and the mind.
Times are hard for you too right now.
I have been communicating with many of you, over the past month.
Like the lives of every single Ukrainian, yours, never simple, are being completely overturned.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have expressed to me feelings of guilt, of shame, over what your country is doing to your neighbor.
Over what is being done to Ukraine in your name.
Some of you, the activists, have been under the hammer for a long time, and have been bracing for the final stroke.
In early March I wrote to Aleksandr Cherkasov, a very old friend from Memorial.
“I’ll tell you a bit later,” answered Sasha in his usual laconic tone. – “Right now after the search we are wandering through ruins”.
Others amongst you, cultural figures, artists, critics, writers, are stunned by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let us be honest: except for very few of you – those working with Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Meduza, Navalny’s organization and a handful of others – how many of you ever did anything to resist that regime?
Except for joining the demonstrations, when there were any.
Please also read the column of the Russian journalist “Too late to hide, too late to remain silent”
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstract?
Could they also be due to your own apathy, your long indifference to what was happening around you, and your passive complicity, which you must feel now in your bones and in your soul?
It wasn’t always like this.
For a while, back in the 1990s, you had a measure of freedom and democracy, messy, bloody even, but real.
Yet 1991 turned out like 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have your revolution, you end up so afraid of the time of troubles that you run straight back under the skirts of a Tsar, whether his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many he kills, it seems safer to you, somehow. Why is that?
True, mistakes were made.
Instead of raiding the KGB archives and exposing them to the light of day, like the Germans did with the Stasi, you let yourselves be distracted by Dzherzinsky’s statue, and allowed the KGB to lie low, regroup, rebuild, and take over your country.
When you were offered a choice between the looting of the country or the return of the Communists, you didn’t fight to impose a third choice, and acquiesced to the looting.
In 1998 your economy collapsed, and that was pretty much the end of mass demonstrations for more social justice, or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival became the main concern.
Then they brought in Putin. Young, bold, aggressive, promising destruction to the terrorists and an economic turnaround.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for him, or didn’t vote at all.
And when he started levelling Chechnya for the second time, most of you closed your eyes and turned your back.
I remember those years very well.
I was working down in Chechnya, providing aid to the innumerable victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation,” travelling through the ruins of Groznyi and Katyr-Yurt and Itum-Kale and so many other towns.
Sometimes, I came back to Moscow for a break and I partied with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and then I would try to tell you about the horrors I was seeing down there, the tortured civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers selling back the bodies of the dead to their families.
And you would say to me: “Brad, we’re fed up with your Chechnya.” I remember those words very well.
And I would rage at you: “Guys, it’s not my Chechnya, it’s your Chechnya.
Damn it, it’s your country, not mine.
I’m just a stupid foreigner here.
It’s your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was too complicated, too painful, you didn’t want to know.
Then came the great economic boom of the mid-2000s, fueled by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to allow some of the stolen money to cascade down to the middle class.
Many of you made money, some of you lots of it, and even the poorer ones among you got new apartments and better jobs.
Prices rose but that was alright.
Moscow was aglow, glittery, chic, fun.
When opponents were murdered – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaïa, Aleksandr Litvinenko, and others – you expressed horror and shock.
But it hardly went further.
When Putin, after two terms, handed the presidency to his prime minister and took his seat, you barely noticed, as far as I could tell.
When Russia, a few months into Medvedev’s presidency, invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it, or stayed quiet.
And for years after, how many of you did I run into on the ski slopes of Gudauri, hiking around Kazbegi, or enjoying the cafés and steam baths of Tbilisi while your army occupied part of the country?
Not that we, here in the West, did much either, if anything.
A few complaints, a few sanctions; but what were egregious violations of international law in comparison to the lure of Russia’s oil, gas and internal market?
It was fine to live in Russia.
And it was the most important thing after the difficult 1990s.
At the end of 2011, though, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.
When Putin switched seats with Medvedev again, putting himself right back into the president’s chair, many of you decided that was one dirty trick too many, and you came out en masse to protest.
Navalny became a household name and for six months you filled the squares, finally putting fear into the regime, rocking it on its heels.
Then it struck back.
First it organized counter-protests; then it passed more repressive laws, and started filling up its jails.
Thousands were arrested.
Some got very long sentences.
“What could we have done?”
I heard this so often, and still hear it now.
“The State is so strong, and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Once they occupied Maidan, in their rage at a pro-Russian president who had betrayed his promise of more Europe, they never left it.
hey formed a tent city, entirely self-organized, and willing to defend itself.
When the police came to try and break it up, they fought back, with sticks and iron bars and Molotov cocktails.
At the end, the police opened fire.
But instead of running, the protesters charged.
Many of them died, but they won.
It was Yanukovych who ran, and the Ukrainians got their democracy back, their right to choose their leaders and throw them out when they don’t do the job.
Putin really didn’t like Maidan.
It was a bad example.
So he grabbed Crimea while everyone was still off-balance.
Some few of you also protested that, but to no avail.
So many were enthused!
91% of Russians approved the annexation, I believe.
Suddenly there was a new myth, and some of you who had despised Putin and his clique suddenly turned around and worshipped him.
I don’t know why, as we quickly stopped talking after that.
As for the others, those of you who remained my friends, you mainly stayed silent.
“I’m not interested in politics,” you would say.
And you would go back to literature, or films, or IKEA catalogues, or enjoying the brand-new parks the mayor of Moscow had been seeding the city with since 2012, with their bean bags and free Wi-Fi and hipster cafés.
Yes, Donbass was far, and Moscow was cool, and getting cooler still.
You barely even noticed Syria.
Anyhow they were all terrorists, right?
Daesh or whatever… Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria then criticized it in an interview, saying I understood nothing about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I had been there, watching children the age of my own being shot in cold blood by regime snipers in the streets of Homs.
The only Russians that went there were your army, who, in 2015, started bombing thousands of civilians and practicing for their next serious war.
Many of you, I am sure, know the famous words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:
“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out – because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me – and there was no one left to speak for me.”
How many of you spoke out for the Chechens, the Syrians, or the Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But far too many were silent.
Some, it is true, are speaking out now, people like Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maksim Osipov, others too.
Most speak from outside the country, a rare few from inside, like Marina Ovsyannikova, taking the risk of being sent to join Navalny in his Gulag.
As for the rest of you, you understand what country you live in, better than most.
And so I’m sure you understand this: when Putin is done with the Ukrainians – but even more so if he is unable, as looks likely, to finish them off – he will come for you.
or all of you, my friends: for those who have courageously but mostly individually gone out to protest, and for now have gotten only light sentences, but soon will get much stiffer ones.
For the thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed your disapproval on social networks (maybe only with a black square on Instagram), or who have spoken out in private to your colleagues at work.
The days when one got 10 years of deprivation of liberty for a joke, or even 25, are not that far in the past, and now they are also in your future, most likely.
And who then will speak out for you? Who will be left?
The Ukrainians, now even more than in 2014, are setting a terrifying example for Putin’s regime: they are showing that he can be fought.
And that if one is clever, and motivated, and courageous, he can even be stopped, no matter what his overwhelming superiority on paper.
Of course, nearly no one in Russia is aware of this, apparently, or even that there is a war on.
But you, my friends, know what is happening.
You read the foreign news on the internet, you all have friends or even relatives in Ukraine whom you message.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be careful.
You know where this is heading.
The days of the good life in return for your silence are over now.
Your elections are a joke, your laws, except for the repressive ones, aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, your last free media is gone, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write, you no longer even have credit cards to buy a plane ticket out, if there are flights left.
Now Putin won’t just want your silence, he will want your acquiescence, your complicity.
And if you won’t give it him what it he wants, you can either try to leave, somehow, or be crushed.
I doubt you see any other choice.
Yet there is one.
Which is finally to topple this regime.
It probably would take less than you think, in the current situation.
Think about it.
The spark won’t come from you: with the economic collapse that is about to hit Russia, it will most likely come from the provinces, from the lesser cities.
There, when prices soar and salaries are no longer paid, all those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out onto the streets.
Putin knows this, and he fears them far more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg – you, my dear friends.
But if each city demonstrates on its own, as already has occasionally happened, it will not be difficult for him to move and suppress them.
Things will need to be organized and coordinated. The mob will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this magnificent and magic tool called the internet, which the regime can hinder, but which can be made to work regardless of almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been dismantled, but others can be formed, more informal ones, more decentralized.
You are very numerous, you are millions.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people in the street, maybe a hundred thousand.
More than 300 thousand, they would be overwhelmed.
They would have to call in the army, but would this army fight for Putin, when it came down to it?
After what he has made them do in Ukraine, what he has done to them?
There will be terrible danger, of course.
Some of you will be afraid, and those of you with children will be terrified of something happening to them.
This is natural and normal.
In your place, I would be afraid too.
In Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin sought to show you, by example, what happens to a people who dare to defy their master, who dare not only to ask for freedom but actually to try and take it.
Yet if you do nothing, so many lives will be lost in vain.
One of your sons will make a joke on a video game chat, and will be arrested; one of your daughters will express her indignation on internet and will be arrested; a dear friend of yours will make a mistake and will die in a dank cell under the sticks of the police.
This is what has been happening for years now, and is what will continue to happen, on a greater and greater scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Be smart, be strategic, and find a way to make it happen.
We attended the class on Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday
We’ll be home in the evening
That you perceive me as a press secretary
Vika, how often do you dine in expensive restaurants?
Once a month I have dinner in an expensive restaurant

Yes, we liked it; it’s very nice, and we’d like something closer, so this is the best option
I was in a room with a lot of people. I’ve lost all my energy.
I feel bad, coughing, fever, my voice has disappeared, weakness and dizziness
I have to go to that labor class

While working in the prosecutor’s office, I thought I was building my career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had difficult psychological, responsible, mental work which I was completely disappointed in.
I’m sorry for the time lost, but it is life experience.
As for my personal life, I am sociable, but I am monogamous and take marriage issues quite seriously.
There was a man I was going to get married with, but he died because of heart problems.
I believe that in order to build a family, people should love, respect and trust each other.
I have not met such a person so far.

Mr. Reichard, sorry for bothering you during non-business hours.
But I have an important question to you.
I went to Natalie’s playroom today to say hello.
She got into an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to pick up her child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with the clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children’s room to her yesterday until 7 pm.
Can this really happen?
The room work till 4 pm.
And after all, it is our responsibility.
