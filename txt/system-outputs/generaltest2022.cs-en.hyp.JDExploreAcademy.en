The great comeback of the Czech underdog is approaching.
Pavel Francouz called up to NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon find himself in goal.
The former goalie of Litvínov, Pilsen or the Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was substituted in the middle of the game against Vegas and has not appeared in an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, US time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The graduate of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year and didn't play a single game in the pandemic-shortened season.
In the NHL, "Francík" has played 36 games, and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles masks up Camilla for Christmas card as William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wishes public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camilla to put on a face mask at the races.
The British news broadcaster BBC reported this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, as is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk for a Christmas card photo.
The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, have also published a picture that will serve as a Christmas card.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and face mask, helps Camilla put on her mask, which is colour-coordinated with her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied this.
Prague - Detectives in the current corruption case allegedly worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz reported on this, saying that it had gained access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-and-whites did not commit any corrupt practices.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
According to the file, the former influential functionary of the red-and-whites was in frequent contact with both Berbra and the former sports director of the then second-division Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The detectives were reportedly working with information that Slavia had promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the first league title.
The police had information that Roman (Berbr) had been promised a million-dollar bribe by officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal actions, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by a police operation in several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, in mid-October last year.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping the cold war.
The cannons will be new, but basically inferior (gunners have to carry the cartridges manually, without cover, from an armoured cabin).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already been possible to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting ground just outside the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course, after a while, the fox came.
I let it come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a trick.
By the time I got down from my perch, it was gone.
I.e. even a meadow can be prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So put your valuables in a visible place at your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Ministry of the Interior procured respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for professions most affected by the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their purchase in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for a respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the ČSLA, which the older generation experienced), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that could be used by the trained, we don't actually have modern equipment even for the current professionals, moreover, modern technology is more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-train someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be waged in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography.
We just don't have the individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
This then leads to a situation where you look like a dude who missed an empty net two minutes ago, driving into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss players, and you say to yourself "wow, and what do you think will happen now?."
Well, of course they're going to recruit him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "tackle the defender" skill is so terrible that I found myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker was able to beat one of the opposing players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will continue for some time and, as is known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity gained from previous experience of the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected silver lining entered the COVID equation this week: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovide from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape in the first place also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in these studies is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown."
See, you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist animals.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and a media lynching.
Then it looks good in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France that Le Pen and Zemmour, according to the poll, both have over 20%.
We even know that there are three completely identical buildings in the Czech Republic.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to learn where everything is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether for reasons of security or the speed of deployment of warheads due to its more westerly location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire missiles, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some kind of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a dilapidated state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, and we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he came often and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or telephones, he came cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in the countryside, he did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully he never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, gypsies, started in the same grade, different class.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to trick me with the price, communication was easy.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself.
I say of myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves as he should in a decent society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But if someone comes, stretches out a hand, inhabits flats and houses, has nothing but a mess around them, causes problems... then it doesn't matter what colour they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons that have not yet been established, drove into oncoming traffic on a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where post is often free," says the collector.
Since October, it has become slightly more expensive for him to order small consignments, he now has to add VAT and submit data to the post office for customs clearance.
He gets an e-mail saying that customs is expecting a package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of incoming mail from abroad at the international post office in Prague has fallen from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Tackling inflation
According to the headline, how would you suggest dealing with the current inflation?
Inflation is currently at 9.9% and is expected to rise further.
In your opinion, what should the state do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
In Poland, for example, we are seeing a reduction in VAT on food and fuel, is this the way forward for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable about where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get as a bonus (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% to my gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while I am employed.
Can someone explain to me why proven rapists are only sent to prison for six months?
It just boggles my mind how a court can send an animal like this to prison for only 6 months, only for him to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victims from reporting?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob unintentionally helped officers to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had called them to her.
But he did it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In reality, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
After checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we have not been Slavs ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague for the USA:')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
Even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
In such a case, would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of the thousands of gods and having the one true god, whom I just missed, send me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the Czech Army could do with something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
Let's put it this way: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and a kind of intermingling is taking place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or Mongolian invader will ever invade here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if the shit hits the fan.
Well, bless her heart.
All it takes is one election in the US to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they have to do is turn their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled vehicle, no matter what.
We don't need border fortifications, that's nothing these days, but a pimply teenager behind the knob of a remote-controlled device can manage.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You unwrap the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home inundated with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Upon agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, since the price of packaging cardboard has risen by 50% in the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filler material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of cartons.
We will use everything to pack shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tyres, used electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste are gradually increasing," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Rather, I find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app, or indeed mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem and folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend - it starts in January - and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, in the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in half a year.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, who straddle the right and the left, agree on little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be a new presidential election in April.
The electoral calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't they be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress Jasna Duričová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was at the top of the audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins won best actor in Berlin for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than the regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I don't claim that everyone feels this way)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary supplement.
It will also include cultural tips.
For you, the subscribers, we are adding the books to this digital edition, so that you have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.

The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a longed-for illusion.
The bohemian and comparative artist transfers the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the setting of a contemporary village.

In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it worth living together.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the time of departure will be adjusted, or their route will be slightly adjusted.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets in the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections daily, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also include services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Along with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
After its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will be replaced by Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářík, the carrier has also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible, despite the planned closure works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Ceskolip region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single railway fare.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and how they had to work and die.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
They don't even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, killed them, while they were killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I won't deny that (in Japan, for example, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, when it comes to the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and they didn't like a lot of things either.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and what's more, our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT from a television where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalised and the schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalised.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always comes out with some bullshit about the coronavirus that makes everyone feel ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to services with the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there, every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., they celebrate Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna to pick him up this time either. In the morning, they picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
It was also accepted at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouts travel to Vienna by train.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light on Saturday, 18 December, travelling on selected fast trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, so that they wear masks, try to keep their distance, there are as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, of light overcoming darkness.
In the Czech Republic, boy and girl scouts have been promoting it for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being spent on agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company."
I myself work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply kept alive artificially.
This is not supporting a company that employs x number of people, this is hindering development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes, even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm swayed by internet ads, but then I catch myself being influenced by them anyway - it's just so contrived that you can't always avoid it.
This is another reason why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of a classic - I'd ban the internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'll claim to be cryptic thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will premiere a record number of more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more festive films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales in particular are associated with this period, and the films Home Alone, Love Actually and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom in Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning in its viewers for Christmas on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival network Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, what matters is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel, for two hours at least, a little bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which of course is resolved and they kiss.
It's like this all over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, will not take part in final F1 race
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will therefore appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher starting from the last place and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively well and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all concerned," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any replacement would have to qualify or drive in a different part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not encounter COVID-19.
At the start of the season just ending, Kimi Raikkonen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can get arrested for that, too.
And no one will care what the boss said.
From a legal point of view, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.

(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two years to eight years,
c) if by such act he violates an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious bodily harm.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three years to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious bodily injury to at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater astounds!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters were never worn a lot," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over the course of six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France, and the company Swarowski supplied 2,000 decorative crystals.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be put to better use, but that's a whole other discussion.

The government has approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been going on for several months, inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms and four have no symptoms.
No one suspected of being Omikron has travelled abroad
None of them have travelled abroad, nor have any of their families, and there has been no contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienist, Pavla Svrčinová, said earlier that an international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after an embryo's heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to recover damages from anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Texas' ban on abortion, even though it went against nearly 50 years of precedent that established a right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He said he had instructed his staff to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is the name given to home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, when the vaccination schedule is gradually worked out and the vaccines themselves are improved on the basis of the results.
Israel, for example, is already rolling out a large-scale study on the effects of the fourth dose.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market soon.

Poland has threatened to stop paying into the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting illegally if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from an EU fund to rebuild economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And she is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified by the fact that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish judiciary during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is creating "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political diktat carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
But to get to the bottom of it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I met one yoghurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I can avoid it, I won't go to any market, event or no event, the gold shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I couldn't care less.
For two years I've been watching how data is treated like manure here, most anti-vaxxers are just a little more out of touch than most pro-vaxxers.
Although a rational discussion is taking place at the expert level, only extreme opinions are getting into the public space.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But no one is addressing the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states.
Phew, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
When I was a child, I was punished with boiling water.
It was never about grades, it was mostly about me repeatedly refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a punch (sometimes, even after another "catch," she just brought the spoon and put it where I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a couple of blows to my buttocks (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and be punished, or to improve and not be punished.
In the end, I usually only needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document, to which one swears an oath and which has been taught in school since time immemorial, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we have agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
At the time, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question in the same way that Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage.
Recently, however, lawyers are increasingly of the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, for example, the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, a constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians down with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to wield their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate, they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby at the Brno University Hospital
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course tends to be much simpler, easier, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place in a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Only recently have very seriously ill children with coronavirus been admitted to the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-Covid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults, but also adolescents and babies of a few months.
There are also children in hospitals in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"We currently have a child several months old and an adolescent," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the children's hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part of the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination also alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-Covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccination dose for children as well," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest areas aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in the national parks outside the quiet zone (but do not climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You are not allowed to ski/cycle in the forest off the marked trails unless you have a special permit (but of course this is not so strictly enforced outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He grew up with the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically the entire repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Salda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
It cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China creates the impression of a controlled contagion and that an authoritarian regime is better able to face the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was fending off criticism that it had failed to stop the disease from turning into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
His wife is happy because he grazes the grass, washes the car with his trunk and the children play with him.
It's just great.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: let's high-five, that'll be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for, an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car is falling apart, the children are fighting over it and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you're talking badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World events are dominated by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, it has been working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.
I thought of that, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces," i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and does not need to be further specified for American forces.
But then again, maybe I'm just playing with words:D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it away and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
She has now been banned from keeping animals for life at Gwent Magistrates' Court, The Sun reports.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who have been caring for Milly since her ordeal said they had never seen a marmoset so distressed.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily back playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay court costs of 12,000 crowns.
Small Monkeys rehoming team leader Steph Sawyer said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will go on."
It took time for Milly to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement caused her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she is settled and happy with a male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The mental scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent Police discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after raiding her flat on drugs charges.
Milly can be heard swearing profanely in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "You want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden in Kinder eggs at her home.
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row, if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you get the same things in first grade that you got in sixth grade?
And it's all killed by the idea of cramming, when nobody, with honourable exceptions, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
The main thing is to write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can identify the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the vast majority don't give a shit and will tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck are they studying for?
I'm a big fan of universal background checks, and the reality is that people don't want them and they don't need them.
And at that point, it's pointless and you're never going to get it in them anyway.
They learn it partly for the many people who will need this or that thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all that when you're standing at the machine, I meant that completely seriously... ...because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(In which our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elites probably play a part) However, the price of having barbarians standing at these machines is simply too high.
If journalists knew how to count, Covid would probably never have reached such proportions here.
Married at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the inquisitive questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Kadri and Andrea have been at loggerheads since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! was Kadri's angry response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Even his younger sister Linda did not like the alleged honesty of Kadri's now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in my family, we never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for putting on a brave face and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, reads the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole the equivalent of just under 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
He is then seen on one of the security cameras walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
It subsequently detained Cao.
The man admitted that he had drunk some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's council elections in four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have been dissolved.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, said the vice-chairwoman of the CSO, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, gaining 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Private Citizens, was again elected to the council on their behalf.
Komňany - independent candidates - won one seat in the municipal council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member assembly.
The second place went to the candidate Obec pro lidl, which received the votes of 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by the independent candidates Naděje pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and, in contrast to the regular elections in 2018, strengthened, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Electoral Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of ecclesiastical buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but state and church have nothing to do with each other
The man fell headfirst from a height of twelve metres.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, with rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Services intervening on his behalf.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
After arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal has caught on in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire brigade went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the emergency services, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The doctor who intervened intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman for the regional emergency medical services, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is primarily doctors and medical staff who are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
The outsider Julianna Pena managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, he showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Victory also went to Kai Kara-France, who quickly dispatched Cody Garbrandt with a first-round TKO.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf," Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even hit her opponent with a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a hand lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents played with a lot of excellent strokes and hard hooks.
Peňová also pushed Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and knock off the attack.
The American shocked everyone by becoming the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier did better, but the tables gradually turned.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to overpower his opponent with an armbar.
He didn't quite manage that, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and hit him with a number of punches.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira landed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a moment, but then had to tap out the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who had already deployed a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of well-aimed punches and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then handled Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter; now, after seven years, she lost.
This hip or that hip?
At first glance, there is nothing complicated about it.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and it is therefore not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the gender is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When folded, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unbent form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern "machine," in the latter according to the pattern "song."
In the next group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/row," "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (meaning food).
Both forms are grammatical, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly, there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "moat" and "moat," "doughnut" and "doughnut," etc.
Some words that entered the Czech language from other languages were originally oblique, but they are gradually adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image," which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet," which remains uninflected in the middle case, but in the masculine case has endings according to the pattern of "castle."
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started heading to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the precarious route?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
Devastating fires, which Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and have ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to gloss over it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual assault, but by spreading the idea that "many of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping sexual abusers.
Houses under construction are flooding the Czech Republic, families do not have the money to complete them
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the resources to complete the family houses that are under construction and the banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete family houses that are already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best-case scenario, people are moving into unfinished and unregistered houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they can not afford to pay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and this has happened to us in fifty percent of cases.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are working without earnings," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they had calculated that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper and iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
However, construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of graduates in construction in the Czech Republic and the influx of foreign workers is being held back by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable.
"In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But a real vision is missing, says a commentator of the Czech Radio - mujRozhlas
In addition to traditional celebrations, the start of the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and chairman of ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
That's why I think the diploma is great, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely relaxed in our country, if you are not a complete idiot and have something left in your head, then the committee will not unnecessarily stifle you with theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got and I got it right.
As for the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there is an exam at the end of the course, which reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defence.
Everything's fine, but don't inundate them with emails and phone calls, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it in a way that he's touching Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta puts obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post a story every day and a new picture at least every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, they keep changing what function is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or a save.
It's really pissing me off lately, so I might have to stoop to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my industry are having success and they don't give a shit.
In the end, I might even be glad if something more user-friendly comes along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Party of Workers of Donbass
Union - yes, break-up - no, this is how the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open connivance of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Białowieża forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, they put the brakes on agriculture, they tore away from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it, put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Just recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out a brochure, I always take things like that to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the workings of the world, but nowhere was there anything about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless instructions, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
What a waste of paper, the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
The psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with the person because you like him, without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on her knees not to go.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started being cheated on.
I then ended the relationship by telling her I was separating and lied to her but said we could talk about it next week to calm her down and stop her from running amok.
Such a person will drain you of your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing here by buying a cloud of tests and chasing the positive ones, who would not even know about this terrible disease without the test.
All we achieve is complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they have already stopped the charade, recognizing that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we're back to the same old shit.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it out (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested in that, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, as I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk them down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realised that if you wanted to make money, you had to sell a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, and I learned not to jump on every rumour and to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many such things.
HR is calm, the managers mind their own business and don't poke their noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation does take place, in the form that it does in our country (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, and the like.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are a kind of quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But that's how it works, they don't bother us too much as long as the results are there.
A Czech woman who went missing in the UK has died.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, no further information will be released at this time.
My sincere condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on the bus on her way home from work, where she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol included her among the missing around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of.
At the end of the year, four municipalities gained new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have been dissolved.
There were 99 valid candidates running for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won mandates.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new council elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
At the very beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease, but it went without any major hiccups.
I'm still struggling to come to terms with how idiotic a large part of the population, at all levels, is about this.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not animals.
He would be deprived of the post of president and of the ability to regain it.
However, the chances of this actually happening are, as others have mentioned here, very small.
Moreover, I am not sure if shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: Growing number of under-35s have gone a whole year without sex
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight per cent to 21 per cent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to be sexually active, with only 5% saying in 2021 that they had not had sex in the previous year.
For single people it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious belief also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, about 30% consider it to be a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people who are unemployed or on a low income are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole Covid vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a segment of the population into behavior they don't want, but which may save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, in which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if we do not order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old person who did not really know much, we did not explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he did not get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be held responsible for the death of a hardened anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, is shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have only themselves to blame.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizerská 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I do have a story, but it's not about a churchgoer.
One day in high school, our teacher took us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and what do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended on us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but they started talking to one of my friends.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly make it clear that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group," which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially provoked a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and a weapon, as night after night we register hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun was already driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving licence for failing to give way and leaving the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, reported TVN24.
She admitted that another nun had bumped into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
She was breathalysed and had her licence immediately suspended after her blood alcohol level was found to be over two per mille.
At the same time, they informed her that she would have to answer for her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Sajmovic, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the dog who taught people how to live, another film, Here We Are, is now competing for viewers' emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film, I'm Watching Over Here from 2012.
Hugo, the talking dachshund, and some of the familiar characters around him return.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, and so they begin to invite dog walkers, Julia's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenager experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog film, but there they were at least entertained by children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that the miraculous process of the dog's recovery can take place in the heart of the Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, is astonished at how much content, full of implausible situations and figures, was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog-walking competition, a Šumava charlatan, police officers arriving to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilising power of bone meal over herbs - and who, of course, get drunk in the guesthouse.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits at the family table, dolled up and made-up, with a cigarette, demanding her father's whisky and meatloaf as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "sometimes this happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build situations, a feel for the characters and the point, and direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their own, they don't have much to play for.
The only merit of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch in a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-whistles, let alone the more vernacular profanities the characters indulge in.
The argument is not even the long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog must be accompanied by knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This did not succeed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to incessant abuse exactly from morons like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how little you understand, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job to earn extra money.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen in some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced a resident of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are susceptible to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in rainfall," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or the recycling of waste water.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
The number of tanker trucks on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, is increasing.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," said Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
Clashes erupt between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said the talks in Vienna had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna have made "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I teased her a bit and grilled her in conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a thug, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers headed for the mountains at the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
The downhillers were not deterred by the obligation to show a COVID-19 certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about a lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the trails and the slopes over the weekend.
The skiers were lucky with the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend has really worked since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, Jakub Hanuš, praising the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena in Karlov and the resort in Branná in Šumperk were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, praised the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn sketch centre told ČTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales outlets are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects more pressure during the ski courses.
The managing director of the Hradec Králové-based company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that, due to Covid-19, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be.
At this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, the pandemic has made people lazy and they have learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, the rental company in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent the runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the area, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include the socialist health care system, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Clever and resourceful people who have no assets here are leaving for other countries.
The owner of a company doesn't just go abroad.
But I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began when, one fine day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position any day now.
Another question is the elections.
If life is bad here, then some traditional V4 lunatic could win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming very concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing by a co-worker on December 3.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman MP, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have a particular responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working for our health service here," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine like that.
These are not "huge numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our involvement.
I quoted above.
I don't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of an expensive joke, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is wrong on so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Well, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague on Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will see several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
New lines have been created, some have changed routes, and others have disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav is newly joining the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice have been stopping at Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will run, which pass through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will now be extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will travel to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavů and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including routes that cross over into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be closed, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will be newly launched.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to the Liberec region, are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, operations on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines, including those to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, have been cancelled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to railway modernisation, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines, and a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being expanded with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a standard 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy next door or Lidl a little further away.
Since I don't do any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and the most I can buy in a hurry is a pizza bun and a yoghurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket that is healthy and does not require cooking?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, that's just the way it is.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're banned from going off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even divorced the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But she says he picked her up, not the other way around.
They are the centre of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
The singer continues what neither of us were looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Either those who are not interested at all and it jumps out at them even from the can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were a good match, or you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's great, that's what you want, Dara complains.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalised.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but have only been legally married for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are only human, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to take a look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole and in that direction is fine, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you are going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can help with Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
To me, this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite all right that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it themselves or let them follow the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot allow a private actor to dominate a part of education just because they can add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, they will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such an assertion loses some of its weight when it is made by a man who, two days earlier, said this about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against abortion is the same as a vote against a statue in the town square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than Odrysian?
Oops: someone has already figured it out for you.
Check out the comment with Φ<unk>ΛH
Politicians do not even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is a much worse problem than the fact that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important documents to be approved are examined word for word, for which a basic knowledge of English is not enough anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with the English language, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm completely fine.
I often leave work at 10pm and it's never a problem.
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of Brno's Romani population lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't:D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the centre, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreaths, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath a long time ago and I'm sure Lucie has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucía, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to talk to, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana and singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that very clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know of any other agency that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so the fire brigade alone and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is down to previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not just be a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and smaller amounts of precipitation are also recorded in places where there has not been a shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought, which prevails in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the way we manage the land also amplifies the impacts.
What should we prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
It's true, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey, and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also total nonsense.
And whether you're a hockey team called "Russia the Bear" or "China the Llama," losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different from when it's tied.
But anyway, what I hear from Czech commentators, what they pick out, what the referees notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it would be business as usual, and since the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost last year" vs "we won."
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
The number of confirmed cases over the past 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1,967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 over the past week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It's the lowest daily total since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Britain's Health Protection Agency, said on television Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalised in the UK, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
UK Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended the fact that the quiz took place "virtually," on a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of staff, gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's UK editor: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can they be expected to be?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit itself, and does other tricks, big and small.
The latest one is that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to funnel voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at the age of 14, my parents - my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my father has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I was terribly angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they gave me a good spanking, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, I used to fight a lot when I was little, now I at least hit something to discharge my anger, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get punched in the mouth too much), so it's never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'll lose patience with my children and do the same.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply fucks something up, it is probably impossible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of such quality pussies.
Otherwise, I would like to know whether you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have enough to pay the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia take the trial of Kuciak's killers?
The main hearing in the trial of four people accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman, Marian Kočner, and his connections to the top echelons of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How significant a turning point will the trial be for Slovakia?
Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they allowed themselves to be fooled, and society paid the price.
Just six months ago, people were dying of Covid on Czech television.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government suspended the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on a repository, as mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The municipalities criticise the draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given locality.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Authority to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted project proposal almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not really have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a repository.
Only in certain licensing procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A possible lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the implementation of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-governments, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorization of the repository, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for this work amounts to almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only deferred to their successors the settlement of the position of local governments vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against the Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep repository.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared off by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new physique in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large frame was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore," Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, for example, or a university text, I would probably be looking for how to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the lord / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not face them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is simply not possible to translate "boss" in a general, one-word way; Czech and other languages do not solve this problem in any way (only Catalan, which translates "boss" as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is, in short, for the story or the game in general, a significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police are also involved in the search.
They have been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since 7 December.
It is also helping the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
A declared search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
He described her as being 5'10" (168cm) tall, thin with brown eyes and long straight hair the same colour.
It should come from Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are concerned for her as it is unusual for her to go missing
Local MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She took part in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
However, it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorised by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
We noticed a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
For the time being, the attackers' strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its title, this time it was marked as "Copy of correction of receipt for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as the e-mail clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic over the past few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment as well as the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or sectors of the population has led to them finding common ground.
The anti-vaxxers, anti-whistle-blowers and co. alone would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the Chcípl pes association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Million Moments for Democracy in Reverse.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose vaccine.
It won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists, of which mankind is justly proud.
No more stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power, were unable to come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" shot footage has become a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been sought by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer and an MP representing the part of London where she lived are also appealing for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming very concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing by a co-worker on December 3.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact police," the statement continued.
The Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) was reported by an anonymous person as infringing copyright with her paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that Krteček's paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a manhole without a cover.
Lives were at stake.
The municipality referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RMD began to "intensively deal with the situation."
