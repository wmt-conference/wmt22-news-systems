The goods cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is equal to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should enclose the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago.... For 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get credit?
I also think in principle that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little brothers and sisters.
However, I think it is also good for big brothers and sisters to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes they have a quick look, sometimes they help, sometimes they bring the bottle etc..
In this way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough child themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that is good.
You're the best judge of whether that's a good fit for your kids.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and spend hours helping him fall asleep.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should really happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Now whether that is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember a few years ago a crime / thriller to have read and I can still remember almost the entire plot but I do not want to remember the title partout more perhaps someone knows here ...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going to his cats of prey in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients finally face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death on purpose).
This facing the fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the general plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows this plot or can even tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the wifi available.
Have to contact my husband first.
That may take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get back the price difference ?
Child, 4 y., splinter under thumbnail

Have tried to pull it with tweezers.
Very hard to grab.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it goes to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on one PCB, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any H0 and 0 gauge locomotive.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker along with a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It handles the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder registers fully automatically with a suitable digital command station.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable command stations.
Auxiliary registers exist for command stations that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode makes reprogramming possible even with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx®-compatible command stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC shuttle train automatic allows automatic shuttling between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railroads.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push for booster vaccination
New cases of Omikron continue to worry politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
By New Year's Day, therefore, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move forward with Corona booster vaccinations even faster than previously targeted in light of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose as early as the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
He said the U.K. government will provide additional support to ensure vaccination campaigns are also accelerated in the country's Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
We are facing an emergency in the face of the Omikron variant, so there is an urgent need to boost vaccination protection, Johnson said.
The good news, he said, is that the level of protection can be boosted again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Get boostered now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were recorded in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, that was a whopping 65 percent increase. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I'm in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation for an interview came by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not a "Peter" but a more complicated name.
I googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me please?
**I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over the feet of any official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Got a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them going.
Only the one I bought today does not go
Obviously the chair had a defect that was not apparent when it was sold.
How can such an upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for approx.
14 days no longer.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something a little detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything about such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes....
But even talking in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help with this in every case.... I know I can't.
But it never makes it any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series on "League of Legends" good for?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg's derby debacle at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be counted on.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in the belly".
This did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby still more than the bare result the way of the appearance disappointed.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma is representative: The three-point quota was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from young John Patrick) on no less than 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and didn't implement what we trained for."
Namely, moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim had a completely different reaction: "An awesome game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people".
Although only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed his team's play.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants avoided a total debacle and came up to eight points, after they had already trailed 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to complain.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.), the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of then also in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 spectators.
we used to have a different mail address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected then.
We did some more legal research and wrote to them again about it.
We originally contacted them half a year ago.
Always as if from scratch: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to thrill his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - when he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official orders" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled for the time being, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe already sang a lot and with pleasure as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he and fellow students founded the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - reached second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair strictly combed back, and mindful of etiquette, it's hard to imagine the current German-language music landscape without Max Raabe.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new home
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is, by the way, the best protection against a monopoly forming.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to appoint a commission of experts on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in particular in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

This is an absolute impudence
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has seen numerous tornadoes pass through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes have caused severe devastation in the U.S. and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a trail of destruction some 320 kilometers long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had ripped through, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that's even possible.
He expects up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that they showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That is a pity.
Is it still in production?
Or is it completely out of stock?
Is there a possibility to order this showcase in another country?
When will you get back to me?
If the delivery can not be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had used the contact form to return an item or post a return and wanted to inquire if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a CONFIRMATION.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash premiums for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - following the German model - is also intended to increase willingness to have Corona vaccinated.
He has moved to a company he has been railing about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and looked for something else.
You are allowed to do that.
And the fact that he didn't like you back then: well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant then, after all.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Congratulations to Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin's Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and tripping over my own feet at the very first Encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the rest of the plot is to unfold.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Persuade, Act, Threaten, Spot the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If the heroes don't notice them, the goblins lie in wait for them in a hollow way and flank the cart three on the left and three on the right, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two possible solutions
1. the heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village sheriff, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. if a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 is?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll definitely take many of your ideas to heart, and I have more confidence in my narratives now too.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put it back together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I would still like to send it back
Can you then the Rückscheine zu come, then I can pack the lamp and bring to the #PRS_ORG#.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race the broadcast was interrupted to let the F1 pre-reporting start on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident meant that the schedule was way behind schedule, they still could have shown the last (scheduled) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again ignorance of the rules by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that it is allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this subject.
On Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility existed for Verstappen.
In my opinion, you should simply know such elementary rules if you commentate on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first guessing game as to what is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them seem simply unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings totally a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he obviously doesn't take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the practice sessions than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
While you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone doesn't let me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
All in all, Sky really is the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here's to this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be shipped on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she would check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlift.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole systems with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (you can find in our store) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar.
The MK-series has a special soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outlet or similar...and you are ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be placed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent, if once water would run backwards, that the water from the basin runs through the pump....
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs, which consume little energy.
Even though here in ebay we state the turnaround time as 3 days, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is disgruntled just because it took a little longer once.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding business...of course here no Corona stops.
Please do not immediately rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
One scolds naturally gladly over these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it damn heavily
This is also very different regionally.
Be angry with no one, stay healthy and we all hope that there are also better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Is it possible to order the legs in light color?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first U.S. man in space, a TV host and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, clad in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a Nasa astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were the company's guests of honor; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
She said he had to work hard on his missions and do everything himself.
She was just along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back into space right now, the presenter said.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again braked by large parachutes.
The International Aeronautical Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth to be the limit for space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space excursion: on the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the touch of a button, you easily preselect whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the light stone retains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative hue.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" luminaire proves its worth outdoors all year round.
In snowy surroundings, its light even does particularly well - only shortened light duration is to be expected as soon as the days turn out to be shorter.
In winter, just make sure that snow does not impair the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can purchase a suitable replacement battery from our webshop to further extend the useful life of your decorative light.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and even standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I have informed myself about career prospects before I started my studies, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely like to study up to my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) one hears again and again super occupation chances and the occupation is totally looked for, on the other hand one hears again and again from unemployed biologists and unbelievably badly paid places.
Therefore I would be really interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what kind of education did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and am thinking about dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience, please write to me :)
Extra stress before vacations & holiday weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
However, I now had to use my long weekend to unwind from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big vacations, like the Christmas vacations, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that there's also stress before holidays plus bridge days.
Last week was Assumption Day, which is called "Ascension Day" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week we had a long 4-day-weekend.
So what went on last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to go out before Ascension Day, orders here and there, all of them *conditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that's not allowed?
Or because people seriously want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-congratulation about holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all in such a mood on their own.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you also know this in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but doesn't have any presents yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She said she will get in the mood for the holiday by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the reflective days: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, I finally have to get going."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of animal losses that occur during molting are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you very much, I found it
Still not working unfortunately
GDR handmade model old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of Modelleisenbahner ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One of the locomotives is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished for operation.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be capable of hauling 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this line.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager propulsion AEG was to supply the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the road numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and subsequently found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn repair facility in Dessau, it was determined that all six locomotives were worthy of refurbishment.
[4] When an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service arose as the re-electrification of the Central German network progressed, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reconditioned in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were given priority.
It was only when it became clear that the number of E 94s could not be increased any further that the E 95s became the focus of refurbishment.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They were transferred to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate rotation schedule mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control system of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
In such cases, the stevedore, who was always riding on the locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the contactors again while the locomotive was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of locomotive downtime.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and with most of the splitter classes, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted electric locomotives to be manned only by one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn from service in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive's exterior began to be refurbished with the goal of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is now in the care of the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Arnstadt Museum-Bw with a new interior and exterior paint scheme, with the transformers having been checked and five traction motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in service until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved their worth due to their reliable propulsion and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the locomotives were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handbuilt model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive in own work is necessary, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handbuilt model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes the F parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet..unfortunately they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can not assemble the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit in the holder provided.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
no not flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the correct of the form, they were only too narrow.
But that does not matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
For me they are not flat
Could I have them sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two light injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has arisen, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were brought to the hospital with light smoke inhalation according to the information on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume that the fire was set intentionally.
The Criminal Investigation Department Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the corona virus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he said, he has refused because the communication should not be about himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind, he said, "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid 19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, he said, so sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
He added that there was prioritization in Germany when it came to vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
The lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire caused severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia were left without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents in several communities on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption could finally be completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The utility thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take several more days, as Westnetz assemblers were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out at around 7:15 p.m. on Friday, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m. onwards.
Since 23.15 o'clock also those still last of the loss concerned would have current.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings at noon on Saturday, the authorities had also called on neighbors to help.
"What is important now is that citizens look after elderly or single people in their neighborhoods and report to local fire stations if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When it came to setting up and operating emergency generators, the focus was primarily on residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care spaces were set up in schools for those people who were unable to care for themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euro?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can not mount the underframe on the table top.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of these.
We wanted those with table top diameter of #NUMBER#.
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however, I can't telescope it and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further with this?
Otherwise I would have to send it back as it is not fit for purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
yes that is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
will you send me the return voucher by mail?
the repair is now finished.
This I had already tried before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before buying it.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this
Nordic combined: Combined Riiber wins
German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to admit defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after ski jumping in the cross-country.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we both s made new and use version 4.5....
it could be that you have heard of problems before.
Have directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be also on it.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupted contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply a new color to the model with the brush for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 or 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the component, which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt pot.
The first stroke on the part
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers ensures an even surface later.
Avoid wiping the brush quickly back and forth.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the darker colors may show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metallic streaks may result when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
Decals or decals give the models a true-to-the-original look.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names to trim and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit is easier to decal before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water decals because you wet the back of the decal with water until the backing paper darkens.
Then you slide the decal just a little bit off the paper and put the decal on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper off to the side.
Caution: Always check that the decal is properly in place before you pull it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Vacuum up excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years

AM Saturday I have already communicated with you before.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived to me in 3 single packages

then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without any problem?
Infertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insured event"?
Hello everyone,
we were some time in fertility treatment, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
First things first:
We had applied for the infertility treatment in advance with the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and performed 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill PKV for them.
We again applied to PKV for coverage and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we performed more attempts than promised, logically settle the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second attempt is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have informed us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insured event?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We will not order anything more from them.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost good customers.
Feel free to pass that on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment has been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
It's not my fault that the chest of drawers arrives completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#.
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regulars.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
Now we will not do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films
There is no general definition of what exactly a low-budget film is with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find many lists of low-budget films, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you?
And what don't you like at all?
Am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is this now also reliable?
Thanks a lot
With kind regards
Gibts there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I give up then soon again times, because it just does not work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost to the EU
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
In the long term, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments, he said.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposing this, this is happening at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, he said, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail when a member state gets it into its head to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
Moreover, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said, adding that a fundamental agreement on asylum policy is becoming more difficult because the "border protection, border protection, border protection" line has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guards, migrants have again attempted to cross into Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained Sunday night and taken back to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said Sunday.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza, she said.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to receive medical treatment from a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to stop departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response has been pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"That's where the EU has brought its market power to bear and shown its determination to operate with hardball and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs, he said.
Belarusian society is arguably not attuned to the security apparatus regularly funneling thousands of people through the country, he said.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula One final.
Max Verstappen is alleged by Mercedes to have committed two breaches of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an objection.
The Silver Arrows suspect not one but two rule breaches in the final Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the final safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken in contravention of the rules.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed according to the rules.
Verstappen had still overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car period in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day
Europa-Park, the namesake of Sport-Club Freiburg's Europa-Park Stadium, has issued an invitation to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white on this day due to the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has already existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park showed again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is that €#NUMBER# and not 1699€ as originally ?

I already had a huge hassle with you back in #NUMBER# when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I posted the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything.
My question would be if my request was received.
Not everyone has the time for your dopey chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Ms #NAME#.
I can not chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would get an email with a 60 euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email did not come so far.
I would like to bring the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With kind regards

Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-semite means nothing.
That's like an afdler saying he has nothing against foreigners.
Their i admit it both will not.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are similarly little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions the evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god has brought the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science only nonsense verzapft.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To get an optimal field of view, the magnifier should be moved as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and color errors up to the peripheral zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your loupe optimally, we ask you to observe the information in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical instruments, including single-vision magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimum conditions of use are maintained - magnifier close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further instructions can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women select the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many a curious situation at the fir tree sale.
Once, a man is said to have gone home without his partner because the two could not agree.
Every year, he plants a good 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a little funny, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid full price for it.
Then I will also rate this accordingly!
We don't need to debate the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their name from that.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which sounds nowhere near as delicious.
Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few dropouts.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module). rooms away from the other module).
As a result, with the new fiber connection, the internet is now even slower on the second floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which yes apparently uses new technology.
This one was slightly better than the DLan, but again there were similar big losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely costly to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change checking accounts
Anyone who thought that the current accounts would be quiet for the time being is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to have their customers reconfirm past fee increases with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has halved the allowance and even quartered it for overnight deposits.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank Group division - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight deposit accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers."
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as it did at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which even got right in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly form provisions - in case the higher courts also declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been named the most influential woman of the year by US magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Her appearance is taken care of by a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, says Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of the female and male fans nevertheless fly to her equally, is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky - and still looking for the big love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That pained her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Lets hope that success and fame also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the barriers, Raikkonen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix less than halfway through the race.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, and the "Iceman" ended his career in motorsport's premier class.
His wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 world championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I've done the math, I'd have to get nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, skiing from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove out a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he won ahead of Brad Hall from Great Britain.
Austrian Benjamin Maier finished third.
"We took bigger risks today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also claimed his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner of Berchtesgaden, who races for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after finishing second earlier.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after placing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte took her third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple with pusher Deborah Levi.
Olympic two-man bobsleigh champion Mariama Jamanka of BRC Thuringia finished second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt of Burghausen.
She recorded her first podium finish this winter in addition to her Olympic qualification.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama took me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it.
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
i already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem why I finally asked.
By Corona I had last year completely different problems and never time for it.
And now they said it had expired which makes me very upset.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again since it is currently reduced :)
Why was shipping not started until March 16?
There was nothing about such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken down yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered would.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY....
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some what I just want to write and maybe it goes to one - or another so ...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6yrs) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is in therapy now).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him to take a shower (because his hand is in a bandage because of a burn).
On top of that he has a cold and we see each other less at the moment (1-2x week) which makes me very uncomfortable with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomach ache right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and stroking.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now there is also housework to do, which we share of course.
But cooking by myself is a lot of work for me right now....
My PTSD disease is currently quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not well, but I am coping and am almost symptom free.
My university demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
Only until my birthday.
Only until vacations start.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, otherwise I won't be able to cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think it also has something to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here....
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
Now if we will exchange the table I will get other color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 12/26 #NUMBER#.
Two times, by the way.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me that was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and so I always kind of believed.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe in it?
Preserving culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write gladly English that I also understand well
That is already very long, then I would refrain from it
All right, thank you.
I expect to hear back in a timely manner, no later than early next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello Dear All,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
One is the modern age (real world).
On the other hand the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and a plot develops.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
The passage is also the tomb of the soldier, I think.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If this means something to you I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure that everything around is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minute supervision.
It's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does he turn his head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the belly?
Or does he lie face first directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce if everything is okay.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their bellies to sleep.
Besides, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But then why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my closet that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the wardrobe.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used like this at this time.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be delivered.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station is now under all sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a running advertising pillar".
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising station, which tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may of course continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How should one find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for recall, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for a tummy ache or just to cuddle with, My Little Warmth Friend has many uses.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes it particularly comfortable to use, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for uncharacteristic odor, stick or burn marks and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the microwave manufacturer's instructions!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated use.
It is imperative that you adhere to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy levels can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After placing the heated inner pillow back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow in case of acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds as well as in case of persons with reduced sensation of pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please consult a physician before use.
If sutures have opened and loose cores are leaking, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first half - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
Ingolstadt is still not doing well under its third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
This I bought new about 5 months ago, so should still work.
I thought power supply alone is also sufficient for operation.
Wrong, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but again nothing happens.
Maybe you have some ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thanks for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour but still carrying a lot of gear?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity swallow even larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday use remains well organized and separable from the photo gear thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
Here, the closure flap houses a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thereby considered different "filling levels": there are namely 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: when you're carrying not only your photo gear, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side to access camera gear in the right main compartment, for example, while everyday items stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're headed to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# has sent me yesterday an email from confirmation for the order of the
Contact announced on the part of the shipping company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I write now already with the third support coworker, with none I came further than to the promise, which I receive a Mail as confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrong delivered custom #NAME#.
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it like this is not an option for me....
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you still a nice evening
hello, my order no. is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend me the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year went differently than expected I could not have foreseen and just could not redeem and clarify it in time.
But the damage I have as a customer and I do not accept it that way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
Tuned discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the disc cooling, while the gates improve the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
Aesthetic features of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car by attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered luminous chunks in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked what became known as the "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous towns in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was Coloma or Bust!
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and making a name for yourself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You'll also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent territories.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You'll have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can use fine adjustments to develop your individual play style.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the map where they can take actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the matching locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, pitching tents, fording rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The praiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each turn, changing the actions available.
This continues until the bragger has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a gunfight in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, at which point the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not bullies" Docu, ARD Mediathek.
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
His book "Warum unsere Kinder Tyrannen werden" (2008, tr: Why our children are becoming bullies) triggered a heated debate on parenting.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to take.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
For us parents and other responsible persons, it must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his or her development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: States discuss abolition of compulsory testing for triple vaccinated persons
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated.
"We states need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be dropped for triple vaccinated people," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on this as early as next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me out with this?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchasing via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer works.
I have updated the account data.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, the least common is seeing images, and the very least common is perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are surgeries associated with increased rates of awareness because of the avoidance of very deep anesthesia to protect the infant until weaning.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia preconception interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does correctly describe awareness, however, u/Nitemarex **by definition did not have any.
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is besides the legal obligation also standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
Since we also lose some money.
I already sent you an email, which you did not answer.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called them.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is this the case?
If so, I need to cancel the order as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to my second floor.
Am I not going to get a phone call?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, hot off the press: "An Old Man Grows Older."
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world that theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life thanks".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are used as load carriers primarily in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL).
In 2020, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria, according to data from Statistics Austria.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria each year is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After a 1-1 draw in regulation time against host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final 4-2 in a penalty shootout.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed over Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
We had that for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I have a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will prepare a beef stock for it.
Other than that, do you guys have any tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can manage that
Iit is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed on 18.01. by mail that the refund was made.
But until today I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where to still find Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
You have not yet got poultry?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amp sound.
These characteristics are perfectly realized by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
As mentioned above, the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to provide a power reserve for when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footswitch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the effects that are compatible with it.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX takes another step into the future!
Had seen that but with others so.
Is there then you possibility to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send it back then.
Can you help me further with this?
And the commode?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs.
If it can't be done, I would be happy with a discount or voucher as well.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I do not need are then but a bit much.
I just received my shipment and would like to know if screws were included as part of the shipment.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hooks provided.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
Iran says progress is emerging in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
He said this was a "positive and important development" because initially there had not even been agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is aimed at preventing Iran from building nuclear weapons.
Vienna talks to revive the agreement had resumed Thursday after a nearly week-long hiatus.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A U.S. delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now Federal State with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
It is the only federal state to have a figure above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only state in Germany with the Corona incidence on Sunday above the mark of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day figure as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide recently, that figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to infection were reported in one day.
200 people severely ill with Covid-19 were receiving intensive medical care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, health departments have been overburdened for weeks and are barely keeping up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery isn't until early March, maybe it's possible by then.
i have to print this out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, right?
here i don't have to click/add/fill out anything else?
This is exactly what I would like to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to please return at my own expense.
8 euro return shipping fee is an impertinence in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
###Why the post here?
If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag you can see one thing: It is not extistent.
We got into a winter rigidity and extended the summer hole to several months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what's the problem?
For the most part, it's probably simply related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we've been generally.
In the last few days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here really still want to go to the MBundestag.
#What we have to change
At this point the community around the MBundestag is asked, which wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last days and found a, simply said, shambles.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone to participate, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing rules have to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside in the future?
* How should we recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not bad, we have the Discord at the end for that.
If you feel like it and have time, come to the Discord, collaborate and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade for this from you that is yet to be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about this.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for the pickup - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself was a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When I was asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking much.
Namely, that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "crude"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without that you would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date that #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, since I am unable to be on site due to a funeral, this cannot be changed.
Can an alternative pickup date be assigned to me please.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am to be found again throughout.
Lahnstein fire department equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euro grant from the state
The Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, recently handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte in Lahnstein's town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the number of deployments is expected to increase in the long term: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a recreational river are contributing to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% of the way through and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
Followed their recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now hope for help.
Okay, is then so.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thanks first of all for that you face the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, speak we were also gun carriers in the executive, further I do not want to go into it!
The question of right and left I always find very simplified.
Basically one should say however that naturally the civil servant comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be actually clear to everyone.
That of course also in particular uniforms and weapon carriers magically attract people right of conservative should also be clear to everyone, that these people then of course with the lived reality difficult to deal with is of course also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, Women and homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't notice it if they don't tell you) and I can and must also rely on these people, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But also these fringe groups represent, even if it sounds funny at first, in my experience a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly stands up for them or means to make it right for them, but they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but that these may openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to generalize due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
Also it happens that certainly also times right minded comrades meet which operate a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such a thing is well fought in my opinion and also counteracted with political education and education of the whole!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good so in my opinion that we could not afford it at all to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered back in November.
but it was confirmed to me so in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could you still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but on the top of the wooden part there are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, me (w32) is concerned with one thing for a long time.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I've managed to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never so "that someone could come spontaneously to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses to work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become tidier with child?
We don't have one yet but we are working on it and this question has been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high quality as well as anatomically preformed cut, provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, wide embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and knee bends)
To the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (underarms, arm and knee bends)
High-quality pre-curves in the lower back and crotch provide a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending over and mounting and donning gear on the surface.
Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of protection against the cold.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face at the hood increases comfort, waterproofing and durability (separate head hood).
Soft zone located in the collar improves waterproofing with fine adjustable width adjustment using a flexible, gentle Velcro closure that does not stick to the liner or seams

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I trained in software development and have been out for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (AEVPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have relaxed conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think this has improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in addiction counseling or family support.
However, I don't know if the concrete working day is really like I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The AOPD already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("screwed up the simplest things again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself by now"/"I keep him from doing his job with my stupid questions"/"he must really think that I'm a moron" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
But you already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for collection
What do you mean by return please !
When I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the food in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its own proteins from these in turn, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this course of administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In cases of severe plumage damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio may be given initially until the onset of new plumage is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is given until plumage reformation is fully complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months ?
The warranty in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in conflict with the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be felled.
So felling request submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes me that the cutting of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the bylaws.
But in the statute the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for them.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me then a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check this?

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good, because my dear head is thinking up everything that can be thought up.
Before I get carried away here ... in short: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing my Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I mention nothing more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that might be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with the teaching profession and was sure that this is it - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'll google other job postings."
And it's only been six months.
The times before that I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can always change my mind.
But right now I am absolutely done.
I had the last month so little free time that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacations, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my end of the day was my end of the day.
That's when I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it's not already doing that.
I ask myself whether I want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your posts here - or whether I shouldn't go back to my old job, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work kind of boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back in the same place in a year's time and be dissatisfied.
You realize, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how I get out of this situation, that I am completely finished and virtually at the slightest thought of it begin to cry.
I won't make any decisions right now so emotionally, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, resulting in, among other things, the combination of advanced modeling technology with "Valve Reactor" circuitry that perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amps are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amp better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
VOX's "Tone Room" software even lets you correct and bend historical facts on the virtual plane until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Since then, of course, it has been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, resulting in another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to satisfy all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power amp that determines the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances and sonic character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Magic lose at Clippers despite 20 points from Wagner
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable, with three Velcro dividers that can be individually placed and folded to suit the needs of your photo gear, making it suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLRs.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible load would be a DSLR camera with one lens attached, two to three interchangeable lenses and an attachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models in the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can still stow a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data are available on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists continued to dare not predict when it might end.
Indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Millions in damage
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new spits of land with a combined size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
The most severely affected sector was banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
There is something seductive about the many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling excitement.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peacemaking "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked Christmas with gift-giving.
Before that, gifts were given to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as the Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants took offense at this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "worship of saints."
For these reasons, they opposed the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such matters of detail so narrowly, it upsets only a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the custom of St. Martin with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's parade.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christianized countries, there is a merry huddle over who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white ruffled beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man walking into a bank and a bookmaker's store with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle, according to authorities, which officers were able to stop a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit, they said.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police did not assume a terrorist background.
The area around Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative lamp will harmoniously fit into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar panel for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully inside.
Smart Stone", on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in no less than six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither power supply nor batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any place that receives sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes provide a firm hold if needed.
The matte white plastic cover itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
"Smart Stone" discreetly hides its solar panel inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; you decide for yourself in which color: There are no less than six attractive light colors to choose from - in addition to daylight white.
The light is also switched off automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predefined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I have done that several times it does not work.

Pill problem
Hello dear female people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and crappy PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to stop taking it again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had explosively developed pimples from 0 to 100 on my last break of about two years and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it took quite a toll on me and I didn't feel well.
In the two year break it never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without fuss, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately my gynecologist didn't take me that seriously and my dermatologist appointment is still coming up.
Many thanks to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes the dear skin is so ne thing.
I had bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-area nodular lichen and the acne issue.
Nutrition I have also in the course of chr. disease tried everything possible and am stuck on ner sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed diet, because nothing else has worked so well.
It may well be that hormonal simply the worm is in it, but if you have like me everywhere construction site you want to just rather not go looking for what else is wrong.
I had already told everything to her colleague semina or similar.
Written and now I lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone....
what is there to check, if the money was there I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The underground cable, which is around seven kilometers long, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has arrived so far only in parts.
The blue Betsellnummer:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the further process is now?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget it, I explained it several times yesterday!!!
This is a dresser made of glass and all the sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, therefore yes the inquiry with #PRS_ORG#, since it concerns probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I am currently still having a lot of problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as media.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free at school (which sucks for geography).
I currently just take a long time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every lesson actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the assignments in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe some geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time efficient way.
Would be really pleased.
i would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one from #PRS_ORG# however I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
Retailers fear for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered may enter most stores.
Retailers think this is unnecessary and complain about a drop in sales.
They also have a possible solution.
In the view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized that sales of non-daily consumer goods were plummeting.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers conducted by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business, he said.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," Genth said.
Accordingly, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retailing and in the online sector, he added.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not bring us forward in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deter customers and require high staffing levels, he said.
The ribbon scheme must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the wristband received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in the retail sector - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, the real estate group specializing in shopping centers, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent.
These figures are now sure to fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, the company is trying to find solutions for the centers and get them approved.
These include the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof once at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel - can enter all stores without being disturbed." dpa
i recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame that was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
It looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and taped it shut.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual- balance, based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is provided by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to brightness adjustment, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and tungsten.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The fixture produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness with virtually no change in color temperature.
It's a great tool for working both on a film set or else in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the fixture in television studios or when the fixture is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the fixture is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To adjust the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when turned on again, the known situation is again - very handy when working in the studio, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester built right in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlamp via the included power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
You have for mounting a 16mm sleeve as a connector, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The tilt can be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
Care has been taken that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that in the scope of delivery is also included a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got this as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after high-scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row winless Hesse were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned on the heat, got rid of the frustration about a mixed start to the season within an hour and won furiously 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise to every single person who was involved.
Initially, it looked like another setback for Frankfurt, which is still behind its expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next impressed even the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since matchday four and overcoming a muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is unbelievably great," said the 27-year-old, who, looking at the result, was particularly happy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned for this in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
Our medical department is doing a great job, but the players are also living a highly professional life.
Now they want to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and "pull through the tasks at this level until the turn of the year".
Next on the agenda is already on Wednesday in the course of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 clock, Sky).
Just got the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be resent directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would mean for me then unfortunately that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have they ever sat in the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for women's handball before quarterfinal against Spain
Germany's handball women crept off the parquet with hanging heads and blank stares after their humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat with 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to perform differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round Group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game from everyone and we have to erase it," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semifinals, a significant improvement will be needed against the 2019 World Cup runners-up next Tuesday to keep the fragile dream of a first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-row player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted back-rower Xenia Smits and demanded, "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not up to scratch from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to scratch from the opening whistle.
Missed shots and technical mistakes in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few saves.
The DHB team scored its first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the initial spark they had hoped for.
The German women were hardly able to make an impact against the aggressive Danish cover - and if they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian goal.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she will be allowed to play again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get into the game a little better and at least come within five goals by the break.
However, any hope of catching up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, Groener's charges sinned in all areas and made it easy for their well-performing opponents, who are among the medal candidates at the finals.
As a result, the German team could no longer muster up an increase in performance and went down as clear losers.

The title gives it away, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated mainly in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished to a large extent, it continues afterwards partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit about the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to one personally (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility falls the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to Coronaimpfveordnung and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and if necessary the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any with us, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they cannot (are not allowed to?) perform vaccinations, so I also perform most vaccinations there myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What please is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, in the BR television broadcast "we in Bavaria" for heavy thinking was provided.
But unlike on many previous days, this time the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also not one "to whom everything must go quickly".
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this was a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an education gap was closed - probably also with some, which live for a long time in the area Amberg.
I have not been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
It always comes after the confirmation the following error message: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Choice of tires for road bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of beans because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
No sooner said than done and I set off on my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in so every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire wanted to do the rest of the distance in no way.
Since I had no real possibility due to the weekday to get me spare tire and spare tube, I had to turn around with half bad mood again and take the first best track home.
Was then also mood-technically not quite so bad, maybe it's better if I practice again before the bike tour that with the tire change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now wass really not bad, since also still the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, has on the day I came to pick up the bike to 14 clock 120km torn off!) and who had also already called these suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But when I think that I have to change a tire while driving after 80-90kms, I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
Now I'm with an older man at the platform came into the conversation, who asked me in wonder why I do not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplattbar.
Now of course the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 € / tires now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
Although there are also (apparently?) With the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike generally to other tires?
The Schwalbe side seems to my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and love!
Car skids into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained reasons against a center island and then on the oncoming lane, as the police said.
There it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high end full range driver B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also have offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal is a suitably designed foot directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Based on the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level should be achieved in terms of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it performs remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight treble rise.
This is common with full-range speakers to optimize the bundling that increases strongly to high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outward, the high frequency range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which are worthy of reference, ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolving power and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning to plan appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the countersink of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer will add more material.
After all the panels have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point, so that you can later feed the cable through there without any problems.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening now follows in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the bevel, as shown in the picture "Detail bevel".
Then you start the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side panels on a flat surface in front of you.
Now glue the back panel, the lid, the front and the bottom onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued in the process.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, e.g. if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to attach the second side.
This is followed by all the panels of the base, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear panel is facilitated.
Then use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The base plate is then glued firmly to the base of the cabinet and also screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw connection points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the cabinet has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear panel.
To do this, push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base up to the terminal opening and let it stick out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the cabinet the cable is led to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in place, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely sealed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and seal it that way.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed tight with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and loosely distributed in the cabinet.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I also place an order now and not have it delivered until early June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will organize the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, we are not able to get more than four people in the studio for known reasons, which has meant more planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people by circuit, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We'll do our best to avoid delay or other issues.
But hey, it's still pandemic - still, we'll do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Go ahead and chill drinks, plan on some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
