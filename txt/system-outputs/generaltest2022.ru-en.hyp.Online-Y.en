From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
Micropackage Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, and moderately soft — by a natural latex plate.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the appearance of a “wave” or “hammock” effect.
Among the advantages of the model, breathable materials should be highlighted.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the bed is maintained.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is placed on the removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Pair an orthopedic pillow with the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides — coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember with horror these feasts and guests in my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still fried on the stove, the mother is sloppy washing the floor.
God, I was already exhausted at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you drag food, cook for two days, cleaning after the day.
And what about the guests?
They feel good, and they must also have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays and guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at a minimum wage.
And I cook sweets for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
Ulrich Weigeldt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this
This is on Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in autumn,” the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination.”
This will help you achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of coronavirus Omicron.
Moreover, the new version is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus Omicron.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain,” BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, is in favor of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel's experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 Wobbler, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created taking into account use for ice fishing, and not just for throwing fishing.
These vibes have a larger specific weight than analogues similar in size, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a “winter vib” when fishing in a plumb line, Bet-A-Vib shows a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movements of the angler up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, driftwood and other obstacles for which hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for zander and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive feed of the lure is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS — NanoSound) or without it (SL — Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib with a plumb line game is able to tease a passive pike that does not react even to live bait.
When fishing, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For fishing for pike, pike perch, ruff or perch, in addition to uniform, a “step” is also relevant, sometimes with a “chirping” along the bottom.
If you fish in clogged places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively shallow and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

Libya announced 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
“Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), “Anadolu quotes him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in Central African Republic.
Keep Presence
According to the source of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, uses the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the air base in Jufra, according to the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where Else Could Be Mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the exploitation of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries”, - it is spoken in the article.
According to the media, the Wagnerites allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed either in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second house of parliament with advisory functions with the dominant Islamists in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the election of deputies to parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
“There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing,” the article says.
Against this background, the Supreme Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reported.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more success than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
“Examples of success are “they defended in Syria, peace has been restored there”, “the decision on Nord Stream-2”, “the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons”, “We squeezed out Crimea”.
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, - it is spoken in the study of the Foundation “Public Opinion”.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become digital only
The Dubai government announced a complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.

Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council.
From now on, internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will be carried out only digitally through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's indicators for 11 months were worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if in the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector showed a positive trend compared to last year, by the end of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a drop in economic activity in all industries.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of the Kazinform News Agency reports.
“According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to the instructions of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, an order of the Chairman was adopted Agency No. 127 dated April 9, 2021 “On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses,” Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to a deputy request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting a deferral of loan payments provided for the granting of deferral of loan payments by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities, issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
The borrower's application could specify a different period for deferring payments.
During the deferral period, claim work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection by the creditor of commissions and other payments,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain “okmiron”
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the okmiron coronavirus strain can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the context of the emergence of the virus
Scientists believe that “okmiron” originated in the body of an HIV-infected person or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
Due to this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate “okmiron” more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old people suffer it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is rabid in the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, he hits sparrows like a cannon, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the former is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, only symptoms can often be stopped - all hope is for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may begin vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarten students,” Pavel Volchkov, virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, told Moscow 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.

And at home, gathering with friends, we would dance to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of covid
The authors of the work studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also studied the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid a response from the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this.
The biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Semyon Golosheykin, Candidate of Biological Sciences, named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik Radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person can hardly navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role,” he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by addictions - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence,” the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the N.I.
Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Impairment at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return home about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Ghawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, “he said.
Abdel Gauad said that all smuggled artifacts are registered in archives.
Currently, employees of the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural property is restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamen sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research of “black diggers”.
“Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - the number of Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - telecommunication operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline until which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse does not officially comment on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his “ego”.
He is already outside any literary associations, spit out with imaginism, it is on its own, but it is known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even viciously, but the reading audience is ready to wear it on hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the Persian Motives cycle has been completed, the poem “Anna Snegina” was written, 8 books were published, and the collection “Soviet Russia” were published.
And the main success is that at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House signed an agreement with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of Sergei Alexandrovich's modern poets have been honored with such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1,000 rubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstoy, and it was necessary to arrange family life, support sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
Life seemed to be getting better, there is something to rejoice at, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem “The Black Man” (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field
Eh, like a grove in September,
Alcohol showers the brain.
Many friends noted that Yesenin passed a lot, looks bad, is clearly sick.
Increasingly, parties and nervous breakdowns are repeated.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis of alcoholism was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there were no reliable documents left.
For example, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (again Yesenin will get to him two years later, in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's binge drinking, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 1920s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found it in rented apartments, hotels or friends.
Startsev recalls:
“I only came to spend the night, and in most cases in a state of insanity, drunk.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
When he recovered a little, he began to cough continuously, sprinkling blood all over the sheet...”
And Yesenin himself, after a voyage to Europe and the United States (there was prohibition in the United States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
“I didn't see anything there except taverns and streets...
I'm at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, I drank, of course...
And I drank because my longing was bitten to death.”

Now my son is almost 16, and he has not been tormented by the desire to fool for a long time.
All the energy is directed to choosing what he will do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was in his age or my husband, who periodically had problems with the law until the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, with “strange love”.
Why did the girl cry during the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
Retake.
Millions of students know this.
What are we talking about anyway?
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon” against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon”
Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends next year to return to such an “operation”.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made a corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenka”, but he “is actively looking for new ways”.
The Polish official is also sure that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to kp.ru, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe announced its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve.”
Minsk in response imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

Back in September, at the premiere of the film “No Time to Die”, he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional “Bond” butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not correspond to the royal dress code to the Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah also tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Ballon d'Or in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to be bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, navy blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto came to one of the premieres of the film “House of Gucci”.
When choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a fleecy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
“Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a gala event,” explains Vakhoshkin. “It is also suitable for cases where the invitation says dress code “Black Tie” or “Creative Black Tie”.
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must get the right advanced get-together with prosperity,” the authors of the Handsome Brammell Telegram channel about men's fashion believe. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, tassel loafers, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from “Handsome Brammell” are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate party, but when it comes to “a leader from among those who do this he runs the event, then “yes”, he has such a thing in the topic.”
If the employee is of a lower rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase “Senka's hat is not for Senka,” the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it pulls so tormented.
And it is not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But I wholeheartedly wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid.
Billions of dollars in investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy also does not lose money - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
Who's in flight then?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.
Does the sheriff have problems with the Indians?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who “overslept” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I did not see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then most likely they will not get hooked on them.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such “handsome men (-its)”, but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, “a slave who is aware of his slave position and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he smug describes the delights of slave life and admires the good and good master is a slave, a boor.”
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus “omicron”
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection omicron.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccine in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “a very long period”
“With the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four months,” the expert said, urging in parallel with vaccination campaign, to engage in booster vaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early booster vaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he was ill and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and got sick, then he received “hybrid immunity”, that is, there are many antibodies and there are enough neutralizing antibodies,” said the expert.
The G7 warned Russia about “large-scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that the “military aggression” of Russia against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost dearly” Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation building up the military power of Russia and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine, “the statement said.
Ministers further call on Russia to “ease escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding military transparency”, as the US President says Biden spoke during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” they also state G7 Foreign Ministers.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response, “they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's reserved position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response, “the statement also reads.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would undergo “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “the single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia”.
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was made by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug against COVID-19.
“We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety,” said Professor Malick Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality, if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Alexey Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to destroy drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine is still unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of the Ukrainian territories.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same “illogical” position under the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany “will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense”, the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habeck, co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, visited the republic, where he called for the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

But apart from hatred, gossip, scandals, there is not much to remember.
I feel sorry for her, my life lived in anger.

They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that is not used online -shopping.
Part of your savings can be saved to a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure technology, you can start a refund procedure.
“Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the settlement chain who does not uses this service”, said the representative of Promsvyazbank.

Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream-2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops in the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream-2, through which it is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for controversy.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the operation of Nord Stream-2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
US officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to shut down the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior congressional official said Tuesday USA.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, a position confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the Big sevens.”

It is always surprising when they write about means to wash the sink, toilet, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something, that you have to wash them directly.
Just don't let it get dirty.

Plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the large evangelical church Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians will have wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do, “KPRC-TV quotes him.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, for information about the criminals, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which once allocated $5,000 for the award and later received another $20,000 as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic of “as a real person”.
Therefore, the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it's not that “she is financially much richer than all hacks”, as they say here.
There are richer people, but not everyone is as impudent, as defiant as this madam.

“The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic,” Barroso said.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities ordered tourists unvaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection against COVID-19 has been disclosed
Anatoly Altshtein, virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia, revealed a scheme for full protection against coronavirus infection in an interview with URA.ru.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
When used internasally, immunoglobulins A are formed in large quantities. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane so that the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination, “the doctor said.
Sergey Tokarev, chief dispensary of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection vaccination is the ability to stop be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, Nizhny Novgorod Region Minister of Health David Melik-Huseynov said that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture that is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to a male dog (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, affection, love and games for a tight female, then go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works 90% of the time.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners not to run after the dog, although they lamented that 200 thousand were running away (pomsky), took my hand straight and led them in the other direction.
As a result, “200 thousand” chose the owner, and not a dog that ran somewhere there.
Mass protests of opponents of vaccination do not stop in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters that read “This is a false pandemic”, “I will not be vaccinated”.
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife venues.
The authorities of a number of regions of the country decided to introduce sanitary passports against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators threw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even Wikipedia does not agree on this issue.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as “the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine”, probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
But I agree with Zakharova with one thing: the Americans only carried death and looting to any country wherever they appeared.

WHO has discovered “omicron” in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus omicron has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of a new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was told in the WHO message.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to be actively distributed only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the delta strain in terms of spread, which is also the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “omicron” in the coming months will replace the “delta”.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially several hundred people are currently ill with omicron in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain “omicron”, and at its peak, more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is still unknown how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to omicron - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.
Why should we see the stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE your exercises in more detail.
It is not clear in the first exercise how to do it: sitting on your heels or kneeling, as it is written, but how then can you rest your hands on your hips?
Or hands on your waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communicating on the Internet is completely different, they communicate easily and naturally, and there is nothing to say in person.
And seeing a person live may not be what you expected, did not catch you - hence the attitude.

And again, Soviet times are called the “time of demons”.
People believed in God much more honestly back then than they do today.
And they were brought up almost according to God's laws (love for your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What an ideology today is money at any cost.
There is not enough faith for talkers like Globa (and it does not exist at all), but even so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we are trying to preserve the warmth of relations between the older generation
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and no one canceled the blockade brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, come on!
Human cubs, especially males, are strong, mobile, energetic, furious, pushing, fighting, just like their little “brethren” in wildlife!
It's a pity that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, scratches are common, and not a boomerang!
And for what?
Did you push your brother without calculating his strength?
Are you always so clever that you never accidentally hurt anyone and have never injured yourself?

$135 billion went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on apps increased by 25% worldwide and downloads by 8%.
Various video services turned out to be the most popular in the world.
Most of all, users downloaded the CapCut video editor, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both app downloads and user spending showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in applications increased even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data were published by App Annie, an analytical company, which presented a report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy came out of lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
“Will this “return to physical” slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all,” the authors of the report believe.
India became the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all app downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all app spending.
Among apps, the CapCut video editor took the first place in terms of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: the MX TakaTak video service and the Meesho online trading app.
Telegram is also in the top 10 in terms of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two of them in the top 10 - VPN Master and NighTowl VPN) and services related to creating and broadcasting videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak in the top 10 includes two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
“Users spent the most in applications for live broadcasting and online streaming,” the authors of the report note.
YouTube is the leader here, and the top 5 in terms of user spending also include TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max streaming video services, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok occupy the first places in terms of the number of monthly active users, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office closes the top 5.
In Russia, the AliExpress shopping application turned out to be the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year.
It is followed by the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also, the top 10 applications include: StarMaker online karaoke, Shein online clothing retailer, Maps for Minecraft PE app, DiDi online taxi ordering service, Pure Tuber YouTube client, app Dixy retailer and Samokat online store.
All over the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to life in mobile, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The greatest success has been achieved by industries that helped people be closer both virtually and personally,” commented Lexi, Head of Market Research at App Annie Sidow.
The mobile gaming sector reached $90 billion in revenue in 2021. The leaders in terms of the number of downloads were casual and hypercasual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and the video design is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2 is leading among games: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends next year, the company's analysts named the increase in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity of financial applications among Generation Z, such as investor applications Robinhood, as well as a further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

Russians were warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is written by Izvestia with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Product Director at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real records involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the features of the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of a person for blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Varonis leading system engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I focused on the fact that I bought it all in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow me to paint much and walk in short skirts, show stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but the store HAD such a product.
In big cities, Muslim women also painted and showed their thighs.
This is how Dushanbe is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of fashionistas, but there are no cosmetics.
Five actions that will help avoid diabetes mellitus are listed
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by malnutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect yourself from diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the “weekend migraine” among workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being on weekends
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often “weekend migraine”, said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the faculty fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics suffer especially often from this, who have headache, weakness and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue that has accumulated over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
On weekends, our lives change radically.
“We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued. “Due to the lack of coffee, a little withdrawal begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water, it is heavy and broken.”
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs for travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracing what changes the most on weekends.

Scientists of South Africa announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against “omicron”
South Africa announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against omicron
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the neutralization rate of “omicron”) corresponds to (the level) of effectiveness of the vaccine of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... questions the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save you from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word, hidden sugar may be indicated in the product - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label can contain several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how the ingredient in the product is called syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues to switch to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
“That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine's transportation of Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement recording Berlin's support for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the certification process of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet “comply with the requirements” of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.

Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, a majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49 per cent (75) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France 762) voted “against”.
The turnout was 43.90%, and more than 80,000 New Caledonians took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt”, as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full-fledged and “honest” election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and 53.3% in 2020.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of independence of New Caledonia has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining within France, as it is “the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific”.
“New Caledonia must remain French,” Eric Zemmour has repeatedly repeated.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of Caledonians be the choice of France”.
Sveta, oh hello!
I'm a little... a little rude to you, I'm still awkward, ashamed.
Thanks for not turning your back on my channel.

Just do not forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity was not as common as it is now.
But medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic and decoctions.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger posed by Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “act as a united front against Russia.”
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
“There is quite a lot of false information in this article,” RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexey Arestovich
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: the hull and the like, “Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it “in all respects”.
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the country had begun construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the fugitive lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion ran away from the owner and walked around the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, contributes to the growth of cancer cells
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchen advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure up or down.
Kitchen recommends that you do not take vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid milk cereals and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men after 50 years of age eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April due to the omicron strain may die about 75 thousand people
Forecasts of British scientists show that up to 75 thousand people may die due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus in the next five months in England, if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are members of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded, and a total of about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
“Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from becoming overloaded if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines will not be able to exclude infections, “said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the Health Safety Agency of Great Britain informed: if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year the country will about 1 million cases of infection have been detected.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected over the past 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.
After all, I wanted to write some clever comment, but I read it to this point:
“A fur coat obtained as a result of the incredible suffering of an unfortunate animal and its employment for a second job.”
And it fell under the table!
So the “unhappy animal” is the husband, and I thought it was a chinchilla!

The demand for superyachts grew by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units, which is a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million dollars pounds and more, will not decrease, writes “The Guardian”.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a stir in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to escape the pandemic aboard their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted in zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more so that their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling governments to action and proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, this will be extremely difficult to do.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183 meter REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a “lunar pool”, as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
Helicopter platforms, open-air cinemas have become common on existing superyachts, and some of them, such as the yacht of wrestler McGregor, have a martial arts platform. Professor economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana Richard Wilke says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas samples, the carbon footprint produced by the super is negligible.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that there are a little more than 2000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the trace of the average inhabitant of the planet.
While one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest polluter on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail came to his yacht Eclipse with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not arouse the sympathy of other people when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no berth places.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships less than 50 meters away.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express writes about this.
Experts came to the conclusion that drinking four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinkers have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or rather all dog lovers, believe that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how developed four-legged pets are actually.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although the dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as human vocabulary, a new study proves that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, do not understand anything about politics, economics and art, while they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine has prepared for bargaining between the United States and Russia
The US and Russia will “bargain” over Ukraine's entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to “join anywhere.”
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offeror.
And bargaining is planned in relation to Ukraine,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
“The training is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be discovered and deployed by counteraction forces,” he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., allow trains to automatically identify and diagnose technical malfunctions, said the representative of the company Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and rolling stock operability.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China's speed”.
In May this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe left the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of the metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport of the city.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China's rail transport equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoxian, Head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Development (CCSMTC).
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-quality equipment in the world market,” Feng Yaoxian said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment production system, with a full range of aids and large - scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxian, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairment, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract mindset.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, said the specialist.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking
“There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheykin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking”, Golosheykin said.
Earlier, a charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years and over.
Doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, which make it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychonergic treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the consultation of doctors created under the Ombudsman, told reporters Georgia.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, character variability,” the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president is necessary send for special rehabilitation.
“We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia,” Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which in There is no Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after he was disciplined by prison officers.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19 took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, Europa Press reported.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action amounted to approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city announced a medical dictatorship, and called vaccination an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Spain has detected more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The government submitted draft laws on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a vaccination certificate or a previous illness, or a medical doctor from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will collect 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute economic development in backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure, landscaping is also being carried out in the region: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still far away.
Justin Downs, adviser on the organization of the Games, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the infrastructure necessary for recreation there be created.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more shops selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Catering points with dishes of national cuisine are opened on the slopes.
Taiva now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China strives to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become the leaders of major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, says WHO
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down human progress in universal access to health services, said the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive tension in health protection systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became more difficult for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have practically no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcasting at Summit for Democracy at the request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan at a panel discussion during the US-organized Summit for Democracy was transferred to a non-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries in the world according to the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted green as “free”, and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - red, as “closed”.
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her part was replaced with a screenshot noting that the opinions of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the US government.”
China was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to the policy of “one China”, which adheres to Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption were donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

You don't need to go in one heap - there are bad people, you may have complaints about them on a specific occasion...
but what does the number of children, age, pension fund and so on have to do with it?
Write that they are “bastards, did not return the money”.
But how many and when they have children is not your business until they are going to hang these children around your neck.
And since this is out of the question, what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, this is only so in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, frankly not giving a damn about existing ones.
What if this also applies to other areas of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
There are no laws written for them.
And what if dad still introduces his own methodology of upbringing and education?
Some kind of horror and an example for others is very bad.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey that we have come with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug against COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may have allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by Sergey Netesov, virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is low, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary,” Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged” invasion” into the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not suffer yourself,” the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov argues that this “understands everyone in the world”.
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank CEO German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results were canceled by 2.99% of the ballots.
The level of participation in voting on that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence has already been held in the region.
Most residents supported the presence of the archipelago within France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, and the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, under which the region can vote on its independence twice, two years apart.

WHO tentatively considers “omicron” less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in case of a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, omicron is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly changed antigenic profile of the protein of the omicron strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it (“the severity of the disease” - ed.) may be less severe than with the “delta”, - said in a technical message WHO.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with “omicron” in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the “delta”.
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered.
They “were previously immunized”, reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that so far there is no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and may also make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko said this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “an ideal storm”, assumes that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development of events will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <... > internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FIGs (financial and industrial groups - Ed.)” , - the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former people's deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of the population who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why it is likely to seize control over the power bloc and implement it” populist initiatives”.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin to “reformat the authorities,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation”.
This can be caused by an event that will be a strong shock for society.
“The event should be large-scale enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
This scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey of the sociological group “Rating” showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for former President Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the President.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, and it is very sad to find out this.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, in real time.
Such intensity of passions, emotions went off scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We were also happy with the rest of the victories, as we rooted for Salnikov, for the players, for all Soviet athletes at that time.
I once saw a documentary on TV about a Central American country, where watermelons were rolled up the ramp aboard the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself worked many times in my youth harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have not seen watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from melons and not earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, underwired.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent cloth.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of sewing the strap, is reinforced with an inelastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of lace can be appreciated thanks to the scallop along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical underwire on the side panels made of single-layer microfiber prevents the fabric from curling on large sizes.

The poet arrested for the rally on Red Square: “For a quote from Yevtushenko, they give 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!”
Earlier this week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #поэтвроссиибольшечемпоэт was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Aliaksandr under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public rally.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of common culture in Russia and also a little hope to inspire unknown poets to write on the Internet your poems under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did police officers treat you during the arrest this time and before?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the employees were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in some context of this word.
Riot policemen took Pushkinskaya and took it hard.
They asked in a standard way, about the motives.
When we heard, in principle, we looked, if not approvingly, then understanding.
Except for the monkey blown on all 4 sides, everything was very correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if at least a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag after the action, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, a transcript is written in the old fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Due to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and if used regularly, it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or cook the root crop, rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-rich foods that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in personal subsidiary plots and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, only imports will be able to replace the shortage of products at the moment.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex search results
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Russian Internet and most of them ceased to exist, says the general director of the Research Institute Karen Ghazaryan.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive due, among other things, to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series Squid Game and Tenderness directed by Anna Melikyan - original series of ivi, the largest video service in Russia (part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty “Encanto”, but judging by the quality of the video, it is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the Univer. 10 Years Later series is available on TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media).

“This idea developed by the Poles” - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only redesigned the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan “Outskirts are not Russia” appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, does not change the essence much.

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces of different softness — high rigidity and slightly more than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs “micro-package”.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals per bed that work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
Micropackage is the most high-frequency of the whole variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coir and natural latex layers are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
This tandem of fillers has long held the status of a classic, as it transmits not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coir provides proper support for the back, latex adapts the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a quilted Aloe Vera knitted cover.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, said on Sunday “Actual Camera”.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability for life of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, it may be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Payusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want something too fatty and harmful anymore.
Of course, we will have traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one makes me eat up everything at once.
You can eat a spoon, try it, and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can cook any delicious and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time, money she needed in training.
And after completing 5 quarter jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that she will not survive 4 years before the next Olympics, that is, she will never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who did not just play sports or can not imagine all the circles of hell that it has gone through, DO NOT MEDDLE WITH CONDEMNATION.
The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, as, in his opinion, such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change turnover.
The coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
According to the expert, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of endless generosity of central banks has already become obsolete” and it is time to return to relations where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department at Otkritie Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and concerns against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is pleasing: if we compare ourselves with ourselves, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, only sluggish.
There is also a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxis that take waste from home.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics Russian Automotive Market Research agencies (NAPI).
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The Hyundai brand, a related Kia, has an even more significant increase - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the leading position in terms of increasing the weighted average price of the car - over the year Hyundai grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan had stronger dynamics of the rise in price, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales from Korean brands did not increase so significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of Automakers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold during the same period, 9.4% more cars than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand increased both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz at the same time has a good increase in sales and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity,” explained Tatyana Arabadji, CEO of NAPI. -
In terms of sales growth rates, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, which also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
In terms of the dynamics of income growth, the Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
At the level of last year, companies whose sales of cars in pieces fell in 2021 are in terms of financial capacity: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is completely in the red - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production that covered the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - AvtoVAZ increased the cost Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers also regularly rewrite the price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially shift to the consumer the costs of previous periods, which they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital for the automotive industry. -
I believe that automakers are doing very well financially now, maintaining high sales margins.”
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which are observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complication of the design of the cars themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the increase in supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to receive their income at the expense of volumes, said independent Sergey Burgazliev, automotive consultant.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now trying to get the greatest profit from each car sold, said Burgazliev. -
An increase in the production of cars is not expected in at least the next six months, while in Russia, the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold at a higher price than the original cost, states expert.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The US leadership has never considered sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of an “invasion” of Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
“There have never been such plans,” the head of the White House said, answering the journalist's question about whether the United States abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more US and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia,” Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in Kiev's combat use of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory.”
I'm leaving such interviews right away.
If during the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible storm and wash another cup, it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without an HR layer, where you immediately talk to your manager.
Promtex-Orient Monolit Combi mattress 16 100x185 cm

Versatility and orthopedic support.
The mattress is suitable for people of different body types and ages.

The mattress is ideal for both a single person and a couple.
The latter will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of a “wave” effect, when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite, disturbing a person in a dream.

If a fraudster, like an “employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” or another law enforcement agency, calls from such a number, then it is ineffective to immediately reset it, and most likely it will not be in time to blacklist it.
Because to confirm his lies about his involvement in law enforcement agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
This is nonsense...
I don't believe it happened like this at all.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
We got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except for the most...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if ours take care of their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
Like in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections...

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, I think you are not in the topic, to put it mildly.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
