In my view, the literature programme was formed by ladies of Balzaki age based on their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilev and Volkonsky.
Of course, they wrote a billletristic from the point of view of the same ladies of Balzaki age.
Psychology and torture of heroes of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for adolescents.

Germany: Fourth coronavirus inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in summer or autumn 2002.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite the active privilege campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine will probably be insufficient for full protection.
This is convinced by the head of the Association of Doctors of General Practice Ulrich Vagelt.
This is reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required in summer, at the latest in autumn", the expert considers.
In addition, Vagelt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with influenza vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, reinforced vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new coronavirus "Omicron".
And the new version of the person is fearful.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infecting Omicronom is three times higher than in Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of the preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Consequently, BioNTech/Pfizer producers plan to provide vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2002.
Companies stress that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against the infection of the new version of Omikron coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that at two doses, the efficiency of the vaccine is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential decreases more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two BNT162b2 doses do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-space infection," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Communicable Diseases Bernd Salzberger advocates for reducing the interval between the second and the third.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the coronavirus omicrone.
"Israel's question shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Wobler Ponton21, Bet A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 m, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib Series is a special branch of Bet-A family from Ponton21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other samples because it was originally created in the light of the use for submarine fishing, not only for catching.
These discharges are larger than those of the analogues close to the dimensions, which certainly have a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper smoothness made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional vibration shades with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter wine" when catching in the Beet-A-Vib waist shows a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most catching is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the particle up-down almost without pause.
When planning a deviation from a vertical axis is not very great, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, refrained by underwater vegetation, corners and other obstacles for which the capture is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching a winter vessel and a large window, especially in the middle of the winter, when a precise and aggressive bait is required.
By reaching the extreme points of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly deploys and returns to the original vertical.
No less successful Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter catching pound trolley.
You can choose from two modifications: noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib plays in the curtain can irritate passive piece, not even reacting to the animal.
When catching, Bet-A-Vib shows the range and accuracy.
This obobler is understood and not captured, well combined with glossy and woven cords even large diameters.
For catching a piece, a sudden, a ersha or a window, except uniformly relevant and a "scale", sometimes with a "scale" on the bottom.
If you catch in the wounded places, you can change the front throne to a double, thereby reducing the probability of corners.
Among the baits of their Beit A-Wib class, one of the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most caught.
With the same success, both on relatively small and relatively deep areas can be used.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya reported 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya there are more than 7,000 private military company mercenaries (FMC) Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the High Council of State of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
"Now there are more than 7,000 CEC mercenaries in Libya, Wagner.
They also have aircraft.
They also spend a tranche in Sirte and Kufr.
They have 30 reactive aircraft on Gardabia aircraft (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," says Anadolu.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were "thinking to capture" the central part of Libya, spreading from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "inducing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save presence
According to the interlocutor, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, uses airbase and port in Sirte, as well as airbase in Jufr, is noted in the Agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the CEC "Wagner" enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where may mercenaries still be
According to the Agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries: CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Angola, Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to those countries," the article states.
Media allegedly claimed that "vagners" had allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group does not mean in the force departments or in the register of irlicit persons, but does not mean in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier 27 EU countries have approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya de facto is the second chamber of Parliament with advisory functions with dominant Islamists, writes TAS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of vote on the election of parliamentarians and heads of State from 24 December to at least February 2002.
"Before the elections, less than two weeks remain, and the chances that they will take place are rapidly declining," the material says.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed an indefinite declaration of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia broadcasts.
Foreign policy by Russian eyes
38% of Russians see in the foreign policy of the country more success than failures, 29 per cent believe that failures are prevailing.
"Examples of success - "in Syria defended, restored peace there", "decisions on the North Stream 2", "the whole world intimidated cool armaments", "We regret Crimea".
The main failures -- "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from peace", -- are stated in the Public Opinion Foundation study.
The Dubai Government has completely refused paper production - all the state services have also become digital only
The Government of Dubai reported a complete denial of paper production and digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the Emirate Information Agency WAM.
"Today, it marked the beginning of a new phase of the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life -- we completed the transition to a completely paperless government", - said the successor Prince of Emirate, chairman of the Executive Board of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al McTum on Saturday.
Now internal and external documentation in all Dubai states will only be digitally processed through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: health, RCC, police, municipal authorities, judges, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the Government's initiative.
The transition to the electronic government and the digitalization of documentation began in Dubai since 2018.
At that time, 36 million paper leaves have been saved by the authorities, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labour and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier Moscow mayor Sergey Sobanin said that electronic services will save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkish car production and exports fell below 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish vehicles declined sharply in November against the background of lira devaluation.
As a result, the industry indicators resulted in a worse last year's result, Blomberg reports, referring to the data of the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 15,000 vehicles were released in Turkey in November, which is 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Some 75.9 thousand machines have been exported, which is more than 25 per cent higher than last year.
And if the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector has shown positive developments by the past year, 1 month of 2021 resulted in car production by 0.3 per cent worse last year.
The result of this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira rate, which in November increased by 29 per cent against the dollar.
This has led to a fall in economic activity in all industries.
More than 50 ISAF entities received deferred credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov described the situation of granting benefits to small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA Kazinform.
"According to the information of the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to the instructions of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the President of the Agency adopted Order No. 127 of April 9, 2021 "On approval of the Procedure for deferring payments on loans of small and medium-sized business entities", Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to the deputy request.
He recalled that the procedure for deferring loans payments included deferral by banks and microfinance organizations of loans issued before 1 April 2021 to ISAF entities, including IPs, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days for the selection of an ISAF entity.
A different deferral period could be specified in the borrower's application.
During the period of delay in relation to the borrower, the claims and claims were suspended, the notification of the necessity of repayment of the delayed arrears, as well as the creditor of the commission and other payments," the premiere noted.
In 2021, the second-level banks received deferral applications for 603 ISAF loans, of which 53 ISAF entities received deferral of 9.7 billion tenge.
IFRS filed deferral applications for 131 ISAF entities, of which deferral was granted to 95 entities in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Purasev assumed that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strains "oxyron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry it easier than those with a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Purasev explained why the strains of the coronavirus "ocmiron" may be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in conditions of birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that oxyrone has been born in the body of HIV or immunodeficiency.
That is, when mutation he found no resistance to immunity.
As a result, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
It seems that he has these bundles, spikes, may have more than laid down, their antibodies have not cut during mutation, - says pulmonologist Sergey Purasev.
The doctor assumed that people with weakened immunity can carry "oxyrone" easier than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
There is a strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens in pneumatic infections when young people are killed for 30 years and older 60 years in the form of cleansing.
The immune response is frustrating from the young, he is quite inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten his finger, he beats, like a gun of works, - concluded Sergey Purasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side events and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Light inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case you can buy only symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will begin to intoxication of the body - it is temperature, weakness, inadequateness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, throat prioritization, cough.
Pain on the right or on the left, abdominal pain can also indicate an evolving problem.
Meanwhile, an irritating generation between 12 and 18 years may begin to vaccinate in Russia until the end of the year.
Virusologist, head of the laboratory of genome engineering MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by the covid.
The number of contacts is maximum for adolescents who go to school.
This is the most socially active area, like kindergartens," said Pavel Volchkov, a virusologist, head of the IFTI genome engineering laboratory.

Immunologists have developed a hypothesis why people with obesity become victims of covida
The authors studied the fatty tissue left from barriatric operations and found that fatty cells known as adipocytes could be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fatty tissue, macrophages also infected, while showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also studied fatty tissue for patients who died of covid and found coronavirus particles in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be washed in fatty tissue, using it as a tank, in attempts to avoid the response of the immune system.
Probably SARS-CoV-2 is able to do so.
The biologist described the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Holoshekin called the causes of dementia and described the ways of its prevention in an interview with Radio Satellite.
According to WHO, more than 5 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested to gradually lose cognitive functions - over time, even in a familiar atmosphere.
Gloshekin noted that most often dementia causes neuropogenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol content, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, the role of factors such as social exclusion and the lack of active cognitive activities can be played," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep violations and low-lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgottenness, inability to concentrate and decrease the level of abstract thinking.
"The discussion will take place that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors of its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of fitting, training cognitive skills and capabilities requiring memory and logic.

Egypt returned about 300,000 artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return approximately 300,000 artifacts that have been illegally withdrawn from the country by smuggling.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel, Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt Shaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2001, 29,300 artifacts have been returned to the Egyptian State.
Only this year, 530 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found in the Bible Museum in Washington,” he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all smuggled artifacts were recorded in the archives.
The department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "trace auctions worldwide and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon return cultural values were restored and then exposed to museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find the auction in London byst Pharaoh Tutanhamon.
Christie's auction house held on July 4 trades at which over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally removed from the Carnacas Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhamon, depicted in the form of the god of the sun Ammon, was kept in a private collection and was not traded since 1985.
How the relics came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported monuments from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggling ancients are the result of archaeological searches for "black digits".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (Cazanese) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkish language group.
FT: Credit Suise wants access to personal staff mobile devices
Credit Suise requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss Bank does not issue corporate communications devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecom operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank enjoys the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member used it to meet a client who was not approved by Credit Suise.
Now, after many staff have moved to remote working mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to resolve working issues.
According to the newspaper, the leadership of the bank has established a deadline before which staff can get acquainted with the new rule.
No new claim information is officially commented on in Credit Suise.

Part 4
The last year of life Sergey Yesenin - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the heaviest for the earthly life of the poet and his "his".
He was already out of any literary associations, dispersed with imaginism, but he is known, demanded by critics, even maliciously, but reading the public is ready to wear it on his hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them - real masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persian motifs", written by the poem "Anna Snegina", issued 8 books, compilation "Rus Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat concluded with Yesenia a treaty to issue it in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovich poets of such honour was achieved, he is the first!
In addition, this sulated very good money - according to the contract the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 30 rubles per month, engineer - 20).
The funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the grandchildren of Lva Tolstoy Sophie Tolstoy, it was necessary to establish a family beat, contain sisters Katty and Sasha, as well as a mother.
Life is likely to be found, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is primarily painted in dark tones, if materialized by the nightmare of the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin):
My friend, my friend,
I am very sick.
I don't know where this pain took.
Whether the wind shines
Above the empty and poor field,
As I grow in September,
It washs the brain alcohol.
Many familiar mentioned that Essenin gave a lot, looks bad, clearly hurt.
Increasingly repeated guns, nervous disruptions.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergei Alexandrovich someone was put, reliable documents were not left.
In May 1923, when Essenin was in tension of the fourth wife, American Asedori Dunkan corrected health in the clinic under Paris with Professor Peter Hanushkin (again, Essenin will fall two years later, already in Moscow).
But here are the testimony of the poets, scandals on this ground, leads to the militia are scattered by dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible novel of the poet with green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend, imaginationist Ivan Startsev.
It was surprising that Yesenin had a very low income in Moscow, neither in Peter, turned to removable apartments, hotels or acquaintances.
Old people remember:
"It came only to night, and in most cases in an unknown state.
Once, returning at four hours in the morning, Essenin fell on the staircase...
When he fell, he scared himself with his face and influenza.
Coming a little in himself, he began coughing continuously, circumcising all the sheep of blood..."
Yes and Esenin himself after the war in Europe and the United States (the dry law was then in the United States, but Duncan captured a decent stock of alcohol) was recognized:
"I didn't see anything there, except kabaki and streets...
I'm at the end and people stopped remembering...
Well, and dust, of course...
And I was drunk because the tusk was scratched."

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers Belarus to use migrants as "arms" against the EU
MID Poland considers Belarus to use migrants as "arms"
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Yablonsky expressed the view that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "arms" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an interview with the newspaper Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus were temporarily "stopped by Lukashenko", but he "is actively searching for new ways".
Also, the Polish official is confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
As the website kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously implemented the fifth sanctions package against Belarus.
He referred to 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they expressed their willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk responded to the food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions on Belarus.

"Not on Senke's hat": when a drunken pijack makes a man mixing
The secular events of 2021 were dominated by drunken pijacs.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Even in September, at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die", he appeared in a drunken raspberry pijaca and traditional "Bondish" grandmother.
The Earthshot Prize was followed twice by Prince William, who first granted the Royal Variety Charity Award ceremony inconsistent with the Royal Dress Code, and after choosing a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety Charity Fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was applied to himself and Lionel Messiah.
Footballer came to take the seventh "Golden Ball" in a drunken pijac Dolce & Gabana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for drunken men's pujacs in Russia.
According to analysts of the service received in Gazetu.Ru, they began to buy 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular warm drums with lining and silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and of course black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively pijaki - sets of suede costumes they choose less.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment of the barhat pijaki this season is represented in almost all brands - both Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model of Gucci, in which he came to one of the premier films "Dom Gucci" by the brand Ambassador Jared Leto.
By choosing pijacs of expensive brands, you can be sure that the barch is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interlaying threads, a dense fabric with a rough external texture and a smooth internal side is obtained.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamide, but are, accordingly, less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Yulia Vahoshkin warns that in the case of a drunken pijack, the main thing is not his model or style, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a pujac is perfect if you gathered for a party or a solemn event," explains Vahoshkin. "He will also come for those cases if the invitation indicates the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion for which compliance allows for choice in favour of a drunken pijac is the status of his buyer.
"The man in a drunken pijac must, first of all, be properly advanced with enough," the authors of the Telegram Channel consider about the male fashion "Krasavchik Bramel". "The owners of drunken pijacs tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to occasional secular events, where there is always a dress code.
Yulia Vahoshkin offers a combination of pujacs made of barhat with the same dressing things: classic trousers with arrows, single-ton shirts, silk halls, brushes, curtains.
Too simple and daily things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from Beauty Bramell are confident: it will be inappropriate and the appearance of an ordinary servant on a corporate in the barch pijack, but if it comes to "the leader of those who refute this event, then "yes", he is such a thing in the topic".
If the servant is lower than the rank and the goal of it is to advance in the complex hierarchy of the company or get financial bonuses, then the best drunken pijac is not to hope.
The guide will exactly evaluate the phrase "not by Senke's hat", - the editors of the TVgram Channel consider men's fashion.

"We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the strengthening of Russia's military power and the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine", the statement states.
The ministers further call on Russia to "relax the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities", as the US President Baden spoke during the video call to the Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandian format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the Ministers for Foreign Affairs also stated.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.

Pfizer vaccine considered to be 32 times less effective from omicron strain
The effectiveness of vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against coronavirus omicrone is 32 times lower than other types of disease.
This conclusion was concluded by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong, transmitted by South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective by studying antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicrone varieties," said Professor Malik Peris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way of protecting against heavy current disease infected with coronavirus.
Earlier London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine scientists predicted development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the omicrone strain.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron scales could cause a new wave of virus circulation and mortality, unless additional measures were taken.
Head of Defence of Ukraine accused FRG of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
Head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine Alexey Reznikov accused the Government of the former FRG Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany put veto on the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that late Berlin has mitigated its position on rifles by recognizing their immortal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
However, the FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrei Melnik expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for the supply of weapons to Berlin at Chancellor Sholts.
According to him, the previous leadership of the FRG explained its refusal to provide arms with a risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas despite Russia's "occupation" of a part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "non-logical" position is assured by the diplomat, Germany will continue with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev is waiting for assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
In Ukraine, they expect Germany to be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense, the President added.
It was also noted that this spring, the Co-Chair of the Green Party of FRG Robert Habek visited the Republic, where he advocated the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

Discover ways to return stolen through online money stores
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by experts on information security in an interview with RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses in the fall of bank card data in the hands of malicious thinkers, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the accumulation can be postponed to the savings account and withdrawed as necessary.
Experts also recommend establishing a separate map for online purchases.
If money was stolen when buying in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"In the framework of the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the participant is responsible for the calculation chain that does not use the service," the representative of Promsvazbank said.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to lodge an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a map on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, transactions can be challenged and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021 1,000 applications were received on various cases of fraud: from selling false documents to theft of personal data.
She said that an effective solution under current circumstances could be to create a single window for online mosquito complaints.
Silz arrived in Poland to discuss North Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Sholz arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the development of Russian troops at the border of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline North Stream-2.
While Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for long years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Moravecki said that he would call on Sholts to oppose the North Stream 2, which is expected to bring Russian gas to Germany to the trade of Ukraine.
According to Moravia, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking to enter Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
However, the Polish judicial system remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the Law and Justice Party violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay a fine and its supreme court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, sworn on Wednesday despite the requirements of Poland and the United States, has not made public obligations to stop the North Stream 2 operation in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told the members of the Congress that they had reached understanding with Germany about the stop of the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, the high-level staff member of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these allegations, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by the representatives of the Big Seven on Sunday.

The cheapest money in the wall of the church of plumbing will pay 20 thousand dollars
Sanitary equipment, which found money in the wall of the church in the American State of Texas, will pay a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the Non-Profit Organization Crime Stopers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osten preachs, promising that religious Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Jastin Kouli plumbing repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages with money and waits under thermal insulation.
He conveyed the finding of the church and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from the Austin.
"I wanted to hear as he said, "You know, Justin, you have done correctly.
We understand what you have done and what could do," quotes CRC-TV.
It seems that the finding is related to theft that took place in the Church of Lakewood seven years ago.
Then about 200,000 dollars were lost in cash and 40,000 dollars in the form of cheques stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.

Discovered full protection scheme against COVID-19
Virusologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honoured Artist of Science of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and applying nasal vaccine.
In the internasal application, a large number of immunoglobulin A is formed. In the administration of the vaccine, this is not injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside after vaccination, we most form immunoglobulin G (antitela).
And if you lead both vaccines, then get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is not yet a double vaccination decision," said the doctor.
The main preventor of UrFO, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of the use of narrow vaccination together with the injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help because in such a case, the protection of the body was expected to become as much as possible.
Earlier, Minister of Health of Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Gusenov said that the new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.

WHO has detected "omicron" in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strains of coronavirus "omicron" had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the dissemination of the new strain may have disastrous consequences.
The rate of distribution was described in the WHO communication.
According to the organization on 9 December, straws have already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is the fact that it has become actively distributed only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of new version of coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strains, according to preliminary data, may spread the strains of the Delta, are the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolute countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebresus, stated that the omicron pace could have a significant impact on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
The number of illnesses in Britain will only be about 1 million. This is the fact that the official "omicron" currently has several hundred people in the Kingdom and estimated to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron straw, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day.
The British health system will not be able to deal with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the vaccine efficiency of Pfizer-BioNTech against the "omicrone" strain is 32 times lower than the other types of disease.
How to respond to the "omicron" of the Russian "Satellite V" so far is unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center only started testing the Russian vaccine at the "omicron" straw.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
Thinkers started looking for new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
This is written by Izvestia with reference to experts.
According to the product director Ivideon Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications means is dipphics.
In this case, fraudulent video is created based on real records with the victim's participation.
Thanks to this, the neurosets can accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behaviour.
Abutalimov added that using a dipphic, malicious thinkers can call a familiar victim by video communication or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for mailing for the purpose of chanting.
"This fraud can easily provoke bulling, since a subjugated malicious thinker can place people in non-lep, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scripts," the expert said.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol in turn noted that psychological people are more trusted by others when they see them.
He stressed that it could create specific risks in the case of video technology.

Doctor Pavlova told about the "migration of the weekend" of workers
The deterioration of suicide in the output may lead to several factors
The reason for the deterioration of suicide after working days is often the "migration of the weekend", said a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, Candidate of Medical Sciences, senior scientist of the Faculty of Basic Medicine of the Ministry of Education, scientific head of the System Medicine Clinic Zuhr Pavlov in his telegram channel.
She said that, especially often, labour workers suffered from headaches, divorce and weaknesses in the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova noted that, in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
In the weekend, our lives are fundamentally changing.
"Sleeping for a long time, all day I lie on the sofa, probably eat more, and the pem less," the doctor argumented. "Owing to the lack of coffee, a small scratch begins.
Due to the transfer and shortage of water, gravity and breakdown."
The late rise plays an additional role.
So, if you get up to three hours later normal, then there will be a reaction called Jetlag.
It arises from travelers who cross several hour belts.
In order to determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in deteriorating self-sensitiveness, Paul recommended that the most severely changing output.

South Africa scientists stated that Pfizer vaccine is lowly effective against "omicrone"
In South Africa, Pfizer vaccine vaccination against "omicrone" was stated
Scientists of the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported low efficiency of Pfizer vaccine against coronavirus omicrone.
It is estimated that (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (verbal) vaccine efficacy of 2.5% against symptoms infections, because ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infections is doubtful, the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.

How many hidden sugar in habitual products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its surplus in diet can lead to second type diabetes, as well as to cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that a hidden sugar ingredient similar to calorie, composition and glycemic index may be indicated under the unfamiliar word in the product.
Several dozen names can be presented on the label, namely sugar.
One of the most common and frequent names is glucose and fruit.
Other sugars, such as dextrosis (sugar, corn), levulose (fruct sugar), melasa (black heel), agavi syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that relate to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctoral collbase, bread, etc.
As stated in Christmas, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and rough products, as well as to draw attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how called the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or processed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar because it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total number of sugar can be significantly higher than the label.
Germany Scholz Chancellor: Gas Loses Importance for FRG 25 Years ago
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that imports of gas are of importance to Germany, as the country continues to move to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"This is a 25-year-old world that the issue of gas transportation to FRG and Europe will play a different role," Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continued to remain committed to transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at present this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement that recorded support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, Head of the German Foreign Ministry Analena Berbok stated that the process of certification of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline "not yet complies with the requirements" of the European Union.

At the New Caledonia referendum, the majority voted against independence
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonia's inhabitants voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to the preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) voted for New Caledonia's independence, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The Java was 43.90%, with over 800,000 New Caledonia residents participating in the elections.
As these interim outcomes of the French Press Agency comment, "the outcome of these elections did not leave doubts", since the supporters of independence called for voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevented a full and "fair" electoral campaign.
This failure thus opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of the French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and challenge them at the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, at the Palace of Elisea, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak after the referendum.
The theme of the independence of New Caledonia has revitalized many recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates were in favour of the remaining territory of France, since it was a "last region of European Union presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemur repeatedly.
The same statement was made by the Candidate of the Republicans Valery Pekres, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not occupy the position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "the strong desire for the choice of Caledonians to be the choice of France".
Light, oh, hello!
I'm a little... a lot of hurt, still no hurt, stubborn.

On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military pilots began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defence Ministry concluded an agreement on construction in the Kiev region of the center in which staff training will be conducted, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions fled at the airport from the container
At Singapore airport Changi ran lions.
The Straits Times reports this.
Two predators were able to choose from a container with seven lions arriving on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they have brought to Singapore and where they have been sent.
One of the white Lvivs smooths on the roof of the container.
The animals could not be withdrawn from him because of a number of protective mesh installed.
The opposition ended after the arrival at Mandai Wildlife Group airport, leading all Singapore zoos.
They deprived Lviv with the help of wires with a tranquillizer and plan to deliver them to the quarantine institution.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the owner and walked around the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people did not suffer.
Specialists warned about the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people without folic acid failure less risk of disturbing certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, excessive dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Bet Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 40 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is significantly deviated from this figure to a large or smaller side.
Childhood recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, necessarily monitor the dosage and avoid cotton with milk and other food products containing foil acid.
Rachel Fan's food consultant called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it is contained in avocado, among other things, Fan recommended that men after 50 years more frequently have this fruit.
In the UK by April, about 75,000 people may die due to omicron steam
Projections from British scientists show that the spread of coronavirus omicrone in the coming five months in England may die up to 75,000 people unless restrictive winter measures are tightened.
This was reported by The Guardian with reference to the study of experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TAS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific and Advisory Group on Emergency Situations in the British Cabinet, by April 2002 at least 25,000 mortals of omicron straw will be recorded in the country and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
More than 2,000 infected people will be taken daily at the peak of hospital morbidity.
"Great measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the omicron pace is more contagious than the delta variant, and the existing vaccines will not be able to exclude infection," said Rozana Barnard of LSHTM mathematics.
Earlier, the British Health Security Agency informed: if the rate of omicron scale remains at the current level, approximately 1 million infections will be detected by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, omicron strains can become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of omicrone coronavirus infection have been detected in Britain, 63 of which have been detected in recent days.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sadjid Javid, said that in reality, this figure could already reach 100,000 cases.
I wanted to write some reasonable comments, but I read here before that place:

The demand for superachts rose worldwide by fourth
The construction of superachts this year and orders for the next year to be all records in the world despite calls to reduce hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of vessels, the number of yachts ordered was 120 units, fourth more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people wishing and money on the floating fortress for Pound50 million and above will not be reduced, says Gardian.
However, they are becoming increasing.
This year, 25 per cent of vessels were ordered more than in the previous year.
Brokers say that such an agiotage on the market was not 20 years old.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners personally, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted in winter.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that ships accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are ready to pay more, only their yacht would be ready for at least one year or two before.
"People simply want freedom, and the superrich could afford her," he said.
In Western society, many criticize such behaviour and call it decadent.
Rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that during times of deprivation of travel to outer space, life on yachts or flight on their own planes cause irritation in society, since elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all other humankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for superrich, although they understand that, with such mobility, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, only the number of ordered super yachts is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 120 vessels, 27 have a length of feed above 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire of the River builds the REV Ocean yacht with a length of 183 meters.
After descent to water, this will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht includes a sunny swimming pool, as well as an underwater boat designed to explore sea depths.
On existing super yachts ordinary steel helicopters, open-air cinemas, and some of them, such as the yacht of the fighter McGregora - a platform for uniforms.Professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas electors, carbon traces produced by super rich, are small.
But it is symbolic if it takes into account that multi-milliarders in the world are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of excess consumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists found that the emissions of billionaires are thousands of times more than the medium-sized inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 3.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trace were hidden on his Eclipse yacht of 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the team a yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of the superachts do not cause the sympathy of others when they, as the richest Australian woman, Gina Ranhard, owned by mines on the continent, complain through Itub that there is no place for their giant vessels to harvest.
It is also difficult to understand its call to build marines for vessels mixing 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to intestinal cancer has been defined
American scientists have determined what amount of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer development.
This is written by Daily Express.
Specialists concluded that the use of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages per week was attributable to increased risk of oncology development.
At the same time, the likelihood of the disease increases with an increase in the number of alcohol used.
Moreover, the risk of intestinal cancer is higher in moderate men than in women.
The exact reason for the development of such a type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not guess how quadrennial pets are actually developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to probably learn how to develop intelligence in animals.
Although the dictionary stock of the dog is not as extensive as human, but a new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or make things, nothing senses in politics, economics and art, but they often manage to define their own owners.
Representatives of some species consider experts to show the best results in understanding the words of human language, but statistics are still insufficient for accurate conclusions.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered to be doggy genius - for example, labradors.
The scientists concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn does not assign a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The USA and Russia will "trade" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on United States guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance despite the words of American leader Joe Baden on the right to join anywhere.
If you offer something well-knownly unacceptable, well, for example, sell a close relative to sexual slavery, you will not be traded, but simply send the suggestor.
And for Ukraine there is a bid," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but strives for dialogue with Kiev.
"The training is carried out in a hidden, rapid and immediate manner to move to offensive acts rather than wait until the group finds and deploys forces of opposition," he said.
China stimulates rail transport industry development
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition 2021, held in Zhongzhou Province of Junan /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, the representative of Hou Zhaoven said.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was operational at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, thus ensuring increased reliability and mobile capacity.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of railway vehicles and many Asian and European countries are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May this year, CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co.,Ltd met the first two-storey electric trains developed in China to export to Europe.
At the maximum working speed of 20 kilometres per hour, these trains will be trained on railways Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train, developed by the company for Turkey, began.
The train will be moved through the metropolitan connecting the center of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
The Metro Movement will be open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
"The Chinese Rail Transport Equipment Industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitiveness," said Fen Yaosan, Head of the Trade and Investment Department of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-quality equipment in the world market," said Fen Yaosan.
After more than 60 years of tension, having conducted a number of independent research and developments, China has established an advanced system of production of rail transport equipment, with a full range of support equipment and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosana, the country is the first to electrify railways and operate on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Holoshekin in an interview with Radio Satellite listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgotten, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduce abstract thinking.
The discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, the expert said.
Glochekin stressed that the causes of dementia may be non-generative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, shortage of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and brain vessel atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.
It is therefore necessary to start preventing it in time.
According to him, the risk of dementia development will help learning foreign languages and active communication.
Also, WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still discussed in the scientific community," said Gloshekin.
"World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies requiring intensive memory and thinking logic", said Gloshekin.
Previously, a charitable dementia research organization in Britain stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40.
Medicines called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first disturbing sign can be considered visual problems, due to which the patient becomes complex in the recognition of objects.
Another sign of developing weaknesses, specialists called aphasia - a state when a person cannot find the right words to pass on what he wants to say.
Neurologist needed to send Sakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychotherapy and rehabilitation abroad, said the journalist Otar Toidze, a neurologist who is part of the doctor's consensus established under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Sakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are movement, coordination, variability," the expert said, noting that this is not going beyond the regulatory framework and now the former president needs to go for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychotherapy, which we did not find in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
In the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after the staff of the prison service subjected to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy was rapidly able to abolish punishment and restore itself in previous rights.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have been held, the Europa Press Agency submits.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for hiking to bars, restaurants, gyms, elderly homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many manifestants came to action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism by losing their posters and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entertainment facilities and restaurants of more than 500 people.
Protests in the city reported medical dictatorship and vaccinations were called experimental.
More than 5.2 million coronavirus infections have been detected in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, with over 8,000 deaths.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on non-vaccinated persons.
The Government introduced draft laws on a single QR code system on 12 November in the State Duma.
Russians are expected to be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail with either a certificate of vaccination or transferred disease or vaccination bearing.
The same rules will be established for train and aircraft travel.

Round rise: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympiad should attract millions of people to the inclination and help create international resorts in the country
China hoped that the Olympiad would not only attract 30 million citizens to winter sports activities, which would allow President Xi Jinping to gather 1 trillion of Yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of the remote provinces.
The Tavu ski resort in Zhangzakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening work is also carried out: working trees are cut off.
There are more than 70 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangzakou, there are snow problems.
The main task in the long term is to provide comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts, so that all beginners become forever.
However, it is still far.
Justin Downs Counsellor said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to unrecognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, snowboarding from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
Those regions still need to develop actively and create the infrastructure necessary for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao McCong lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chongli, they carried out a speed railway, now no local resident suffers without work.
There are more and more shops that trade clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of hospitality with dishes of national cuisine.
There is now even a COVID-19 test station on Tavu.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 50 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO stated
More than 50 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which hampered human progress in universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) stated.
In connection with the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Services, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had caused malfunctions in the provision of health services, and had caused excessive tensions in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years immunization has decreased, tuberculosis and malaria mortality has increased.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic had caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people were more difficult to pay for treatment".
This situation pushes more than 50 million people "to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guteriš stated that the coronavirus pandemic had committed more than 10 million people to poverty, almost four billion people lacked social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister dismissed broadcasting on the Samit for Democracy at the request of the White House
The statement by the Minister of Digital Technologies, Taiwan Odry Tan, during a panel discussion during the US-organized Samita for Democracy, was transferred to a video-free mode, shows the recording of the YouTube Summit.
The Reuters Agency, referring to sources, claims that the picture was disabled upon request of the White House.
According to them, a map on which Taiwan was allocated separately from the PRC considering the island of its territory was the reason.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the world in the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was allocated green as "free", while China, DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam were red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenshot, noting that the views of the panellists "not necessarily express the position of the US Government".
The People's Republic of China was not invited to "Samit for Democracy".
The sources of Reuters note that the map shown by the Taiwan Minister could contradict the "one China" policy followed by Washington.
One source of the agency stated that after the map demonstration, the US National Security Council angryly contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing it by Taiwan a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from 9 to 10 December involving representatives of 10 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, the editor-in-chief of the "New Newspaper" Dmitry Muratov called for the establishment of an international fund, through which the money obtained through corruption was given for charity.
Earlier today, Yuri Averanov, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation, stated that the summit has a "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

China strengthens the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land passages are located
A joint mechanism for preventing and controlling the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular ordering to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land passages are located to further prevent the import of infections from abroad.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs talked about the "peal conclusion" between Russia and the United States
Sergey Rabkov, Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, assessed the prospects of Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
On the one hand, there is a negative predictability, but in some perspective of improving relations, everything is absolutely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long way we have both passed with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems started not yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Rabkov, the problems related to the USA's desire to impose approaches on many issues.
MID Heads added that they would not risk providing optimistic forecasts on prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress was not observed.
Russia, however, calls upon the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of a healthy sense.
Earlier, Head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
COVID-19 may have an allergy and need medical assistance, so the first points for attracting this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TAS virusologist, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, owner of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virusology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points at airports and shopping centres, but I would do so first only in medical facilities.
The fact that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small but desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's cabin.
Doctors have special sets of anti-alergic drugs that operate literally in a minute to two, which sometimes is very necessary," Netesov said.
In the opinion of a virusologist, thinking about vaccination in shopping centres will be possible when experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that it was important for the use of the nasal vaccine to fall on the mucous membrane in the nose.
At the same time, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the nose injected after injection is crushed.

1,239 cases of coronavirus omicrone per day recorded in the UK in Russian
A total of 1,239 new coronavirus omicrone infections have been detected in the UK per day.
This is informed by Sky News.
In particular, 196 new omicrone cases were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variety of infections in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 diseases from the new strain in Great Britain reached 3,137.

Sand warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" on the territory of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions on Russia and not suffer the most," said the official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the Russian TV channel "Russia 1".
Sand claims that this "understood everything in the world".
Earlier it was reported that the United States considered the possibility of imposing anti-Russian energy sanctions as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will complicate the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of the Sberbank German Greef is sure that it is impossible.

New Caledonia residents rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5 per cent of the votes voted against independence.
3.51 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported France's independence.
Results of 2.9% of ballot papers were cancelled.
The voting level on this day was very low: about 5 per cent of the population of the archipelago came to the sites.
In the opinion of experts, the low appearance is due to the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum date.
In October 2020, New Caledonia residents opposed France's independence at a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is located nearly 200,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853 France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Archipelago lives around 270 thousand people, the territory has special administrative and territorial status.
There is an 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia Administration that the region can vote twice with a biennial difference.

WHO pre-deems "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "omicrone" is less dangerous than coronavirus delta.
However, there are data on reducing the effectiveness of vaccines in diseases by the new COVID-19 option.
According to information on 9 December, the "omicron" was registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly modified antigen protein profile "omicron" suggest reducing vaccine efficiency against infection and transmission of the option.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is expected to be less severe than in the "delte" technical communication of WHO.
The organization notes that all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are still occurring easily or without symptoms.
However, the new strains, according to preliminary data, are distributed rapidly.
Two cases of omicron-space infection have been recorded in Russia.
They were "earlier immunized", the Gamalei Center reported.
Anna Popova, Head of Rospotrebnadzor, stated that there is still no reliable data that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2002.
In his view, the Head of State may remain without the support of the West, as well as perhaps a compromise on the Donbass.
This on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told in the publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching agreement on the future without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the profound crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export "..." internal protests and confrontation of power with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups...)" added ex-parliamentarians.
According to Denisenko, there is also another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will be expected in the event of high turbulence in world politics, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine can compromise on the Donbas, as a result of which the internal confrontation may be possible.
At the end of summer Zelensky position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50-5%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of disagreements with the Green Groups and the President, which is believed to take control of the force bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
During this variant of the crisis Zelensky will start "reforming power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into a "father of the nation".
This can lead to a certain event that will become a strong shock for society.
"The event should be sufficiently large in order to cause reactions from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine", Denisenko said.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic disaster or aggressive action by Russia, the former deputy considers.
At the same time, the Russian side has not once rejected any probability of "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that increase military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, November 11, the survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low value of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his head of State was elected.
Analysts predicted a situation in which only 21.8% would vote in the event of the immediate elections of the President of Ukraine for Zelensky, while 14.5% for former President Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3 per cent of the President's support was expressed among all interviewed.

Arrested for the action on the Red Square of the poet: "For the quote of Evtushenko 10 days give, here she, power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenko was arrested for ten days.
The student of VŠE was arrested at the Red Square with a poster, on which the hatcheg #poetrosympoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writers Evgeniy Evtushenko.
Alexander had drawn up a protocol on an administrative article on a re-infringement of public action.
He was first detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexey Naval.
"The goal was to draw attention to the poetry as a whole, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the culture common in Russia and the same little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poets on the Internet under this hate," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How did you contact police officers this time and earlier?
What did you ask in the department, how did you comment on your share?
This time the staff were more correct, detained as much as possible, polite as possible in some context of the word.
At Pushkin they took UNOMS and took hard.
They asked standardly about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not endorsing, understood.
With the exception of the 4 sides of the defender, everything was very correct, but I knew what was going on.
And if after the actions under this haste start writing their poems, at least a few people, I will dream these 10 days not visual.

Researchers told how potatoes help in combating age disorders
The study revealed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements, which help to improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The roots contain vitamins of groups B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, foil and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help to function the systems of the body.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age disorders.
Due to the large content of the cell, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most useful root fruit is better to stew or cook, not to heat on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetes like other products with high glycemic indicators.
These are carbohydrates that quickly fluctuate on sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned about the possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in personal sub-economies and an increase in manufacturing capacity.
In the opinion of market participants, the product deficit will now be able to replace only imports.

Estonian scientists will seek life in Venice
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venice to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday the "Actual Chamber".
The aim of the five-year missions is to evaluate the suitability for the life of the Venice clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in Venice clouds.
To date, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venice, nearest to the Earth of the planet, are too acid to exist there, but probably originally Venice was a planet of earth type.
During the third mission, the sample should arrive with Venice.
We assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like the earth or different.
If it seems very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life has not started on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Michkel Paisalu.

Meta-settlement will change Russian business
The topic of the meta populated became a popular autumn of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was turned into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.

British economist was unable to provide projections for 2002
The British economist Jim O'Nil was unable to project 2002, since he believed that such attempts would turn into a failure.
He wrote about this in the article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and secondly, inflation, he believes.
O'Nil also recognized that he did not know whether the price increase was temporary or not.
As the expert said, it was clear before the pandemic that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already survived" and it is time to return to relations where interest rates based on inflation will correlate to the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Nil noted that, against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of super-soft economic policies could, in some experts' view, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as poverty and climate change, O'Nil summarized.
Michael Schulgin, Head of the Global Investment Opening Division, previously reported that positive dollar expectations for 2002 remained, with growth potential less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin referred to the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the coronavirus pandemic.

I believe that in financial terms auto manufacturers feel very well now, supporting high marginality of sales."
The indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of vehicles observed during 2021, prices for new vehicles are growing faster inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow in quantitative terms, and in cash, but mainly due to inflation and complications in the construction of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With increased supply opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the future year, even if the cost of the car is slowed, the auto manufacturers will be able to obtain their revenue from volumes, says the independent consultant for the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.

Against the background of the market situation, cars were a good investment object - the car purchased year ago, even with the pass, can now be sell more expensive initial cost, the expert notes.
