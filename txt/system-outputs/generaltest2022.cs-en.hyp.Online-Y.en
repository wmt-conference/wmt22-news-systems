The big return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Frenchz has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Frenchz, who has been going through a difficult time in his career in recent months, is heading back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the turn and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk got injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas he alternated, and as of this time he has not yet presented himself on the NHL rinks.
The incident happened at the moment the experienced goalkeeper was shifting from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Frenchman will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in his lower body,” announced the entirety from Denver in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was summoned from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he credited 94,5% of interventions.
The breeding of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year and did not catch a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL “Francík” caught 36 games, his success rate is 92,3%.
Charles puts on Camille's drape at Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate selected a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, who used a photograph showing his consort Camille at horse races helping to put on a drape.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on this.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
Photography originated somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki-coloured summer dress, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, nor is it clear exactly when it originated.
Last year, for a photograph intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a straw bale in front of a pile of wood at their country mansion in the county of Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also posted by heir to the throne Prince Charles and wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at horse racing in Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat on his head and a drape on his face, helps Camille put on her colour-matched drape with the bright dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague — Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have promised one million crowns from Slavia in Prague league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about this, saying that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice Club, stated that the red-white men did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly figures its former sports director Jan Nesmar, who finished at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is in the case also among the accused.
The CSI allegedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward for when he got his degree.
2019 SK Slavia Prague won the First League title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to have promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha from the officials of SK Slavia Prague, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nesmar, but also with the chairman of the board Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer implies whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The contestant denied any corruption conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the proportions in Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed unlawful conduct, sought to influence referees in breach of fair play rules and have not granted any financial performance to anyone in this context,” it said Told for List Messages.
In intercepts, among other things, Nejmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's dark-skinned former players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was unleashed by a police crackdown in several places including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR last mid-October.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of football's functions.
In mid-January, he, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen must from the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover already managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold-war, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
Honitbu's right next to town.
They were climbing nutria out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the river bank.
I didn't want to mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course a fox went in a while.
I let her come to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
Poor fisherman nearly shat himself, waved his headband on all sides, so I called out to him it was on fox.
Before I got out of the sit-down, he was down.
I.e. I meadow man be pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably see in the thermal imaging that almost everyone is today.
So in a visible place, dear stuff you dat to noham in the spacak and you should be fine with your apartment.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Intraro got hold of respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy the runway?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the server iRozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which were done by older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be taken up by training, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover modern technology is still more complex, so The skills of the reservists will rapidly lose in time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to practice someone again.
And in the end, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it goes to lead a mass gerilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to remove the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where geril will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography for this.
mainly we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they have one.
Then there is such a situation that you watch a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes back, goes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 swiss and you're like “tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?”.
Well, of course they're gonna make him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this “flood your defender” skill is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to play one player of the opponent.
First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting some major reversal for the weeks ahead.
The onslaught in hospitals according to statistical models will last some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known, the omikron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to which vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous disease helps against it.
But this week an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 per cent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the incoming medicines is here administration ready.
As it was said, Merck's molnupiravir reaches domestic patients first.
The company ended up on tape first even because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatments for equine viral disease in South America of the continent.
What's often neglected with this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking “how our beak grew.”
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you that no.
In the West they tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist crap.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
Afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they actually find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the spin of units, so that soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory whether for safety or the speed of deployment of warheads because of a more westerly position.
In those underground enclosures (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire rocket as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived and retrieved this warhead and mounted it on some kind of carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, there are those left in a desolate state.
At the second level of primary school we had a classmate of Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to make a light, missed a little, went regularly, did sports with us, did not steal snacks, or phones, walked cleanly clad.
He went to schools in nature, did various monkey shops, but he was cool, perhaps never any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings joined, cigans to the same grade, different grades.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, often dealt with something by the police there, threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sell sometimes something on an ad (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and I sold often to Ciganas, money always had, did not try to make any attempts to stretch me on price, communication in tranquility.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month saying he had already rewritten it on himself..
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise as long as they behave the way they belong in a decent society (works, works, doesn't beat women, simply common behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, outlets apartments and houses, he just has a mess around him, makes trouble.. so it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs too.
Young woman died in car crash on Prachatick
“The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene,” Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unidentified reasons, drove out in a bend into the opposite direction.
After colliding with Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the roadway, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the crash.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his discharge, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was transported to the hospital in České Budějovice by air, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered a lighter chest injury and was rushed to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often fail to supply details about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly acquires collectible cards.
“Typically, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly expensive, and now he has to add VAT and the post office hand over the data to the customs procedure.
An email arrives to him, telling him that customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader already at the sale, the customs office will rate it out of the total amount for the consignment and transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's mostly a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments manage to deliver smoothly, though.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad decreased from 60 thousand to 15 thousand at the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30 thousand shipments in the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data needed and filled them in on time, we would be about half of it here, says Matyáš Vitík, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should be doing to slow, or compensate for that growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it rushes?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford regular things, mainly energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I got added 2% in gross this year, which is a travesty, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists put themselves behind bars for maybe only 6 months?
This just doesn't take away my head, how a court can only send an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for a few years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And that's not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
Grave man 'burnt' his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The Grave man inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her himself.
But he went a round of it.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not enough to wonder when the alleged “robbed” told them that he had made everything up to allow officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the constables on how to file the notification to the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers then discover that the woman is on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant is placed on her.
The case is therefore handled by the Czech Republic.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally Slavs since, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme, too bad Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well I don't know, it's quite a question whether or not a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that there is at least one god in any of those thousands of religions that will punish you unnicely if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no god but Yahweh.
So it wouldn't be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god than to risk picking the wrong way out of those thousands of gods and that one real god I didn't exactly hit me for this he sends to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model, I suspect, is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If one would do well then he can get a pro offer.
All the files of the Czech Republic could use something like that.
You could do this in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly getting ready, companies are hunting in schools and a kind of intermingling takes place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions into employment relations.
Not only in adolescence, but this process happens constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian raider will never break in again.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and so they will defend us if we get in trouble.
Well, please the frying pan.
All it takes is one election in the US that will twist their budget and all NATO goes into a screw.
The Anglans will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown once that just show them their backs and take whatever they want.
The only thing that has been a guarantor of independence for a long time is the armed army and the population who can master military equipment of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what could not be.
We don't need a border fortification, that sucks today, but the charmed teenager behind the remote control device book can do it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home wrapped with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved shop (the map of the KamsNim.cz project contains nearly 150 of them).
This will encourage small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market and also the money saved, as packaging cardboard has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics, is also one such store.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who are accumulated at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular cartons.
We use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more respectful world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to the next generations, says Petra Lopushníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KamsNim.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, high volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would be otherwise unnecessarily become waste”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Utidy Czechia association.
It seems bad to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and crapproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computing skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because like Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and bend everything on one screen in the app.
Feel free to use the technique since childhood, but especially let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron set out the priorities of France's EU presidency before the weekend — starting in January — and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for Europeans to be protected — at work, on the street — and mentioned so many events that they can't be made in half a year.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it too.
Macron's supporters, straddling the right and the left, agree on a few, but Europe does.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar affected priorities themselves as well.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe”, and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed criticisms that Macron was about pro-European propaganda and was rewriting history.
In fact, it's trying to defend the rewriting of history.
Far-right candidate for French president Éric Zemmour is hugging France right now with the thesis that the Vichy regime that collapsed with Hitler in World War II wasn't so bad, and has quite a bit of success with that with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries learn history as an us versus them story and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech “Mice” did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for director and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held on to the first rungs of the audience chart.
The best actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like “having the flu/being stuffed” I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to regular flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with flu.
(Personal experience only. I don't say everyone has it that way)

Those who stayed, and those who left, know too little about each other to venture out on a life together.
Trains start running according to new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the time of departure is adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Ticket sales started by carriers already during the fall.
Czech Railways plans to make an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Runways alongside domestic connections under the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The firm will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains of the carrier will travel in North Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Runways factor inflation into their fares annually.
The biggest change in the timetable of the RegioJET is the entrance to line R23 Ústí nad Labem — Mělník — Nymburk — Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Daily, RegioJet will make a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two return services to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Kraków.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar travel times of its long-distance trains as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arrivy trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the single rail fare for the second year running.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and they had to nap, dying.
I haven't heard teaching in my life from the perspective of the slave party or from that era, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
Nobody even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
Nobody will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I spent some time in the US too, right in schools, both in the more northern schools and the Southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately obfuscating the facts, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (like in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was more likely that history isn't black and white, and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way while we're at those Southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand they too had some good successes and I found it absurd to repudding them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better, as enough people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was slave owners, and a lot of things went wrong with them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view doesn't exist (there was a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our Legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was appalling, those students were pretty radicalised and those schools supported them in it as many times.
And if I imagine these people are going to be a lot older someday, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the vote of the majority, because among the young it is and in the ruling elite as well.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it's not about the same anymore, it's radicalized.
At present, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological fact, so other groups like LGBT and it leads to radicalization even to the opposite side where it often leads to a backlash even for pretty reasonable things.
Plus the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I was more likely to encounter the wrong geography, that was but ambidextroduct:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because that, I think, is completely groundless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Furthermore, I find the concept of nationality overall useless in terms of some personal identity.
If something has me with people, interests, worldviews and common experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak pastor is an awfully fine guy, he has a sermon more about theology than politics, but then he always discards some cocootine about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services to the Hussites because it's a lot like theologically, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michala in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00pm they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav — Plamínek sparked in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna because of the coronavirus pandemic, but even this time they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal — Břeclav.
They took it on the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the troop and I participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, Scout Amalie Budíková told the journalists present.
Whereas last year the transfer took place at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the crossing Reintal — Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually for him, though, scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes about the delivery of flame around the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the Scouts traditionally travelled by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday 18 December by scout couriers who will travel by selected speeders and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in stations, who will then continue to spread flames around the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going on similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events, to wear drape, of course, try to observe spacing, there were as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just behave In order to make it as safe as possible, the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light Action, Zuzana Hrbková, described.
The tradition of Bethlehem light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies overall.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it hacks the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I work in a factory where there are a million “xy funded/co-financed by project xy” message boards in the corridors, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is a brake on development when this company both sticks and takes orders/employees to companies that could grow and be after its demise more productive
Total consent, it's horrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet era also gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet ads don't move with me, but then I catch on anyway, that they also affected me - it's just so messed up that a person doesn't always resist it.
For that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of a classic - I would ban those internets.

TVs have plummeted the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles — Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, giving their viewers a premiere this year will present a record of more than two hundred.
It was calculated by movie database operator IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring in the audience in recent years and significantly increases viewership, therefore more and more of these films are being created.
Four times as many Christmas films have been made this year than in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will be much more holiday movies in real life.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are especially fairy tales associated with this period; globally popular are also the films Home Alone, Love Heavenly or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the true boom in Christmas pictures kicked off only in 2009, when the US cable TV station Hallmark came with a special film series, recalled the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
“In this magical period, the story does not matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies).
'For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way for at least two hours to feel a bit of peace amid all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years, 'he added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for his films, which, while uniform, is successful.
You have two people falling in love with each other, but then some misunderstanding arises about half an hour before the end, which will be resolved and the two kiss.
It's been like this over and over, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar vibe, people watch one after another, complements Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he won't hit the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he took in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Priz after all.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, from the last rung Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will be in a direct battle for the title Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin, according to the observations of the Haas stable, is quite fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders,” its representatives for formula1.com said.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can he.
A possible alternate would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not faced with the first competitor.
At the start of the just ending season Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19, last year Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton tested positive.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters were never worn much,” admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in half a year.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
Silver stars then adorned with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has one more catch.
“I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
To date, the most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 kronor.

The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Sappers, scouts and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states, in connection with the months long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries into its territory with a false promise easy crossing of the Union border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
The Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is looking into another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov primary school is not proven,” Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the county in the week.
“We continue to wait for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases — it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Nonspray Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” she said headmistress.
She added that they are two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four have a symptomless course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron travelled abroad
None of those listed have travelled abroad, nor has any of their families, nor has there been contact with anyone residing abroad.
The connection with the water polo championship is none of those listed, Ciupek said.
Pavla Svrčinová, the chief hygienist, said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was being checked.
Players from South Africa were also on it, and one Belgian player fell ill upon his return.
California will limit gun sales.
He wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state with the help of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its a controversial law against abortion performed after embryo heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's opinion by the US supreme court that left the Texas abortion ban in place, even if it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US at roughly 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court now ruled not on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Indeed, enforcement of the ban was delegated to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial route.
“I am outraged by yesterday (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which authorized the retention of Texas's ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver with aim to protect his law,” the California governor stated.
“If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work, in conjunction with the state parliament and the justice minister, on a measure that would entitle representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made guns that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to require at least $10,000 (over $220,000) in compensation and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell in California assault rifles, components to “ghost weapons” or kits for their manufacture.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do,” the California governor stated.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some Army-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state now actually reinstates the ban using a Texas template, the words of liberal supreme court member Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on Friday would be confirmed The majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas's abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against select officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where we gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect mentioned by you.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule over time, only it's too soon for that time.
Another fact is that in not long a new vaccine should come to the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x more efficiency.

Poland threatened to halt payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in breach of law if it used the new powers and halted the payment of money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund to rebuild economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should answer this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes it would the current government lost its tight majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from a common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes undergone by the Polish justice under Ziobrova's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is constructing “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces “political diktat carried out by blackmail and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic by control.
He said his party would never accede to such concessions to Brussels, which would see Poland's sovereignty curtailed.
“We will never agree to Poland having colony status,” he declared.
But to confess it... At our place in Lidl they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for the other things, I met one yogurt more than once, all I needed was cheese, parmesan cheese, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's an evasion, I don't even smelt into any market anymore, non-action action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years watching data being treated here like manure, most vaccination opponents are just a little more out of the bowl than most vaccination advocates.
Rational discussion is taking place at expert level, but only extreme views reach the public space.
Constantly wall-to-wall.
Binary considered: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states no one addresses.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon in my childhood.
It was never due to grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (read instead of going to bed, fighting my bro etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next “catching” of the cooktop only brought and laid so that I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I received a few bum blows (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child reacts to them far more than they do to words.
What's important, I think, is the part with the warning, because it gives the child, in a way, the choice of disobeying and getting, or getting better and the punishment won't.
In the end, most of the time all it took was a warning to start listening
Defense of the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic inquiry in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him — whether the sacred charter to which he is sworn and about which from teaching at school or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely lean to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens and, with changes, are better to conserve them.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have predicted, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be premeditated.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have met across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set politicians with the mantinels of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with bans.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to give their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fighting for life of several months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with lately.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” the chief of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Faculty told News Brno Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The course is considerably simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which is what we see especially in the last period,” added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
The latter takes place in the clinic of pediatric infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are up to the ARU recently.
Children with postcovid syndromes were continuously in the department according to the doctor throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease strikes next to adults as adolescents , as well as several months-long babies.
In hospitals there are even children in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“At present, a child of several months and adolescent age lies with us,” the chief mayor said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded at the Children's Hospital FN Brno so far from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years occurred in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in the children's hospital — not just the coronavirus ward — an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“Therefore, the application of the vaccination dose is also recommended in children,” the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But those rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the fields).
Skiing/cycling in the woods outside marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it's not so much guarded outside national parks).
How does the conductor train?
Music goes in my head, Josef Elector laughs.
He is unsuckled by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only at the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra or the Podkrkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China builds impression of managed contagion and that authoritarian regime faces crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime faces a crisis better.
China has gone on both medical and political offensives.
A couple of months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increment of infected.
Countries including the Czech Republic compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, such as in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and says to him: hey don't you want an elephant?
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because he grasses the grass, the car washes with his trunk, the children play with him.
Well, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: Okay, let's slap, that's gonna be great...
After some time, they meet and the guy who bought complains: you dude who sold that for an elephant????
Lawn unraveled, giant poop everywhere, car unraveled, kids fight him and wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold says, you're talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the superpowers that set the course for international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
The latter works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be 10 or 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will lead.
It struck me too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'll have a word.
I'm just proceeding from the fact that the ellipsis mostly involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and tangerines”, when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas “Spanish fruit and mandarin” is no longer clear in tangerines, that they're from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads “all US forces” thus including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So, in other words, I expect that this is already covered in that broad term and there is no need to specify it further with US forces.
But again, maybe just a word of words:D
Either way, it's a meaningless requirement

Britain's Vicki Holland tortured cosman monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed it off.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebab and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her mistreatment said they had never seen such a frightened cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now contentedly playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence at Gwent Magistrates' Court, with a suspended suspension of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay in recalculation 12,000 kroner court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further. “
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement prompted her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new humans can still create panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered terrifying footage in the woman's phone following a raid at her flat over drug allegations.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: “Do you want cocaine? “
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1600 (recalculated less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you take away the same things you did in 6th grade freshman year?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling, where no one, honor to exceptions, cares if you know or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and on the street randomly ask people if they master to determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cross and tell you they're totally in the throes.
So what the hell are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't have a need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Partly it's learning for that lot of people who need that thing is going to need.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this while standing by the machine, I was totally serious... because you just don't need to.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(In which our communist past is probably involved in our country, and against the educators and elites) However, the cost of having these machines cost us barbarians is simply high.
If journalists could count, then covid probably never reached these proportions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to quit all contact and even block it on social networks.
It has been creaky between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused to do so.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect to hate.
It was a planned attack from you! became incensed by Kadri's turnover in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gamblering and debts.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now-ex-wife did not appeal to his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly represent her brother.
Normally I don't comment on this sort of thing at all, and even in the family we never said much extra these things to each other.
I don't want to induce any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I like so much, they just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to thank my brother Qadri publicly for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we do the most needed even though, at how young an age he was.
It saddens me all the more when I have to read such false information, which is probably pretty taken out of context.
I really wish everyone knew Qadri as I, our loved ones and family stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added indefinitely.
A drunken burglar climbed down the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe for what.
His robbery quest was launched by Cao in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle in the recalculation.
After that, he could think of nothing better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene and eating a banana in the process.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The latter subsequently detained Cao Cao.
A man has confessed to drinking something alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, while drunk, he decided to plunder.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
A drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and effective bound to a pandemic emergency.
When that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law admittedly limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited but not revoked.
Over 60 per cent of voters came to the four municipalities elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišťsko region, Lusatia na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberec and in Rovna na Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councillors broke up there.
There were 99 candidates running for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Deputy President of the CSO Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, elections were more demanding on equipment as well as staffing.
In Komni na Uherskohradišťsk, Saturday's election was won by the Independent Candidates Association, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council; 18.52 percent of the electorate gave them their vote.
The former mayor of the village Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, joined the council again.
One mandate in the council was achieved by the Komňans — independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the urns.
In the village Rovná na Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, meaning four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Independent Candidates Association 1 and one from the Independent Candidates Association 2 joined the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lusatia na Mosteck were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, so has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second was the candidate Municipality for the People, who gave the vote to 43.27 percent of the electorate, so there will be three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the urns.
The election in Nová Ves in Liberec was won by independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of the electorate voted for the Independent Candidates Association and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO got 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the 2018 regular election, gained more by mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results of the election on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger deal?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing fool so you have someone to “argue” with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not arguing that Christians are degenerates, nor do anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it was replacing, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the 30 year old
tl; dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from twelve metres.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was interfered by paramedics of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
County operations centre workers took over an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews — medical and medical — immediately went to the site.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that a 27-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and hit the concrete with his head!
It caught coal in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of emergency service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further precautions under pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance vehicle transported him to further care Ostrava Traumatology Centre, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned than the coronavirus about inadequate responses from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are on the front line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended belt
MMA has had a great gala full of interesting results.
There were things going on at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peñova was able to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at light-heavyweight, performing a great stranglehold against Dustin Poirier and defending the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt with a first-round technical KO.
He also defeated his opponent by Sean O'Malley.
Surprises like no one expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle with each other as an imaginary “dwarf,” Nunes did not lose for seven years and grinded her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her way to win a lot actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, sending her to the ground.
However, Peñová did not allow herself to be forced into any further error and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack using a lever on her arm.
The second round was riveting and very thrilling for MMA fans.
Both female opponents conceived themselves with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Peñova, moreover, got Nunes to the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and knock off the effort.
Thus, the American woman prepared everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the light-heavyweight title.
At first Poirier fared better, however, the card gradually began to turn around.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his arm.
Although he did not succeed, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a number of wounds.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock off the stranglehold.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, lost after two years.
In the next bout, he scored sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right-back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
He subsequently conquered it with a series of precisely aimed blows, scoring his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most of the nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is masculine, feminine or medium.
Then there is also a fairly numerous group of nouns for which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
In inflection, they then take on dual endings and in some cases remain in a non-sloping form.
For example, the words “writhing” or “hip” are both male and female, in the former they are folded according to the pattern “machine”, in the second according to the pattern “song”.
For the next group of nouns, different forms are already in the first fall of the singular, such as: “row/row”, “khlrabi/khlrabna” or “potato/potato” (meaning foodstuff).
Both shapes are standard, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as “cucumber” in Bohemia and “curek” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian a pair of words: “trench” and “trench”, “donut” and “donut”, etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally non-inclined, but they gradually take over Czech endings.
Typical examples are the term “image”, which is both male and female, or the word “buffet”, which remained unbowed in the middle family, but in male it has endings according to the pattern “castle”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
Tensions are running rampant on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants attempting to get farther into Europe.
Thousands of people began making their way to the southern border of the Schengen zone after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians pledge support to Greece, humanitarian aid is also being forthcoming by the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we choked, describes a Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, which Australia is dealing with for the fourth straight month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the residents themselves deal with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have been doing more to forestall the drastic fallout, critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelova speaks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations always have been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written everywhere.
People find it awkward to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how horribly widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how people are often treated by their surroundings or the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgust and spat in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “much of the accusation is fictional” and that it's a “trend” you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czechia flooding houses under construction, families have no money to finish
Prices for building material have risen more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been put in an awkward situation because of this.
She does not have the resources to complete the houses under construction and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people don't have enough money to complete family homes already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage lending to them, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to unbuilt and uncollapsed houses.
Worse case scenario, houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent to do so,” says BHS economist Štěpán Kastecek.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of this has happened to us.
It's hard for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contracted, even though the material has gotten more healthy.
So we do without earnings,” said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on building a house to work out to five million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some will be waitin',” added Slivoň.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment are the most undercut.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates from construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
More favorable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit.
“Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Hamster specified.
We're doing well and we're going to do even better.
But real visions are missing, says the commentator of the CRO — Mujrozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entrance to the New Year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to the prime minister and president of ANO, President Miloš Zeman and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Senate and the House of Representatives spoke to the nation.
What fundamental did we learn?
As in, I find my diploma super right now, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's, I always work on it all year, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The stateswoman are completely at peace with us, unless a man is a total macaque and there is something left in his head, then the committee will not unnecessarily stifle him on the theory.
For example, I studied at the stateswoman for a week and when I was in the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical inference, which immediately came to my mind and I had it right.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do that semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they have caged.
To me, it's cool if at the end of the subject there is an exam that translates the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't get overwhelmed by emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as them.
Those people at the embassy might have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you might as well put up a similar statue of Putin next to the Winnie the Pooh statue.
You should still give it to put Xi Jinping on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing performers sticks under their feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
Plus they keep changing what feature is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been shitting me off lately, so I might have to cut back to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my business have success and can't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might even like it if something user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all creativity and energy from artists
Statement from Workers' Party in Donbasa
The union — yes, breaking — no, the opponents of breaking the USSR express their opinion in the slide.
Thirty years since the unlawful breaking of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Běominz forest on December 8, 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violations of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with open by the lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, they signed an agreement that “The SSR Union as a subject of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With one cut of the pen, they “abolished” a huge country with a population of nearly three hundred million.
With the breakup of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless of the loss of non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Běominh forest, destroyed what had been built for the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put the brakes on agriculture, seceded from the world's greatest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poorer of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, a series of Orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria — all the result of geopolitical surrender, surrender first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a notion in political science as a “vacuum of force.”
Everything that was betrayed and given up in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that had accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken up to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it with putting it in the fridge and making it a Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will make it cheap to 99 CZK/kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat by changing its price becomes a liability for my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 CZK/kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday about 120 CZK and left it for 3 days in your fridge?
I will answer myself - I do nothing.
This crap about the fact that when something is cheap it must be guaranteed bad, spoiled or poor quality is horribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies gave out some pamphlet, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it out...
Well, the pamphlet was full of sanity and conservative views of the workings of the world, but nowhere about god, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some such agitka.
After reading it, I found who was publishing it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good stuff, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pig.
Pity the paper, because of this the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love him without realizing how much in the p*deli the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk out.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
After that, she began physically blocking the door.
It was a cool relationship for about a year but then another half year went by and started to get her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship with I told her from I was breaking up and luring her but we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch some amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurers are frantically shattering here by buying a cloud of tests and hounding for positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees in the random number generator falling five days of house arrest.
In the west, they stopped with the crenchery, acknowledging that there was no value in tackling a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new and he has to cut some more and drive his ego by making up a faggot.
I see the good old scumbag is coming back to us again.
After several years of downplaying and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelance again.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at the matriculated school), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly flipped into “you don't need to be interested, especially get people”.
I was sincerely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to frighten and talk a person.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to find a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earners, or then one felt like a peddling pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, a person learned not to jump on every spit right away and scrutinise the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
People are successful in this business and even people benefit, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or “fat” account.
In the corporate where I do, I haven't experienced much of that sort of thing.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management, and they don't put our noses in anything.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form of what it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what is not) - it is more of a self-assessment than that someone would rate you by some numbers, and stuff like that.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments what are more “corporate”.
Sometimes one feels like we are such a skoro-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't annoy us much as long as the results are.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days British police have been searching fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December Jakub Kulhánek, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradištsko had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of the deaths is under investigation.
We will not be disclosing more information about the case with respect to the family.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on her way home from work; she was still supposed to collect money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, London police began a search for her, Interpol ranked her among the missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already detained one man in this connection several days ago.
What role he should have played in the case and what he suspects it of, but did not disclose.

The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more severe epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President Czech Statistical Office.
The last voting precinct was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hrs.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Elections Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous contagious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without major snags.
Coping with how idiotic a large portion of the population on all its strata is positioning themselves to this, I have a problem with that up to now.
On vaccination (tomorrow!) I'm looking forward to the most because he makes me finally less dependent on other people not being shits.
He would be deprived of the post of president and the eligibility to retake it.
But the chances of this happening are very small, as others here mention.
Moreover, I'm not sure if the miscarding of a file could even be considered high treason.
High treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threaten the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: There is a growing number of people under 35 who are sexless all year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious-based people, the DailyMail website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who disown sex lives rose from eight to 21 per cent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 years old who reported that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age reporting that they have not had sex for the previous year has grown rapidly,” said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people, in 2021 only 5% of them reported having been without sex for the past year.
For single people it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the decline of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinion about premarital sex divides, with about 30% of it for the wrong thing, while approx. 70% think it's okay.
“It is true that among single individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting that trend,” Stone speaks of those thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious establishment.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to nearly 60 per cent.
Among the “less believers,” the trend has picked up from 10 per cent to 20 per cent,” Stone claimed.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and most importantly social drinking of alcohol during pandemic times.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less likely for people out of work or lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly behind lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandating of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force some of the population into behaviors that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's a rather tough question that I'm personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't tell them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80 year old person who didn't actually know much, well we didn't explain it to him, overheard some misinformation, and as a result get inoculated didn't give and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination who rants something about bullying and a totalitarian state here alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly imported that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter sign on fighting drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators can not do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend, or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have a story, but it's not about a little boy.
One time in high school, a teacher led us across town to a boatyard so we could ride boats down the river.
On the way there, we walked down one quite wide street and who we do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but she and a friend were talking.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
“They asked me if I said I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul,” she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed all the way through to the boathouse.
We're terribly spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew into Warsaw, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint news conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it jointly clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by disturbing Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, is convenient to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandy Group,” France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured, according to DPA, that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of runners.
Drunk Polish nuncane smacks accident, tried to conceal it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police officers told her that she could lose her driver's license for not giving precedence in driving and driving from the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle asking her for help.
The police officers then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and, after discovering she had over two promilles in her blood, promptly removed her driver's license.
At the same time, they notified her that she would be confessing from her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have been seen in American stories about dog sweethearts.
But they forgot about the essential thing: the regularities of film craft.
After the cheesy film F. Brabek Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, the next film Here We Watch Over is now in store for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-writer and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovich Jr., is a loosely follow-up to his previous film Here I Watch Me from 2012.
A talking dachshund, Hugo, and some well-known characters around him, return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is moribent, so they begin to invite the dog, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the narrative procedures already in the previous dog picture, but there were at least entertained children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is in the desire for a child to obscure delusions, and if the right “constellation” comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined — on the hood of the car or church tower (obviously during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), despite years of training, retired Colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, Whereupon the family is taken from the hospital so that the miraculous process of healing by the dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal darlings.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is astonished at what content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from staff, a doggie competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving at the show looking for “drugs” and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal — and which baked of course, the family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits ondled and made up with cigars at the family table, clamoring for her father's whiskey and slackers as a cured vegetarian, there is no laughing.
The creator will explain to the viewer that “it sometimes happens after a coma”.
Shaymovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to construct load-bearing situations, a flair for character characters and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are unsettled, the cut clueless and the overall impression uptight.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they do not have much to play.
The film's only feature remains poetic footage of the Šumava nature of cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog buzz, let alone the more folksy profanities that the characters indulge.
The argument is not even the years-old membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club — as in the case of Mrs Producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from exactly nerds like you.
There's a difference between bidding and forcing, here's to see how you understand the turd, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that kind of guy all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in it the case of the earnings brigade.
The Middle East has been troubled by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have noted it at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports just six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time here.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced by Nazareth resident Wasím Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the three most recent rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water landholders warned of drought long ago.
“It is to be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may wane here,” Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, projected in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Worse off are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
Tanker cars are on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Indeed, water pipes and private wells are drying up.
“This year my orders have soared by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years,” Imad Suleiman, a tanker car driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have erupted in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military crackdown on Iran
Israel's defense minister said negotiations in Vienna had yielded “no progress” and that he had briefed Washington on preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Secretary Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who is staying in the US, has been trying to persuade the Americans to escalate their pressure on Iran, but has also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had yielded “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are messing with them.”
About 3 years ago, this happened to me, too.
I pranked the lady a little and grilled while talking to see what she actually wanted me to do.
Eventually, I discovered that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I took the miss for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a punt, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, plenty of snow and nice weather awaited them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have started operations due to this.
The slope has not been deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts either.
While lifters are not complaining about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rentals are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to the cross-country ski trails and the slopes at the weekend.
Skiers liked the weather, which today offered sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Ještěd Jakub, the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanush.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna in Šumpersk were opened.
Weekend attendance was very respectable, with an estimated 400 people arriving both Saturday and today.
Conditions are surety.
Today the sunshine was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can sell a ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after having had a COVID-19 disease.
With exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn skicentre told ČTK.
“We only recorded incident units,” he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic are reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Interest in renting skis thankfully is.
It's not like the past years, but there are still quite a lot of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from Opava shop Skiopava.
A bigger onslaught is expected during the ski course period.
The executive director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear David Šinták feels that due to covid there is no interest in lending ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already almost borrowed.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
People, according to him, became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a great demand is noted by the rental company in the Novako premises on the Divine Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must already order them in advance.
“We are starting to rent cross-country skiing this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the premises.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must be able to experience a quality life here like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or doctor specialist.
Abroad are going smart and skilable people who have no assets here.
The owner of a business abroad really doesn't just leave.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people don't see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they just won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one fine day Orban won, reigned for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a couple of tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections at all.
If you live bad, then some traditional V4K freak can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, remain his backers and people whose possessions can't be shoved onto the plane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
In doing so, the actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a genuine injury, or is it about making out for the sake of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen following her way home.
“Petra's disappearance is not at all unlike her behavior, and we are starting to have a lot of concern for her,” Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, served as a “nurses assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We have immense concern for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the medical facilities group said in a Twitter post.
“We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help find her to contact police,” the communication continued.
The public is also calling for cooperation by Harriet Harman MP, who raised the Srncova case at a press conference on Saturday.
'She's been missing for days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death, 'said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman in her hand distributed by the London Police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and working here for our health service,” she stated Harman.
Police have previously detained one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of being.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine this way either.
These are not “huge amounts” but ca 8 percent of the Russian military.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted at the top.
I don't know what he made out of that Russia wanted the war.
War is one hell of an expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons to the situation in 38 are off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that to the First Punic War and the “annexation” of Sicily:D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it wasn't going to honor the Minsk agreements, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the “concentration” at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly touching suburban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, became defunct.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, speeders from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradské Město station.
In suburban train services, S7 trains run through Prague Central Station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 speedtrain from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop in the recently opened station Praha-Zahradní Město.
PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will run as far as Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladoboleslavsko region will be incorporated, including overlaps to Liberec and Hradec Královéhrad regions.
At the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones introduced, and traffic will be modified on 12 functioning.
A new bus line 405 will run from Zličín in Prague, which will run all the way to Žatka.
A new direct connection Praha — Kralovice u Rakovník was also established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
They will be strengthened during the morning rush hour and on the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when express line number 404 will be newly exited.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 goes via Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, is canceled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are canceled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines Praha — Beroun, Praha — Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymbursk region have been changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region are modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classically 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next door to Billy or a short distance away to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy a maximum of pizza bun and yogurt and apple for snack.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you advise me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, that's the way it is unfortunately
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily need to see.
Only the tip of the sapling can hide under the snow.
If it destructs, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not arguing that's the only reason they forbid us to go off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about the relationship with Nedved: This is not what I was looking forward to
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond lives nothing more than the revelation of the relationship of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been dragging it together since the summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she kept love from them for a long half year.
“I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who missed that Dara caught a bear, I mean sorry, Nedved,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is into the most successful Czech footballer in love with her head.
He said he packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If those who don't care at all and pops it on them even from canned food, or us whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are quite a good fit for each other, or insist that everyone really knows your list in detail former partners and were familiar with enlisting your mistakes and mistakes.
I mean, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was riding for preparations for her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has worked there for a long time as vice-president of Juventus football club.
With the truth out, they went only now because they were waiting for Nedjad's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us, thank you.
Even we are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and as he does with me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, she closed Rolins.
Hi, others commenting have probably said all the essentials already, just confirming that the dorms are super to start, my classmates mostly got to know each other during the first semester or two and they made friends and then found sublease together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise themselves very long ahead of time, so you probably won't find much right now, but looking at the offer certainly doesn't hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), some parts of Židenice are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is nice, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where you are going exactly).
I have never wanted rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack any information:)
That, to me, is an example of completely “normal” reasoning, though.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite fine that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own or let them go by state and pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will throw in a full state contribution a few crowns and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when written by a person who, two days before, had made such comments about a petitional action for boycotting a totalitarian state:
So a vote against whether someone gets an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
I would have consulted directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away from the eye or write something in the way xxx *** or... (by convention) and to note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd deal with it probably somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and trying student, you could look into some character databases and look up the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits with what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't that, by any chance, more like the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than Odrynian?
PSS: someone already cracked this place for you.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the “theme” of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The notion that they would approve of something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for this anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus, with that English, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year and totally cool.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
Only someone who hasn't set foot in his life can say that's ghetto.
Yeah, probably most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good downtown accessibility, I'd feel free to go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Daddy and mistress Gelemova like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovacek did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Daddy wreath, and Lucie certainly has some, said Blesku the saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
She visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently reunited with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemová: BACK TOGETHER!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemová: BACK TOGETHER!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy Dada and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone who I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Luďk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he was making that clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have both troops and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, explain that to me then?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and they can't afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava is going to the head of previous governments, not the army, they have been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change farm subsidies, the landscape is not meant to be just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought period in years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreases in mountainous and submontane areas, the smaller amount of rainfall is recorded even in places where there has been no emergency of moisture.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe.
The impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, I can barely keep myself in ice skates, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey, and that tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is a whole lot.
And whether you are a hockey team “copper Russia” or “llama china” so losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is matched.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators prying out, what the referees don't notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and “Italian actors” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, and that the Czech Republic lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be classic “vthey lost” vs “WE won”.
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100 000 in the Czech Republic 1967, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an 'inevitable' major wave of contagion, caused by Omikron, said on television on Sunday Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviserwoman for the British Health Security Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Those infected with omicron are already hospitalised in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
No one has died of omikron yet, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer found on Sunday that Boris Johnson appears to have broken the law by staging a lockdown last December, when lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned, in Downing Street Christmas quiz.
One minister in the Johnson government defended that the quiz took place “virtually,” via a computer.
However, it was attended in Downing Street by groups of staff, gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the prime ministerial post.
During last December, when strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
Both the British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election overwhelmingly.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much is there to expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán weren't like that either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of voting precincts to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
That will allow Fidesz to bind voters from decided precincts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that fair they won't be at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be a matter of not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority as well.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
This is a big non-fuss for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in trying to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of parliament speaker and one of the leaders of Fidesz, Lászlóa Kövér, leaked to independent media outlets telling secret service chiefs that the opposition was a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my daddy has her long, but then she slams extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I fretted like a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and was all blue, they took it under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me an educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, as a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I can at least punch into something, and as a younger one, for example, I slapped my parents on the hand (to she didn't get much through the holdout), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share of it, too.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it wasn't “nurturing” anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just did something Fucks up, I guess it's not possible to get your kids at least a little prick, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws are to be clear and unambiguous
So I would call Kundami those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of an income outage?
Can it really be counted on that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage out of?
Kochner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the main story begins in the trial of four defendants of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kushnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kčner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a turning point will the process mark for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely responsible for this.
How is it that this petition had orders of magnitude more media attention than a counter petition by the deans of all medical schools that came out a day, two later?
No, they got screwed up and the company bounced it off.
Czech television was dying with covid until half a year ago.
Another government ends and a law involving municipalities in choosing a repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law, which was intended to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in selecting and allowing deep water storage of high radioactive wastes, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government discontinued consideration of a proposal submitted to the Government after years of protractions by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect from the law to strengthen their options more significantly when deciding on the repository that has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which the Czech atomic law and the European directive calls for.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition treaty.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which has the Platform available, concerns municipalities in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of the site for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Management to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed substantive intention proposal almost completely neglects public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statists in permitting procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of locating and selecting a site for the repository, its permitting and operation.
Really according to today's legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit comments or appeal, but the office or minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation shall decide.
Any action shall not have a deferential effect on the implementation of exploration or construction work.
Codecision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced the authorization of storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and a follow-up to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-Mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesperson of Platform Against Deep Storage said: After the Ministers of Industry who straighten the position of self-governments to the state authorities in search of a deep-sea repository of highly radioactive wastes only condemned on their successors, we are waiting for a more significant reversal from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand to this.
For our support, we also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a major construction similarly as directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The Anti-Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 societies) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-water storage.
Furthermore, the platform advocates that the decision to select the site for possible storage is subject to prior approval of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced into a slimming scare: He shed 90kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually shed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180kg, The Sun newspaper reports.
He flaunted his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
“I was poking everything in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can no longer afford to sit still, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends what boss and what you want to use the word “boss” in.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so the “boss” is something like the master/ruler of the given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are bosses hidden (super boss, hidden boss) who are not needed to beat at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games, where bosses are, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
Well, then there are mini bosses.
Ono lump in one word somehow translate boss just probably not even possible, Czech and other languages does not solve it somehow (interesting is only Catalan, which bosse translates as final adversary).
It is in short for a story or game in general significant, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7.
Throughout Interpol at the same time, he helps British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is on the search for Petra.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
“We share information with each other about the case,” she added.
The search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, is skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She became involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
“We have huge concerns about her,” she said at a Saturday news conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police officers have already detained one suspect.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czechia terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October pointed to a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are purposefully aimed at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is intended to arouse attention in the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous appendix had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11, 2021... exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, for example, email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored logins, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, Formbook spyware remained active as well.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November picked up rather campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still stands for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks ran continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook included most often an attachment with the extension .exe, which carried the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at Fareit, which was behind 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
That demos of smarts today who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to footage of the parade down the embankment and in my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of an estimate of around 10 thousand people.
People in the parade filled both the waterfront and the bridge and the opposing riverfront road.
That means people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the parade of about four thousand protesters.
I argue that something new is born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, anti-gappers and Co. couldn't fill or pay for this big parade.
The actions of the Chcípled Dog Association have an upward popularity, reminds me of A Million Misters for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get this impression that they rent the same podium and technique as well.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be made of this discontent depends not only on the supply of money, but also whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine doesn't become four and more dosed.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or center movement, bet that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost definitely become multi-dose, since it is obvious that we will have to get re-vaccinated every half a year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
End Stalemate, Bulgaria Has New Prime Minister Reaching Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked with assembling a new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections.
That has already managed to put together a government of broad coalition that is expected to take office within days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the past government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost elections.
However, the victorious parties preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not be agreed, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
Of the “secretly” footage taken, it is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been searching for days by London police.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home to the south of the British metropolis from work.
For information about a children's hospital worker, besides the police, calls from her existing employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
“Petra's disappearance is not at all unlike her behavior, and we are starting to have a lot of concern for her,” Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, served as a “nurses assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We have immense concern for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the medical facilities group said in a Twitter post.
“We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help find her to contact police,” the communication continued.
Šumperska amateur children's room painter Zdeněka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councilor) said that she violates copyright by her paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of the Mole in the Šumperské humperské rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch has appeared for a month.
It was about life.
The Magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs to, and because it said it was unresponsive, the hole went on.
Eventually the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to “intensively deal with the situation”.
