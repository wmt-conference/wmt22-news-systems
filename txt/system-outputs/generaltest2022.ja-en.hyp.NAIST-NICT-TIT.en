When I tried to purchase the entry package, a blue and orange package came out.
The price is more than double the orange one.
What is the difference?
Please let me know because I did not understand even if I looked it up.
Right now, there should be only blue.
If there is, it may just be that the old product remains.
It’s just a different look, both are the same.

Was the Destiny Plan of "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" a bonanza where Durandal was dumped by Talia?

Since I arrived in the U.S., I called again and again to make an appointment for an interview, and then I called again and again a month later without a word, and I finally got it after almost a month, saying that I could make an appointment and it would arrive within two weeks.
Well I guess it was a practice of phone calls in English... but it is too difficult to hear English on the phone

Because of that, I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Is it that comedians have become impossible? TV is only comedians.
I saw Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there are quite a lot of scenes where the staff giggles in the back even when they say something that is not particularly interesting.
It's obviously not an interesting place, but it's creepy to gloat that "I have to laugh at everything I say because I'm a popular entertainer".
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainer will be in a bad mood, and it will be in bad taste in terms of work relationships.
Like the black companies of the past, that industry is like a sports day, and it seems that some entertainers' egos are too big and they usually have a bad attitude, and if they don't do that, they won't be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say "Don't lick entertainers" every time the entertainer himself feels the difficulty of his work.
I know that my income is quite low until I can sell it, but even if I'm told that entertainers are at the top of underperforming occupations.
The beautification of one's own career and the justification for comedians being too high in the media and society sounds like nothing more than a justification.
To be honest, the industry I work in is quite tough, but I feel that it is becoming more and more impossible to touch the entertainer world.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt it was not good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart ...

Ikemoto Printing Co., Ltd. mail order
A selection of hairbrushes!
A sample will be given to the purchaser
I replaced the item I ordered at the Tsukumo net shop without permission.
Summary: When I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, I received a wired version of that mouse and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
It is a mail order trouble rather than a topic of self-made PC, but I am not convinced no matter how I think about it and it is a famous place, so I will write it here.
It started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen (linked gyotaku) at the Tsukumo Day sale at Tsukumo Net Shop, which started the previous Friday.
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so considering the possibility of price mistakes, I checked the wired version page and found that it was 5,071 yen (linked gyotaku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order email arrived successfully, and the shipping email arrived the next day.
The name of "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history on My Page.
At this point, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive because there was no communication of mistake or cancellation notice from order to shipment.
There was a problem from here, and a few hours after shipping I got an email saying that there was a mistake in the registration of the product.
According to that email
The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually a wired version.
I've already shipped a wired mouse
Refuse to receive it and cancel it completely
Return the mouse only and refund
Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose a response.
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version are divided, and the purchase history, e-mail, and delivery note say that it is a wireless version, but it seems to have replaced it with the wired version without permission and sent it.
Wouldn’t it be terrible if I was sent something different from the product I bought without permission, and if I wanted a refund, I would return it from here?
Even if you accept a refund in the end, I want to fight back one shot, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you are job hunting or looking for a partner, do you not want to go out with someone who is not on good terms with your parents’ house?

I don't mind.
The reason why we don't get along well is because there are various personalities and unreasonable people, whether parents or siblings.

The only bridge leading to the district was washed away by a typhoon and heavy rain. Residents triple their food reserves in Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima Television) - Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto of the Kochihara district of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The East Japan Typhoon of 2019 had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: “At first, it was like, ‘Really?’
The only road leading to the Kochihara district, the Kochihara Bridge, was washed away by a typhoon in eastern Japan, leaving 11 households and 30 residents in the district isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry necessary supplies using the railway bridge of JR, which is not normally allowed to pass through.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: “Usually, you can drive to the garden, but when you get out of the car over there, you can hold it in your hand or carry it on your back and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt grateful for the mode of transportation and the car.”
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of lessons learned.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: “I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to secure enough food for two to three days somehow.”
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, I don't know when a disaster will befall me, so I felt once again that it would be better for everyone to stockpile a little."
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Director of the Yamatsuri Town Education Division: "We have announced that this will be designated as Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day, and that October 12 will be a day to think about disaster prevention preparations next year and beyond.
I think I've become more aware of the fact that unexpected things can happen."

The Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
invigorating the used housing market New “Building Condition Survey” system Used housing transactions are doing well.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the remodeling market is on an expanding trend.
While the desire to own a home has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, the popularity of properties represented by soaring words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station", "large-scale", and "tower" has been concentrated, and the number of relatively cheap new properties has decreased sharply.
However, compared to other countries, the market share of existing (used) houses in Japan remains low.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, so-called inspection, aimed at trading safe and secure used houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which architects who are familiar with housing check the current situation, including deterioration of the property, and the condition of the building, summarize it in a report, and present it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explained that the introduction of inspections would benefit both buyers and sellers.
Sellers can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property survey prior to the sale and purchase transaction, giving buyers a sense of security.
This will in turn lead to differentiation of competing properties, he said.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to understand the condition of the used house they intend to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and at first glance it is a system with great benefits, he explains.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the right to lead the building condition survey.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the system of inspection has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain, “When brokering a property, we can refer you to an architect who conducts a building condition survey” or “I can’t,” but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries where the secondhand market is booming, similar systems have already been put in place.
It is a system in which buyers ask experts called “inspectors” or “building surveyors” to conduct building surveys in the pre-sale stage of housing.
In the United States, for example, inspections are carried out in 70-90% of used home transactions, depending on the state.
In that the “buyer” leads the inspection, it is very different from the Japanese-style inspection where the “seller” is the main.
The seller tries to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, buyers want to live with peace of mind by scrutinizing the contents of the survey and making appropriate repairs.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a gap in the objectives and thoughts of both sides.
For this reason, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection set by the government is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an "absolute" inspection will be conducted, such as not reporting the results of the investigation unfavorable to the seller.

It was pretty tough.
However, I was mentally healed (?), so I was full of motivation.
I could not keep up with my body and I was a researcher, so I fell asleep during work.
It was the second time in a year, so I thought I would take a month off and say goodbye to the crappy garbage company, but it was more serious than I thought and I wanted to see the medicine did not fit, so it dragged on.
Anyway, it's important to see a psychiatrist to deal with it correctly and to leave a history of hospital visits (super important).
As long as you have a history of hospital visits, even if you leave the company at your own convenience, you can change it to retirement at the discretion of the doctor at Harois, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance and so on will be greatly lowered

Was Ginza an island?
Five Trivias You Can Talk About While Strolling (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
“This place used to be a peninsula.
It is unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia such as ... "
Here are some tips on Ginza that are interesting to know and will make you want to tell someone.
Going above Ginza! ?
First time infiltrating Kinza
When you walk around Ginza, you will see quirky place names, enigmatic stone monuments, numerous shrines, and other vestiges of the history of the area.
When I was walking in Ginza with her, I suddenly came to silence and said, "This used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo is synonymous with the downtown area that created "XX Ginza" all over Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to the mint of silver coins, and in 1612, the Ginza office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shinryogae-cho", but when it moved to Kakigara-cho, it became known by the common name of "Ginza".
By the way, in the past, the area around Ginza was a "peninsula" sticking out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, there was an inlet from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and proceeded with the improvement of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city block and set up a moat to develop boat transportation.
He cut down the moated soil and Mt. Kanda to fill in the cove.
There is a stone monument in front of Tiffany's Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), indicating the site of the Ginza government office, so why not look for it if you are interested.
"Pilgrimage to the Holy Land" in Ginza known to those in the know
In Ginza, there is an annual pilgrimage to holy places known only to those in the know called the "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour".
Of the ten or more sacred sites, the most visible is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theatre.
Many people visit the shrine on the far right of the Kabuki-za Theatre before and after watching the play.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizoson" is on the Ginza Terrace on the ninth floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
Hodo Inari Shrine, Azuma Inari Shrine, and Toyoiwa Inari Shrine are located at the back of the alley, making them less conspicuous, but Toyoiwa Inari Shrine is known for being revered by Kabuki actor Uzaemon Ichimura, and Success Inari Shrine at the entrance on the first floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrines.
This tour of shrines includes places that enshrine Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most shrines enshrine Inari.
Inari Shrine, where foxes welcome you in front of the main shrine building, was built in large numbers in areas where there are many farmers because of the benefits of a good harvest of rice.
Later, in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, it was said to bring prosperity to business, and the faith spread even in Ginza, the busiest downtown area in Japan.

A man was found lying face down and dying in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya City just before noon on the 12th.
Police are investigating the man’s identity, cause of death, etc.
According to the police, at 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down on the Shonai River in Nakashidanmi, Moriyama Ward and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but he was confirmed dead on the spot.
Police are rushing to confirm the identity and investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Sunagawa, Fukuoka Town, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disturbance in the man's clothes, but it means that a bicycle was down nearby.

Posco International acquires Senex Energy of Australia to expand gas field business overseas (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on June 12 that it has signed an agreement to acquire a stake in Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in March next year, with the approval of the Senex Energy shareholders’ meeting and approval of the local subsidiary remaining.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The purchase price was KRW 770.9 billion, of which POSCO International and Hankook Energy decided to invest 50.1% and 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International explained that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will bisect the market along with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market as well.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will have 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, or 44 percent of South Korea’s natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local onshore gas field operators in Australia.

That knee pain, maybe “osteoarthritis of the knee joint”! ?
Medical DOC: Different Treatments by Cause - Yahoo! News
Editorial Team: Recently, I have been having knee pain.
What kind of disease is possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, “osteoarthritis” is common in Japanese people.
Editor: Do you mean that the joints will deform?
Dr. Maruyama: That’s right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, and it is responsible for relieving shocks and smoothing joint movements.
However, due to aging, obesity, intense sports, etc., cartilage may wear out or distort.
As a result, it leads to joint deformation and inflammation.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis develop outside of the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and base of the fingers of the hand, neck, hips, big toes, hip joints, etc.
However, the most common cases occur in the knee and are called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial Department: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: The joints are made up of two bones that are combined in an uneven pattern.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped with "articular hull".
Editor: So it’s a complex structure.
Dr. Maruyama: That’s right.
In the inner layer of the articular capsule, there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid plays the role of a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That’s why people say that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee movement.
Editorial Department: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic, and it plays a role in preventing bones from hitting each other directly.
So to speak, it is like a cushion.
However, if this wears out or distorts, it deforms or inflames the joints, causing pain.
Is it pajamas when you sleep?
Basically, I wear pajamas, but when my pyjamas are washing, I wear jerseys and sleep!
Are there some heavy smokers who can quit smoking and others who can't?
That's right, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy, but I quit completely.
Somehow I thought I would stop, so I quit as it was.

Three gambling and games in the Kaiji series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo!
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the best parts of this work is the extreme game that puts your life on the line.
[Picture] Just looking at it makes my legs shudder ... ... trying to cross the steel frame!
Therefore, this time, I would like to verify the Kaiji game that can actually be played or is practiced in the planning video.
The swamp The swamp is a pachinko parlor full of traps that appeared in Gambling Hakairoku Kaiji .
In the original, it surprised Kaiji with a high rate of 4,000 yen per ball.
Large traps were set up in the swamp, including a nail forest, movable objects, and a three-tier croon, making it almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used every means at his disposal, and in the end, he went on a rampage of sinking and tilting the ground by placing a vinyl water tank in the building, and captured it brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as pachinko, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen a piece", and the difficulty level has been reduced, but you can taste the mood of Kaiji.
Steel frame crossing At the "Star Side Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, debtors including Kaiji were made to carry out the steel frame crossing of "human horse racing".
The debtor competes for speed by moving forward while devising ways to prevent it from falling over a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve contestants will compete and the top two will walk away with a cash prize, but only four steel frames, insufficient safety measures, and a very high chance of dying.
This steel-frame crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience it very close at Eagle Bridge installed at Rakuten Life Park Miyagi, the home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.
The Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high (equivalent to the seventh floor of a building) with a single steel bridge, and beyond that, there is a "Sky Blanco" and a "Victory Bridge," and you walk to it.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Koala Koarashi released a video of her walking on Eagle Bridge on YouTube, saying, "You can experience steel-frame walking in Japan," and it became a hot topic.
E-card The E-card is a two-player card game.
There are 10 cards in total: one emperor's card, eight citizens' cards, and one slave's card.
The game is very well done and has the property that the emperor is strong against citizens, citizens are strong against slaves, and slaves are strong against emperors.
Kaiji plays against Tonegawa in the play under the strict rule that "If you lose, you will cut your ears".
Kaiji realizes that a device that destroys the ears, such as earbuds attached to the ears, senses and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, and reads the psychology. He confuses the Tone River by cutting his ears to the limit and making his body abnormal, and wins.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, posted a video in which he competed with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, with E-cards, which attracted a lot of attention.
Would you like to taste the Kaiji mood?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it is also true that when you read the manga, you will taste only the mood.
Why don't you feel that world view through the game?
A step towards the New Year, a gentle boost: A large votive tablet of a tiger at Gokoku Shrine|Yamagata Shimbun
Okinawa Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), which is preparing for the new year, has a large ema (votive tablet) of next year's zodiac sign "Tora."
Students from Tohoku University of Art and Technology, who designed it, visited the shrine on the 11th and held a dedication ceremony in front of the gods.
Since the year before last, the shrine has asked art students to draw the original ema.
This time, a work by Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was selected from among the nine students in the Japanese painting course of the Department of Fine Arts under the supervision of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high in the center.
Tsuchiya said that he drew it with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he embarks on a new year.
The image of a tiger stopping and looking at the cherry blossoms expresses the hope that “we can afford to celebrate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world.”
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on ema (votive tablets) distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, “I think it will help all people overcome difficulties.”

Let's think about "Tamano who wants to continue to live" To the proposal 4 high school students workshop in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital|San Desi
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano who wants to continue to live".
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the Tamano SDGs Future Development Center, an intermediate support organization, the Ministry will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
"When is it fun?"
When asked by the facilitator, the students say things like, “When you get excited with many people” and “When you play drums.”
The first meeting was held at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13.
Eighteen high school students and members of the local community thought about "interesting towns", "comfortable towns to live in" and "towns where people feel a sense of purpose in life" using the method of "World Cafe" where they discussed while moving around the "islands" with their own themes set.
Each idea is written down on sticky notes and pasted on imitation paper to organize it.
“A town with a lot of young people looks interesting,”“Trains and buses are indispensable for livability.”
We will discuss further whether there is anything in common.
“I thought Tamano was boring, but it’s fascinating to be able to cycle along the seaside,” said a third-year student at Tamano Shoko High School (18).
A third-year student (18) of Binan High School said, “There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but the place rich in nature is good,” and by talking with adults, he seemed to notice not only the challenges of the region but also the appeal.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to sort out the contents of the recommendations.
We plan to invite the mayor and superintendent of education to make an announcement as soon as next February.
Rie Azuma, president of the center, said, "We hope that this will be an opportunity for high school students to develop a love of their hometown and for young people to be actively involved in town planning."
Seismic intensity of 4 on the Richter scale, M5.0 on the Richter scale in the Kanto region.
At around 0:31 p.m. on the 12th, there was an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 4 in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma and Saitama prefectures.
According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, at a depth of about 50 kilometers.
The earthquake is estimated to have a magnitude of 5.0.
There is no worry about tsunami.
Seismic intensity in various places is as follows.
Seismic intensity 4 = Yuki, Kasama Ishii (Ibaraki), Ashikaga Taisho, Kiryu Motojuku in western Tochigi (Tochigi), Ota West Honmachi (Gunma), Saitama Iwatsuki Ward, Kazo (Saitama), etc. ▽ Seismic intensity 3 = Mito (Ibaraki), Utsunomiya (Tochigi), Maebashi Horikoshi (Gunma), Kawagoe Shinjuku (Saitama), Chiba Hanami River (Chiba), Otemachi (Tokyo), Tsurumi Suehiro (Kanagawa), etc. ▽ Seismic intensity 2 = Koriyama Konan (Fukushima), Hitachi (Ibaraki), Kanuma (Tochigi), Takasaki (Gunma), etc.

How to find a new way of winding a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
Stalls are indispensable in winter, but are there times when the cloth wobbles under your neck?
It is a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding it, but I sometimes hear that I do not know the trick.
I thought that it would be nice if there was a stole that could be rolled up quickly without the cloth sticking, but I found a novel one.
The stole of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is a more compact size than the general one.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Is it so short that I can wind it?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is knitted into a single piece of slender, cut cloth, and the whole is mesh-like.
The end of the stole can be passed through the mesh.
So, it can be wound and fastened without tying the ends together.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular as outerwear, but many people will wear them in combination with stoles so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I’m sure it’s convenient to have such a stole.

The Beatles documentary that comes to Disney Plus is super interesting
It was directed by Peter Jackson called Get Buck
It's raw, or rather, a life-sized Beatles, and it's fresh in many ways...
It's just before the breakup, so I'm doing Gisgis, but it's not the dramatic Gisgis I imagined.
It's like a troublesome pole like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" while doing my best to divide, George who seems to be languishing "But yeah", John who is late and unmotivated while calmly saying opinions and jokes ... Honestly, Ringo, who plays the role of comfort, does not actively interject, and sits in the back with a face of "troubled".
We don't hate each other so much that we fight, but there is a feeling that there is a very strong atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and it's interesting that the Beatles was like that It's like dismantling the legend, or rather
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance started, everyone was really talented
The process of turning a little phrase into "that masterpiece" while each other is doing "how about this?" is dangerous.
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing.
It's amazing that the scene where a casual humming like Hun Hun Hun gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics enter is recorded firmly.
It's amazing to see the songwriting process like this.
It is natural, but everyone is greasy, so you can be happy just by watching the performance scene
It seems that it is still one of the three episodes, but so far the biggest cause of dissolution was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles itselfI had the impression that it was.
It would be fun if the four of them started writing songs while complaining about something, but when we talked about what to do with the venue of the live performance, the producers and touts were like, "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!"
Well, the director's interpretation is included in the documentary, so Peter Jackson may have felt that way...
Also, Paul seems to be supervising, so I thought that maybe that's why Paul has a lot of villainous scenes.

You said that you could not do it, but if you can find what you are good at and what you can do in yourself, I think that your way of life will be somewhat easier in the future.
– Of course, I think it’s okay to think about this after you’ve rested slowly and relaxed your mind.
However, I think that there is also a daily life, so if there is a union of the company, an industrial doctor, or a window where you can consult, there may be some system if you consult there, so I think that it is a good idea to consult once.
I hope that I will be able to live with a little easier feeling in the future.

Tornadoes frequently occur in the United States, causing major damage Unseasonable warmth and strong cold weather (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
Tornadoes occurred frequently, mainly in the southern United States, from the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time.
It is thought that cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly because the atmospheric conditions became very unstable due to the strong cold air moving southward where it was a record warmth for this time.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday, September 9 and Friday, September 10 local time has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
A strong cold air of -30°C or less moved southward at an altitude of 5,500 m, and an active front was formed by a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly along the front.
Tornadoes are believed to have occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage at this time of year.
A record number of tornado warnings were issued in one day during the winter months, reaching nearly 150.
More than 400 tornadoes and gusts were reported to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on Friday, the 10th local time alone.
According to this, there are roughly two concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of the tornado, reached EF3, the third strongest of the six stages, and it is believed that a gust of wind of around 70 m/s occurred instantaneously.
Depending on the future survey, it may be judged to be EF4 to 5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the improved Fujita scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale to match the conditions of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, is quite likely to occur in Japan, and it is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

U.S. Tornado "Largest in History" Calls for Help Live from Under the Rubble (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News
“It’s one of the biggest tornadoes in U.S. history,” Biden said in a statement on Tuesday.
CNN Television and others reported.
“We will do everything in our power as the federal government,” Biden said.
“We still don’t know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost,” he explained.
More than 100 people were feared dead.
More than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, from the night of Dec. 10 to the early hours of Dec. 11.
The tornado caused 219 miles (350 kilometers) of damage in Missouri and other states in 1925, but CNN weather experts estimated that it was the largest tornado to hit the state this time, at about 250 miles.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was heavily damaged, the candle factory, which was operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season, was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and no trace was left.
In the darkness, a woman stuck under the rubble, about 1.5 meters thick, felt the weight of rescuers searching on the rubble and asked for help via Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also included screams and the song "Happy Birthday to You", which was supposedly sung by another woman crying to distract her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son after a tornado warning came out.
“There are many people who liken it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrifying sound like the sound of the earth gushing out something more,” he recalled.
A police officer from the Mayfield Police Department said: "We will continue the search operation until it is no longer necessary.
I don’t know how many weeks, months, or years it will be,” he said, continuing his hard work.
In Illinois, at least six people have been confirmed dead after a warehouse at e-commerce giant Amazon collapsed.
Trains have been derailed due to the impact of being cut off, and highways have been blocked one after another due to the impact of falling vehicles.
A total of about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power, according to US web media.

There is an old saying that the way of thinking about the evaluation system of the star system is different.
In contrast to other countries where points are deducted from five stars as a standard, Japan insists on adding or subtracting points with three stars as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and the four stars have completely different meanings in "there is a point deduction element" and "not a masterpiece but an honorable mention".
If it is based on five stars, “works that have no drawbacks” and “works of the highest standard in everything” will be on the same footing, so if there is such a tendency, I think that it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but in fact, such a system is operated in such a way, so I would like you not to give it three stars (notoriety).

Bento: Fried seasonal fish and shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce
"hakobune" is a take-out specialty store for colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) using plenty of vegetables.
Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year, "so that you can feel like a restaurant at home as well."
One of the popular bento menu items is the "fried seasonal fish and shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
The fish is selected from the best of the moment at the market.
"For deep-fried prawns, raw breadcrumbs are made as thin as possible so that the texture of the ingredients can be understood," says Takayuki, and the plump texture of deep-fried prawns can be understood directly.
The lunch box comes with about four kinds of vegetables and deli, rice mixed with Hinohikari from Saga Prefecture, rice with minor grains, and soup.
Vegetables are sourced in-house from the buckwheat fields and at direct sales outlets in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the time of year, but Takayuki is trained in French cuisine, and latte and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, according to Yumi, it is a blend of Japanese and Western cuisine that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with a "relaxing taste that is used to eating" like a dashi-maki egg.
The lunch box "Domestic Aibiki Niku no Tegone Hamburger" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, we will also release a processed meat product "Charcuterie Set" that goes well with alcohol such as wine.

There was an interesting one at Haneda Airport that I happened to stop by, so I tried using it.
The ride is not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not enough to get drunk)
Speed, of course slow.
Safety When there are people around me, I slowed down, and in some cases it stopped completely, so I think it's safe for the time being, but I thought it was dangerous in some places
The gaze around it hurts, it is good to be seen in itself, but it hurts my heart to be seen as "disturbing"
Overall rating It's not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It is a pity that it will be easy to use if there are a little less people or consideration such as having them approach the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create a dedicated lane so that it would not get in the way of other people walking.
However, I thought that it would be a good vehicle if there were a little less people because it was relaxing and I could relax while watching the scenery.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a very patient mind that is comfortable with the excitement caused by the near-future feeling that this kind of automated driving will become mainstream in the future and the pain of the surrounding gaze.
Damn shameful.

If you look closely, you may see that they don't use any eels at all.

I like eel, but I thought that the texture and quantity of eel are important if I thought that the eel part could be anything other than the actual degree of baking just because everyone is eating it with sauce ...

At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s in Fukuoka Prefecture was stabbed with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s and 40s on the street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, and his face was injured.

A family's long journey to entrench environmental protection activities in frontier China (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato, a corporate consultant at Find Asia, a Hong Kong company) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest number of mammal species and the world's third largest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and are promoting the activities of environmental activists as well as environmental protection carried out by local governments.
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such area.
Sisapanna is a border region between Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people, who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flows.
Sisapanna Thai Autonomous Prefecture Sisapanna has an area of only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of wild animals and 20% of plants.
This time, I met Mr. Li Minhua, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and talked about the content of the activities.
Started environmental protection activities with my German husband ――I heard that you have been doing environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What inspired you to do that?
Ms. Lee Our environmental protection activity, Tenran, started in 2000.
It all started with my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China science project.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted one of the highest biodiversity.
But on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
For this reason, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests has progressed in the past in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
It was here that I got to know and married a reporter.
Before that, did you not have any interest in nature conservation?
Ms. Lee I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though they do not have a well-formed face or are not particularly tall. Why do you think?

I wonder if it is fine to say that the other person's clothes are homey or the color is good?
It's not fine, is it?
I can see it though.
I think it is not fine.
I have never been complimented and told that it is fine, so I do not know what it means a little.
I wonder if he praised it in detail.
What would you do if Yokomine Sakura confessed to you?
"Sakura confessed to me, and my heart is in full bloom in the spring, so I would like you to do the same," I replied, and we dated.
And to associate, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what we like with each other.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to?
The procedure will be completed faster if you open it at the same time.
Now it takes about a week.
We recommend that you open a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it because there is no fee.

One thought on the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing-after today's home care
I have been receiving home care for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, but I have a long relationship with the nurse (female) at the home care station I am currently using, and I think I have built a very good relationship.
Every week, we talk about various things.
Of course, he will do what is necessary for medication management (packaging, etc.), but above all, I realized how important fun communication is for people with mental illness through today's home nursing.
Today, we had a chat about gender differences between men and women, or gender theory, lol.
We will also talk about the libido of men and women, why she got divorced, and whether it is okay to do such home nursing.
Sometimes, I dress as a woman.
However, I have heard from an acquaintance that in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only handles clerical work, or an occupational therapist comes in as a home-visit nurse and gives instructions from above, saying, “We are doing medical care.”
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think it is a really good nurse who addresses me frankly on an equal footing with me who has a mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing, and some of you may be thinking about receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves it, you should definitely take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent is one-fifth of China's "delay in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (CNA) - Yahoo!
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap.
The plan called for the spread of 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative total) by 2022 and the operation of 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of hydrogen is 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only at the target level of 27% (about 17,000 units).
The target date for the spread of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was released.
It was found that the government’s implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is far below the target.
The National Federation of Economic Organizations (Zenkeiren) last week released a report on the current state of the hydrogen economy ecosystem and policy direction.
According to the report, most of the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
Carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray Industries (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane membrane membranes by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) have seen an average annual increase of 14% in hydrogen technology patents (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative).
However, the Japan Business Federation (Zenkeiren) said, “In effect, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, and in fact, they are at the bottom of the list of competing countries.”
The patent ranking by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan in that order.
The gap has widened since China overtook the United States to become No. 1 since 2017.
South Korea ranked fourth in the number of patents registered in 2020, surpassing Japan (974) with 1,033, compared to 22 percent of China (4721).
“Hydrogen technology should be designated as a ‘national strategic technology’ with a large tax credit for capital investment and research and development expenses,” the Federation said.

Can I get money for volunteer work?
Some idiots misunderstand that volunteers have to be free

Was your older sister's wife a minority in the Meiji and Showa periods compared to today?
I think there were a lot of older sister wives.
Because the word "older sister's wife" has come to be said in the public.
In the old days we were told to look for a wife who was one year older than us, even if it meant wearing gold straw sandals, so I think that there were many wives who were older than us in the Meiji and Showa periods.

Is it a crime for a shop to sell things at a higher price than the list price?
PS5 was selling at the store today for 70,000 yen.
It's legal.
It's free competition, so, for example, if a branded product has more rarity value than the list price.
For example, it's legal for a painter to be famous and the price to rise.
The fact that Ps5 is sold at a high price is also a rarity, and it's only worth more than the list price

Parliament on Sunday?
Composition of a flyer in the style of a TV program Congressional reform is underway in Takasu, MP's "report book" is also: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic edition
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as the creation of wacky flyers to guide the holding of regular meetings and the introduction of a "report book" in which the townspeople evaluate the members.
The aim of the town council election is to interest the townspeople by not voting for a third consecutive term.
In order to inform the public of the Sunday congress held on the 12th, about 1800 leaflets of the new work were distributed by newspaper folding on the 9th.
"Raw Gillon from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Hitoshi Sawaguchi Exploration Series" ....
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th is full of words reminiscent of a popular TV program name.
Member of Parliament Hyoe Katayama, 43, said, “I want you to come to Parliament with a chuckle.”

U.S. Aid Arms and Ammunition Arrives in Ukraine (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo!News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials said Tuesday that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid is worth $60 million, and the last piece of equipment, including four radars to locate mortars and other launch sites, will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
The aid included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile, according to U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kirby.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the U.S. would provide additional defensive capabilities to Ukraine in response to Russia’s military buildup near the Ukrainian border.
The Kremlin said the U.S. would impose "strong economic and other measures" on Russia if it invaded Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during his visit to the White House on Sept. 1.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia annexed Crimea, the total amount of aid has been more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the U.S. National Guard was dispatched to Florida in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan in support of Ukraine.
The U.S. Special Operations Command in Europe has also played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a confidential matter in the execution of the operation.
Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.
The U.S. is prepared to impose severe economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.

The whereabouts of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes gifts "forbidden" during his lifetime, hitting Akira Amari, the former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of Weekly Diamond was "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!
It is a gift and rush inheritance technique during life".
As the debate on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax progresses, it was postponed in the 2022 Tax Reform Outline, which was a concern, but in the near future, it is highly likely that gifting during life, which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Along with a direct hit to the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission and a member of the House of Representatives Akira Amari, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifting and inheritance to tax saving techniques for cheap last-minute gifts in time for the year.
(Hiroaki Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
"From the point of view of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale consideration toward the establishment of a tax system that is neutral to the choice of the timing of asset transfer."
Last year, the ruling party announced a draft tax reform outline for fiscal 2021, which caused a major upheaval not only among property owners but also among the middle class.
This is because it means a major increase in inheritance tax by completely changing the rules of inheritance and making "gifts during life," which are the royal road to inheritance tax measures, "forbidden hands".
An iron rule of progressive inheritance tax saving measures is to "reduce taxable property."
The most powerful trump card, the gift in his lifetime, has been widely used not only by wealthy people, but also by office workers who are subject to inheritance tax even if it is a small amount because they have their homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of all this, the debate over the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax arose.
Although it was postponed in the FY2022 Tax Reform Outline announced on December 10, when there was concern about the fastest introduction, the policy for integration was reiterated with more in-depth wording, such as “reviewing the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar year gift system” and “gift tax exemption measures are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit ...
Akira Amari, the former chairman of the LDP’s Tax Research Council and former secretary-general, told this editorial department.
“The most important thing is to lose the advantages and disadvantages due to the timing of property transfer and to make the tax burden the same no matter when you go.
At present, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (due to integration).”
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future there will be a major change in the direction of invalidating gifts during life as a tax saving measure.
So how exactly will the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Righteous Brother" terrestrial broadcasting from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa "Please expect it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight January 10, 2022.
Based on the manga of the same name by Satoshi Morie, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018, this work is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman carrying the past.
Furukawa serves as the main character's sailor, and Yamatani Kajun serves as the heroine's Riyo.
Riyo, a university student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is an enigmatic young man who can sleep soundly if he borrows Riyo's shoulder for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has a resemblance to her older brother, who was separated due to the divorce of her parents, but is Kairi a murderer for some reason?
Comment from Yudai Furukawa The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial from January 10th!
For those who were not able to see it at FOD, I would like you to look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I think that you can get to know this work more deeply if you know the development and see the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Riyo, and the state of the two people who are conflicted and changing.
I hope that fans of the original will enjoy it as well.
Please stay tuned!

How did the players feel? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in the game.
This was the lowest number of passes in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills scored twice against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
In 1974, the Bills had O.J. Simpson, the first player in history to exceed 2,000 yards in a season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with a run by Simpson and another running back Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots had such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido in latitude.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius and the wind speed was 18 meters per hour, and a blizzard was blowing before the game.
The Bills were local and did not change their play choices very much.
He scored 25 runs against 30 passes.
Allen's passes were 15/30 and 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was never bad.
There were four red zone incursions in the 10 offensive series, and the scoring machine.
They reached the red zone three times in a row from the end of the third quarter onwards.
However, they were only able to score three points in the third inning.
Defending before the goal in the final stage of the game.
The Bills scored four runs in a 3rd & 9 penalty to make it 3rd & 14.
It is 18 yards to the goal.
In the 3rd & 14th, QB Allen came out of the pocket and flowed to the right, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defense.
He threw a pass intended for TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
Stéphane Diggs, ace WR who was on the outside right, was free in front of the end zone when he ran the Charoir Across, but it seems that Allen did not see it.
In the fourth and eighteenth innings, Allen attempted to pass WR Gabriel Davis, who ran from outside the left into the end zone, but was hit by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in the foreground and failed.
Bryant covered Bills WR Cole Beasley on a one-on-one basis, but when he saw Allen's movement on the way, he released Beasley and reacted to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw a pass intended for the end zone on both occasions.
The 4th down pass may have been decisive, but the 3rd down did not need to aim for TD.
He scored the first down in two games.
It was before the second minute, so if it was 4th & Short, Allen's ability, which had his own run, should have lived.

Three items that tend to be placed in the kitchen for a long period of time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often it is changed, perhaps the sponge is not replaced as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges reproduce a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (but it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
German researchers who did this study recommend changing sponges once a week to keep them clean.
Cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that cutting boards should be replaced when they start to fray and have scratches and grooves.
Once the wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria grow.
If you’re still okay, don’t forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and put a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or cracked tableware
Disposing of your favorite mug may hurt your chest, but the chipped surface will be a new hotbed for bacteria and bacteria.
In addition, it can cause lips to be cut and drinks to spill on the chipped area.
That's right, it's your chance to buy your new favorite mug!

Community markets and trade are two different things
Community markets use Steam's payment system.
This feature allows you to conduct cash transactions with complete strangers, so some people fall victim to scams where they only take items without paying.
That doesn't happen.
Trade is a function that allows you to exchange items or present them as gifts, and there is no buying and selling function.
Is the profession and employment type a different story?
Rather, I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
There are cases of unskilled work and full-time work, intellectual work and non-regular work.
Help FlashBIOS won't finish
I bought the Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced it with the B550 I bought in September and Tomaho.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and rebooted, a white cursor-like dot did not blink on the black screen and I was in a state where I was accepted all the time.
I thought that the BIOS was damaged and tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it will be over in about five minutes, but it won't end in an hour.
Maybe it's because the USB memory I tried is too old and the one who converts and uses the SD card.
Is Tomaho crazy because he's sleeping too much?
Is there any other possible cause for that?
You don't like a man with a straight face all the time?
Ah! I knew someone.
He always looked like Vagabond.

For some reason, I’m embarrassed to have branded goods.
If it’s unobtrusive, you can have it, but you can’t have something like Vuitton that says Lv in monogram.
Why is that?
I think it is good that it suits your height.
By the way, in Japan, I think it is good.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
It's better to say as soon as possible, "Why am I the only one to call it quits / slapstick?"
If you think that it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, you should simply say that it's uncomfortable.
I don't think I've ever dreamed I'd be uncomfortable with a decent probability.
I lived abroad on the way, but the Japanese who went outside, including me, hated the Confucian practices of the upper and lower echelons, and there were quite a few people who misunderstood that they could say anything to the local people whether the tag came off.
If you look like a Westerner, I think that you are doing so with a kind of pampering or good-natured feeling rather than purely malicious.
My friends in Europe and the United States call me by my first name, but when I speak in Japanese, I sometimes wonder which one to choose.
Well, if it's a friend, it's still good.
Originally it's purely normal, but if you overlook it, you may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because it's Gaijin, so it's better to say it right now.
I was wondering if you could talk about it according to Japanese rules because it is Japan
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise a glass higher than other younger people when they toast at a drinking party.
I’m definitely aware of it, but I think it’s a good habit because if you do that, you won’t be teased by younger and older people, or you’ll be treated like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of their character, are shitty people (including me) who look at such details

Thanks for the 50 subscribers!
When I opened reddit today, this sable, which I just made, had surpassed 50 subscribers.
I’m so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer for 50 people to go, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today alone, so I am very grateful.
If you have subscribed to this sable today, I would be grateful if you could tell me where you learned about this sable in the comment section!(I'm really worried because I don't know it)
Currently, I am the only one who is making a thread, so I would be grateful if everyone could make a thread.
Even if you don’t put up a thread, it’s encouraging if you make comments.
Maybe I use reddit but few people use twitter.
If you’re using Twitter, please feel free to put up a thread too!
Last but not least, thank you very much!The sable that I made before was thwarted immediately because people did not gather as I expected, but this time it seems that I can continue without setbacks thanks to everyone.
I will do my best to make Sabre easy to use by developing wikis and rules, so thank you for your continued support!

I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and if you are a small company, I feel that you are a well-translated person.
I think it is possible for non-native speakers of Japanese to understand the subtle nuances of Japanese even after studying for a long period of time.
I do not know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level where Japanese people do not feel uncomfortable, it would be a good idea to look for another person.

Consideration "Kimetsu no Yaiba" Training is Battle.
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human hymn <Anime "Yukaku Hen" Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent shonen manga, "Kimetsu no Yaiba" is particularly different in that "there is a lot of training".
It is generally accepted that there is no battle, and that the training version, which trains day and night, is not popular with readers.
In the same jump manga ONE PIECE, he trained for two years when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, but he drew only the touch and skipped the rest dynamically, so you should know.
Well, one of the charms of Wampi is the eccentricity of the land where you move around, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
Now, it can be said that the training of Sumijiro, the main character of "Kimetsu no Yaiba", began when Yoshitake Tomioka, who saved his life, knelt down on his knees and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, and was told by Yoshitake, "Don't let others hold the right to life, death, and deprivation!"
The weak have no right or choice, they can only be defeated by the strong by force ....
Having said that, he introduced Sakonji Rintaki, a "cultivator" who trains those who wish to join the Onimutai, to the kindness of volunteers (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intention).
Sumijiro's first contact with Rintaki is when he is asked, "What will you do if your sister eats people?"
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of talk among fans.
However, walking around with my sister who has become an ogre carries the possibility that a moment may come when I will be forced to make such a judgment.
It can be said that it is an initiative to enter training from a mental attitude.
However, Rindaki takes Sumijiro, a layman who has not yet trained, to Mount Sagiri, and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air in the mountain is thin and full of pitfalls, trebuchets, and traps, and I'm about to die before I start training.
Even so, it is barely "main character correction" to sniff out the faint smell of the trap set by human hands with his sharp sense of smell and somehow avoid it.
Still, it is the essence that makes the demons disappear that Sumijiro says, “That doesn’t mean that the physical ability suddenly gets high enough to avoid all of it!”
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any corroboration, and waking up will only allow them to use the "power and skills they have honed so far" at their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards those who make efforts, and rewards those who do not, is a human anthem that is different from demons who have unfounded paranormal powers, and it is an unmovable rule that is consistent with this work.
Is this old?
Not yet The way of sleeping is to lay a mat directly on the house, not a bed, and sleep on a futon or quilt.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I am doing that too.
If you are going to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are many people like that as well.
Are you clinging to it?
If you work part-time and want to work full-time, are you obsessed with working with other stores?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, I don't think it's what I think is "sticky".
I think it is “sticky” to plot to somehow get more profit than effort with minimum effort.
Are there any smoking cessation outpatient clinics around the country now?

Samsung Electronics (South Korea) Establishes DX Division to Integrate Home Appliances and Mobile to Emphasize User Experience ( WoW!Korea ) - Yahoo! News
Samsung Electronics announced on December 12 that it will merge the CE and IM divisions as a set, and will name it DX (Device eXperience) to reflect this in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
You can see the intention to enhance the user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics said the new DX division, which was formed by integrating the CE and IM divisions, will consist of divisions such as VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
"This name change reflects the company's medium- to long-term business structure, future-orientedness, and strengthened global leadership," said a Samsung Electronics official.
He also emphasized his intention to make it easier for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and telecommunications equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the name also reflects the company’s strategy of going beyond organizational boundaries to create synergies on a company-wide scale and build a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is already devising a strategy through the Multi-Device Experience (MDE) Council to allow users to freely use content and services through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

What will happen if you say in Japanese?

BC means Before Christ, but in recent years, it has been increasingly written as BCE based on the idea that consideration is given to people other than Christians.
BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era.

It's a bit unnatural here.
The larvae ambush in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, leaving only the disc-shaped head peeking out of the sand.
I think it should be.
What bothers me is
• Did you refer to other documentaries?
Looking at it from an ant's perspective.
Is it?
If you translate armoured heads as disc-shaped heads, I think that the part that "it is a giant beast wearing a helmet on an ant scale" will disappear ...
"Trailer driver has no chronic illness - TV Asahi (ANN) - Yahoo!
In an accident in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, 24 cars collided, and the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office had no chronic illness, and it was found that the accident was caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, 54, who was driving a trailer on suspicion of injuring a 71-year-old man in the first rear-end collision, and sent him to the prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to advance without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura did not have a chronic illness and was believed to have been caused by some carelessness.
Police are searching the home of the person concerned and investigating the situation in detail at that time.

Oginuma X no Kinnikuman Review [Comics Vol.4] (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started with volume 3, will be completed with this volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicts everything from the opening to the semi-finals at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focuses only on one match!
Vol.4 "Kinnikuman" Reviewer Oginuma X★★★★★ (five out of five stars) Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the game!
In a nutshell, this is a book that carefully depicts the final of Kinnikuman vs. Robin Mask, but first of all, I would like to keep in mind that this is not just a book about the game on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, the battle to keep each other in check and the scene of special training, it is difficult to go to the game unlike before, but that is never boring.
This feeling in the work, in which the tension gradually increases as the battle of the century finally begins, certainly leads to an increase in the tension of the reader, and I admire that even this period is a really calculated production.
And one more mountain before the important finals, you can't miss the third place game between Terryman vs. Ramenman.
As well as the gorgeousness as a competitive card, what I like is that before the game, Ramenman turned to Kinnikuman’s poster and said, “From now on, it’s my turn to aim!”
And I'm trying to beat the chop.
However, there is a scene where a terrier who happens to pass by takes the sword and stops it, silently stares at each other, and the place breaks up just by that.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and there is no more opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a person in agony over that Kinnikuman.
If I can see such a thing, I can't help but think about the activities of the distant future!
As a manga artist, I still feel keenly that this is what it means to have a character!
The fight between the two ends without taking much time, but the famous scene is the appeal of the tears of the ramen man after the game.
“Don’t rely only on the strength of divine luck!”
It is a line.
This is a grand meta remark on the work itself, and I think that readers have felt that Kinnikuman is not to be outdone because he is the main character in the end, and that he has somehow won in a place that is not his ability.
However, by having the ramen man make this statement, the boiled egg teacher stabbed the nail that he could not use that hand anymore ahead of himself.
In a statement, the reader said, "Well, is Kinnikuman going to defeat Robin by force?
How? "
When you look at it from an author's point of view, this is a line as if the boiled egg teacher who makes the work imposed a constraint on himself.
I thought this was an amazing thing.
I think it is definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Aobayama, Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting Corporation) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is wrapped in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illuminations, which began on November 26, are studded with 50,000 LED bulbs along the promenade and lawn, including a 20-meter-high camphor tree.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time and was surprised to find such a place.
It's very beautiful and I'm relieved."
The illuminations were planned for the first time to give people a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and are lit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday until December 25th.
There will also be a Christmas event on the 25th, the last day of the festival, where a button pot will be served and a movie will be screened.

Online Distribution, Agricultural and Livestock ProductsOrganizer "Okitama Agricultural Promotion Cooperative" Broadcast from Yonezawa|Yamagata Shimbun
The Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which is made up of municipalities in the Okitama area and the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA), conducted PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using live commerce, which sells products while distributing videos on the Internet, on November 11.
Yamagata Ai's warlord corps made a remote appearance on Minato Market TV, the first of its kind in Minato-ku, Tokyo, and delivered the charm of the region along with local specialties.
The "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," a collaboration between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, led to the decision to open a store, which was relayed from Satoyama Vision House in Minamiharashinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "satoyama sommelier", wore a stole from the Yonezawa-ori brand "nitorito" and introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
Together with the military commanders of love, he also delivered the state of Imonikai.
At the studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and more than 300,000 YouTubers sampled Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, etc.
When I told viewers how delicious it was, they raved about it, saying, "I can smell it even though it's a broadcast," and "It's the best with a lot of delicious things in sake."

At this time, the PC is energized.
When I came back to my room after a while, I noticed a pink rotor-like sound from my PC and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the deceleration of room temperature (6 °C) was only causing the fan to move poorly.
So I decided to try again after warming the room.
3.) Without starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on for a moment and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I won't say anything at all.
Unplug the power plug and try again, but it turns on only for a moment after all.
Connect the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pin only, remove the other parts and try it, but it does not start.
PSU fans seem to have been hitting something for a while, and I suspect that PSU is the cause because there was a buzzing sound.

Ranking of most used emoji in 2021 (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo!

So, I wonder what kind of emoji everyone uses.
Top 10 Most Used Emoji in 2021 The Top 10 Most Used Emoji in the World in 2021!
Overall, positive and bright emoji are ranked.
According to Unicode, 92% of the world's Internet population uses emoji.
First place accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
First, third and fifth place crying and laughing emoji are very easy to use, aren't they?
Of course, when it's funny or happy, I did it!
I think there are quite a few people who use it masochistically even when they feel like they can't do anything.
On the contrary, those who have never used the top 10 emoji are rare among rare.
I want you to stick to that style.
