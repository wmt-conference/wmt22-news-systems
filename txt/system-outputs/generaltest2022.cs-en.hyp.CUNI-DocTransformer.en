A big comeback for the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz has been called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is coming back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old fullback will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns in the middle of the Vegas game and has not been on the NHL ice rinks since.
The incident occurred while the veteran goaltender was moving from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in his lower body,” the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, US time, he was called up from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The fullback wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not catch a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, “Francouz” made 36 saves, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles wears a mask on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles has also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC has reported on its website.
They send their wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte is also dressed.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is dressed like Princes George and Louis in shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photo, William and Kate have not said, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask, helps Camilla put on her veil, which matches her light-coloured dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbr a million crowns for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, having been promised a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season by Slavia in Prague.
The efotbal.cz news server reported that he had accessed some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red-and-whites had not committed any corrupt acts.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, which mainly include Slavia's former sports director, Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
The former influential red-and-whites official, according to the file, was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to be promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the case file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of Slavia Tvrdík's board of directors.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the case file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We never committed illegal acts, did not seek to influence referees in violation of fair play rules and did not provide any financial compensation to anyone in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, Nezmar is indiscriminately insulting some of Slavia's former dark-skinned players and he is also slandering his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by police intervention in several places, including the FAČR's Prague headquarters, in mid-October last year.
The highest-ranking player in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are Cold War larping.
The guns will be new, but essentially of a worse type (artillerymen have to carry cartridges manually without cover from the armored cabin).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they've already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I have a hunting trip right next to town.
Nutria were coming out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
As I was coming in, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came out, but of course the fox went after a while.
I let it come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got down from the perch, he was gone.
I.e. Even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of many things for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So in a visible place, expensive things to put at your feet in a sleeping bag and you'd be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Internal Affairs got respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for buying and distributing masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in the past weeks.
iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts per respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I'm probably not affected by memories of ČSLA, which passed through older generations), but the Czech Republic can't benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that the trained could take up, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the reservists' abilities will be rapidly lost in time.
Moreover, modern conventional conflicts, where one can deploy them, will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be fought in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we don't have the appropriate geography for it.
mainly we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is half of them play like they have one.
Then there's this situation where you're looking at a dude who missed an empty goal two minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss guys and you're thinking "wow and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well of course they're going to take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "catching a defender" is so horrible that I found myself genuinely surprised to see that our attacker managed to play one player off his opponent.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals will last for some time, according to statistical models, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the current Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it may cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from previous disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent from the results so far.
But the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronaviral pandemic, highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the incoming drugs.
As said, Merck’s molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up on the tape first because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beak has grown."
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you flatly that they don't.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid to cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they will find out what people really think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both polled at over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the spinning of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that sssr did not want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads because of the more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some supporting device.
Apart from the museum maple, the remaining ones are in disrepair.
In the second grade we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed too much, but he was our kind of mascot.
Everyone talked to him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was very close, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't steal phones, he went clean-clothed.
He went to school in nature, he did all kinds of monkey business, but he was cool, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Gypsies joined the same class, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, there was often something handled by the police, they threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on the advert (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I have sold often to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to trick me into a price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car that way, the guy called in a month that he had already signed it over to himself..
I say myself that I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just common behavior).
But if someone comes in, reaches out, vacates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes problems.. so it doesn't matter what color he is, but he will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, as long as they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs too.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachaticko
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation care unfortunately she died of her injuries at the scene," South Bohemian Health Rescue spokesperson Zuzana Fajtlová told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet determined, he went around a bend in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian Police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovicka, according to the Rescue Officer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often don't provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector says.
Since October, ordering small packages has become slightly more expensive, he has to add VAT and send the data to the post office for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then he just has to fill in the data about the shipment, and if VAT was not included by the trader at the time of the sale, the customs office will charge it from the total amount for the shipment and for the transport.
If the addressee does not ensure customs clearance himself, the reward to the carrier must be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of incoming shipments from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for data to be supplied that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that are needed and filled in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Dealing with inflation
See the headline, how would you propose dealing with current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and fuel, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford the usual things, especially energy.
How much did you get, say, a raise (who is the employee)?
I got 2% this year in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for even 6 months?
I just don't get it, how can a court send such an animal to prison for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape reports from victims?
The man from the Grave "burnt through" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had called them to her himself.
But he took a detour.
First he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling 911 and were surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the officers on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide manhunt, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Police.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally am of the opinion that we are not Slavic ethnically or culturally any longer, but I would like your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something without any evidence, just because it could potentially be of benefit.
I wouldn't personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are probably, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even the Ten Commandments say there is no other god than Yahve.
In that case, wouldn't it be more rational to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of those thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed sending me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I believe.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per year) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All elements of the Czech Armed Forces could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: There is a constant rehash of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies hunt in schools and there is a kind of blending, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions into employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is ongoing all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian raider.
​I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a screw-up.
Oh dear.
Just one election in the USA that cuts their budget and the whole NATO goes to shit.
The limeys will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown once that they just have to show their back and take what they want.
The only thing that has worked as a guarantor of independence in the long term is the armed army to the teeth and the population that can control the military technology of their time.
And nowadays any teenager can pilot remote controlled devices, so what can it do.
We don't need border fortifications, that sucks today, but a pimply teenager behind the stick of a remote controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Unwrap your presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're stuffed with boxes and fillers at home?
This "waste" is being reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers to the involved shop (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging cartons have increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugstore and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are together creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauties of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tyres, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large volume waste, etc.).
All the garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPy and other places help to find uses for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily" adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean up the Czech Republic.
What I find wrong is that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying folder filesystem and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let’s Rewrite History, Seriously
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of France’s EU presidency over the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they are impossible to do in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron’s supporters straddling right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for a head of state in April.
The election calendar has affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe,” and France is ready to create the conditions for such historian work.
Many commentators rushed to criticize Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is trying to defend the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now, arguing that the Vichy regime, which colluded with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has had quite a success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea for one history textbook seriously, and let's not look at what happens in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as an us-versus-them story, and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it held the top spot in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhoea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)

Trains start running according to the new timetable, some carriers will change
Starting on Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will start running instead of ČD.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route slightly.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
Carriers have started selling tickets already during the autumn.
ČD plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
The trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Alongside domestic services under the new timetable, the lines will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will run other new trains in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the entry on line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
On the line, RegioJet will run a total of 16 connections daily, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, as well as a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned closure works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
For example, passengers are awaiting changes in Českolipsko, where the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be replaced by Czech Railways by German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex trains.
Passengers will also be able to use a single railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, they died.
I've never heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, nobody defends this, only condemns it.
Nobody even tells you in the schools that the blacks were often sold into slavery by the blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
Nobody teaches you in the school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they just tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right in the schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I didn't see anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history isn't black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn it without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do that again.
By the way, speaking of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good successes, too, and it seemed absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North wasn't much better, as a lot of people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was a slaver, and they hated a lot of things, too.
I wouldn't compare that to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and our point of view may not exist with them (there was a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was appalling, those students were quite radicalized and those schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I am a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer the same, it has radicalized itself.
Nowadays, feminists are called those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, so other groups like LGBT themselves, and it leads to radicalization on the other side as well, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, in conclusion, I didn't encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I encountered rather bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I didn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some bullshit about the coronavirus that everybody's ashamed of.
Then of course there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they're Protestants, but in fact they're born out of Catholic modernity and they're effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to services with the Hussites because it's theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanicka Street.
Otherwise St. Michael's Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even do a Latin mass there every Sunday at 3:00, like they did before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for it because of the coronavirus pandemic, but took it from their Austrian colleagues in the morning at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
They also took it at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we take part in with the troop every year, I am looking forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav in the parking lot.
But usually scouts take the train to Vienna for it.
Nothing changes about the delivery of the flame around the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The subsequent delivery of the light on Saturday, 18 December will be taken care of by the Scout couriers, who will travel by selected express trains as well as by passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken in the stations by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame around the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Scouts must adhere to the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of the local events to of course wear masks, try to keep the intervals, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem Light is for believers a symbol of hope, light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event involves hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will put the money to good use, but I don't understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it's producing a useless product and it's eroding the free market and "the natural life of the company."
I work in a factory myself where there are a million signs in the corridors "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development where this company is just hanging on and taking away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolute agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age gets caught up in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don't move me, but then I catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so clever that you can't always help it.
For this reason too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to put a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something the majority believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I'll claim is a cryptic thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has fallen in love with the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen in love with the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will present a record of more than two hundred to their audiences at the premiere.
The IMDb film database operator has calculated this.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring well with audiences in recent years and has been increasing the audience significantly, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year there were four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so realistically there will be many more holiday films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period, and films such as Home Alone, Love in Heaven and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real Christmas boom didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC recalled.
Its advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22, and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
This year, the rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't really matter, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, the author of a book about Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, describing the genre with exaggeration.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," added Gray.
For example, according to Gray, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which of course is resolved and the two of them kiss.
It goes on and on, and as long as all the films look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, adds Gray.
Mazepin tested positive for covid-19, will not be involved in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not be involved in the final race of the season.
Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he should have been attacking the better position from the 20th position he took in qualifying.
However, Russia's Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not be involved in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in the end.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen, taking on Lewis Hamilton in a straight battle for the title.
Mazepin, according to Haas, is relatively well and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically well because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
Any replacement would have to go through qualifying or driving at another part of the weekend.
There is no first driver involved with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the season just ending, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You can also be arrested for this.
And no one will care that the boss said.
According to the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater stuns!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in my home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater its softness," says the creator, who does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states, in connection with months-long actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory. _____________________________________________________________________________
The Omicron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
The health department is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
“We are currently reporting another suspected variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school is not proven,” said Ciupek.
Six cases occurred in the region during the week.
“We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the director.
She added that there are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital in Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, and four have a asymptomatic course.
No one with a suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of those mentioned has traveled abroad, nor has any of their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, said Ciupek.
The chief health officer, Pavla Svrčinová, said earlier that an international water polo tournament that was held in Brno a few weeks ago is being examined.
Players from South Africa were there, and a Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales.
It wants to do like Texas on abortion bans.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which kept Texas' abortion ban in place, albeit going against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the U.S. up to roughly 24 months of pregnancy.
The court, however, was now ruling not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Indeed, enforcement of the ban in this case has been made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Texas' ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect people's lives," Newsom continues.
He says he has instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the secretary of justice on a measure that would authorize public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are labeled.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to claim at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute, or sell assault rifles, components for "ghost weapons," or sets for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional in June.
If the state were to now reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern US state. _____________________________________________________________________________________
Every emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where you gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule is going to look like and you also improve the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4 dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on inactivated virus, which promises up to 10 times more potency according to the manufacturer's specifications, should be on the market soon.

Poland Threatens to Stop Payments to EU Budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw €36 billion from the EU recovery fund for economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Poland's judiciary underwent under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, puts "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw faces "political dictates carried out by blackmail and by trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels as to limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But knowing about it... In Lidl they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yoghurt too many times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes on the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they had all selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and lactose-free zone...
If there's no need, I won't go to any more market, action or no action, golden shop in the square, maybe they don't have that kind of choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and there's an order to it, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't really care anymore.
For two years I've watched data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more off the mark than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion is going on at the technical level, but only extreme views are getting into the public arena.

Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analysis.

Ew, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day to you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the spoon and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get hit a few times on the butt (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than to words.
The important part, I think, is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice in its own way whether to disobey and get it, or to be better and there will be no punishment.
In the end, I mostly just needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the System
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether the sacred charter to which he was sworn and about which he had been taught in school since childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement which could be changed if necessary, he was decidedly in favour of the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and are better spared with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl gloated at the time.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
Among other things, the Constitution is a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians to bans.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in Brno University Hospital they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, they speak about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place in the clinic of paediatric infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
In hospitals there are also children in a severe condition due to coronavirus.
"Currently, a child of several months and adolescent age is lying with us," said the head physician.
He is pleased, however, that there have not been any childhood deaths from coronavirus at the children's hospital FN Brno.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years have died in the Czech Republic as of December 6.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend vaccination in children as well," added the doctor.
In the rest zone you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones are not that big.
They are visible on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game preserve).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside of marked roads is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course outside national parks it is not so much guarded).

He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of controlled contagion and authoritarian regime facing crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of controlled contagion and authoritarian regime facing crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to stop a contagion that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, including in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support, or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says: do you want an elephant?
I've got one and it's great.
The wife is happy because she eats grass, she washes the car with her trunk, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000,- I'll sell you an elephant.
A friend: all right, high five, it'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, giant shit everywhere, the car is sitting down, the kids are scared of it and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold says: you talk bad about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will succeed.
It occurred to me, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on English, so maybe I'm quibbling.
I'm just basing it on the fact that the ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
I'll borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it's clear that they're both from Spain, whereas "Spanish fruit and mandarins" are no longer clear that they're from Spain.
I'm basing it on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect it's already covered in the broad term, and there's no need to specify it further for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just quibbling :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before being flushed down and laughed at by its heartless owner.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned it from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who look after Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon again.
The mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates Court, she was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and has to pay the equivalent of £12,000 in legal costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: 'Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.'
It took Milly time to get used to humans again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her flat on a drug charge.
In the footage Milly can be heard swearing in a vulgar manner.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying: 'Do you want cocaine?'
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her home, £1,600 worth of cocaine (less than $50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take away the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of cramming, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
Just take the test to one, and then no one cares.
Go out and ask randomly people on the street if they can figure out the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't give a shit and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't need.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the lot of people who are going to need that particular thing.
But, like, I was totally serious about saying that you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is a punk sign.
(Which in our country probably includes our communist past and our rampage against the educated and the elite) But the cost of having barbarians stand by those machines is just high.
If journalists could count, for example, the covid here probably never reached this size.
Marriage at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland now," Andrea responded on Instagram in Stories to prying questions from curious fans about what had disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
Things had been grinding between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused to do so.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect, even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri fumed in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife did not appeal to his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment at all on such things, and even in the family, we've never said these things to each other very much.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone who tries to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would dearly like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but most importantly, we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he ended up stealing less than 330 kroner from one vehicle.
Then he could think of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana as he did so.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
They subsequently arrested Cao.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And because he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and tied in effect to the Pandemic Emergency.
If it is repealed, the Act will not be effective.
The Act does limit the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not repealed.
More than 60 % of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils fell apart.
On Saturday, 99 candidates ran for a total of 28 mandates.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said ČSÚ Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komní na Uherskohradišťsko, Saturday's elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two mandates.
The Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
The incumbent mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privately.
The Komňans – independent candidates – achieved one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In Rovná na Pelhřimovsku, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 went to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lužice na Mostecku again.
It won 56.73 percent of the votes and, as in 2018, it has four seats in the seven-member council.
The Municipality for the People candidate came second, with 43.27 percent of voters voting, and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nova Ves na Liberecko were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nova Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the Association of Independent Candidates, thus gaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, winning one more seat and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to "argue" with.
If you don't, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I do care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
The incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
The workers of the regional operations center took over an hour after Saturday midnight emergency call with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – went to the scene immediately.
Upon arrival at the scene, the paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vítkovice, the coal caught fire.
But not as well as it should and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airway, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman of ZZS MS of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus because of inadequate reactions from the public and authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the disease is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA had a spectacular gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña was able to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, he produced a great choke hold against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one had expected.
This was the women's bantamweight bout between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the fight as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes had not lost in seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to knock her down.
Peña, however, was not compelled to make any more mistakes, and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with a hand lever.
The second round was riveting, and for MMA fans very tense.
Both opponents came up with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Peña got Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up and knock the attack off.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier did better, but gradually the tables began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
He didn't do that very well, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and hit him with a series of punches.
That was how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the choke off.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed a supreme triumph, putting a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of accurate shots and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to take on Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it is not complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical genus, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the genus is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When declensing, they then take on double endings and in some cases remain in the non-tilted form.
For example, the words “lump” or “hip” are masculine and feminine, in the former they are declensing according to the pattern “machine”, in the latter according to the pattern “song”.
For another group of nouns, different shapes are already in the first instance of the singular, for example: “line/line”, “kodluben/kodlubna” or “potato/potato” (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-scriptural, similarly to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "doughnut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally non-inclined, but they gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image" which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet" which has remained non-inclined in the middle genus, but has endings in masculine according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to come to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
Tensions are running high on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have started to make their way towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What exactly motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation right on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we choked, describes Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to have to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who've been raped and I've seen how those people are often treated by their environment or even by the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
The trend has been that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusation is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Buildings under construction flood the Czech Republic, families have no money to finish
Prices of construction materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have found themselves in a precarious situation because of this.
They do not have the means to finish the family houses under construction and banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move into houses under construction and not under construction.
In a worse case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and to pay rent on top of that," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and for fifty percent, this has happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even though the materials have become more expensive.
So we are working without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the construction of the house costing them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," said Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment have become the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with a lack of labour.
In the Czech Republic, graduates in construction are missing and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by a pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"The construction authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But real visions are missing, says ČRO – myRozhlas commentator
Beyond the classical celebrations, politicians' speeches have traditionally accompanied the entry into the new year.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and ANO President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As a thesis, I find my thesis great right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's, I always work on it for a year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
Stationery is completely at peace with us, unless you are a total macaque and something is left in your head, so the board won't stifle you unnecessarily on a theory.
For example, I studied for a week for my stationery and when I was at a loss, the board always tried to lead me on some logical inference, which came right to me and I got it right.
Anyway, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's an exam that reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
Don't flood your emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along because otherwise, something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie-the-Pooh.
You need to put it in such a way that it touches Xi Jinping's butt or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws a wrench at artists.
Once you don't give stories every day, and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to a bare minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which feature is more important, like, comment, or save.
It's really pissing me off lately, so I might have to stoop to tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my line of work have been successful and almost won't let it happen.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly to come along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Workers' Party on Donbas
The Union - yes, breaking up - no, the opponents of breaking up the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the unlawful breaking up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Belarusian Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open leniency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With the stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early nineties, the population of Russia has declined by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the White Forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, put the brakes on agriculture, tore away from the world's greatest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "the vacuum of strength."
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I won't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I'll wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit about how if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed bad, rotten or poor is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to see Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I had a hunch that it would be some kind of agita.
After reading it I found who published it and eventually it came out Scientology.
Well, it was good stuff, full of completely useless lectures, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
A waste of paper, for this the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail make you want to accommodate that person because you like them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times for going out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and begged me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started getting fucked.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and keep her from running amok again.
A person like that sucks your feelings, your emotions and your overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When there are insurance companies crawling around furiously buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator have been placed under five days of house arrest.
In the West, they've stopped the shenanigans and accepted that there's no point in solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has yet to steal something and drive his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we're getting some good old-fashioned junk back.
After a few years of decline and suppression of this nefarious business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman in college), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "don't worry about it, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offered because I wanted to help people, however, the training was more about how to scare and talk a person down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to swing a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made you feel like a pot peddler.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, you learned not to jump on every fad and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't experienced many of these things in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own business and don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluations happen somehow, in the form that we do it quite well (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what came out and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you on some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes you feel like we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation well.
But it works that way they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
A Czech woman reported missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Jakub Kulhánek, the minister of foreign affairs in resignation, announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradišť had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police confirmed this afternoon to our embassy in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose any more information about the case.
Our condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work, before boarding to collect money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, London police began searching for her, with Interpol listing her as a missing person around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police had already arrested a man in this connection several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what they suspect him of, but they have not disclosed.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice na Mostecku, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná na Pelhřimovsku.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils fell apart.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections for the councils in these four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a relatively challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, the highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major hitches.
To come to terms with how idiotic a large part of the population at all levels is, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and of his ability to regain it.
The chances of that actually happening, however, as others here mention, are very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure shredding a file would even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Increasing number of people under 35 who go a year without sex
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, the DailyMail website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of these may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less a priority for young people, may have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among people in marriage, with only 5% saying they have not had sex in the last year as of 2021.
For single people, the figure was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that they are a minority among unmarried individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says of the 30%.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic, are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without a job or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown period of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandating covid vaccination is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e. the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some disinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we are responsible for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves. ________________________________________________________________________________
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about religious people.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to a boathouse so that we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked down one of these pretty wide streets, and who do we not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell all over us.
Luckily, I escaped, but she and a friend got talking.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We are very spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must collectively make it clear that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, should be solved, according to the Chancellor, using diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group," comprising France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially triggered the migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegally).
He has discussed with the chancellor further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured DPA that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunk Polish nun responsible for accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was being driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When the cops told her that she could still lose her license for not giving her the right of way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had hit the vehicle and asked her for help.
The cops then came for Sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her license after they found out that she had a blood level of over two milligrams.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing his best.
But Juraj Sajmovič did not guard his film.
Czech family comedy makers have seen themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But they have forgotten the essential thing: the laws of the cinematic craft.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, another film called Here We Guard is now courting the audience's emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person, Juraj Sajmovič Jr., loosely builds on his previous film, Here I Guard, from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava that is dying, start inviting dog-walkers to it, Julie's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Sajmovic (who is also a producer of the film) struggled with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative pair wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or the church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the woods, who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken away from the hospital so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog can take place in the heart of Šumava's solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog-walker competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving on tip-off in search of “drugs” and discussing over herbs the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the boarding house, of course, gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and immediately sits with her hair waxed and makeup on a cigar at the family table demanding her father's whiskey and floss as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that “this sometimes happens after a coma.”
Šajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to build bearing situations, feeling for the characters' characters as well as the punchline and direction.
The performances are uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression muddy.
However much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to endure their parties, they have little to play.
The only positive feature of the film remains the poetic footage of Šumava's nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch several characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar terms the characters commit.
The argument is not even the age-old membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Knowledge of craft must be behind good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man and dog if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canisteraphy this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listen to this shit all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The almost total absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual,” the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore more of an exception.
It is good for us.
It has not rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively during the winter months, and is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just forests, but also supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater resource, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have warned of drought for a long time.
"It is to be expected that precipitation may decrease here, depending on global warming and climate change," Israeli Water Management Authority spokesperson Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
Tank trucks are increasing on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker truck driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the talks in Vienna had brought "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz said he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had brought "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I used to pry the lady a little and grill her during an interview to find out what she wanted me to do.
Eventually I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I gave the lady a few more moments of doubt and questions and finally thanked her and left.
You can call me a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiers this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at ski lifts.
While ski lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country tracks and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Area Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the resort in Branna in Šumpersko were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, praised the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Procházka.
The operators of the ski resorts can sell the ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from the covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some ski rental shops and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in ski rental.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
She expects a greater surge during the ski course period.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in ski equipment rentals as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost rented.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people got lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, there is a great demand for ski rentals at the Novako resort on Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must order them in advance now.
"We are starting renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect great interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the resort.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school, she says.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a good life here, as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people go abroad who have no assets here.
The owner of a company really doesn't just go abroad.
But the rest I totally agree with.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people don't have the vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started so that one fine day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It's naive to think that the Czech Republic can't find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is elections at all.
If living here is bad, some traditional V4 lunatic can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, leaving his supporters and people whose assets can't be put on a plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand, the crew of The Island, headed by Jiri Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last reportedly seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, was a "nurse's assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, a children's hospital affiliated with Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," a group of health institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srncová during a press conference on Saturday, is also calling for public cooperation.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service," said Harman.
Police had earlier arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
These are not "huge numbers" but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we exaggerate the threat of Invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what you deduced that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons with the situation in '38 are off on so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it is not going to honour the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That's about it and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in effect in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are awaiting several changes starting on Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, the fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will start running through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
In the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station, the fast train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will newly stop.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslavsko will be included, including lines extending to the Liberec and Královéhradecký Regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and the operation will be adjusted to 12 functioning ones.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague Zličín, which will go as far as Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened during the morning peak and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will newly start.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They start from the Střížkov metro station, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné in Podještědí.
Conversely, the operation on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines is newly cancelled or limited, including to Mochova, Dobříš or Rozmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes are also awaiting passengers at other places.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
Lines 540 to 543 on Nymburk have been changed and some bus routes on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region are being modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30 minutes and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy only pizza buns and yogurt and apple for snack.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you, unfortunately, that's the way it is.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but revelations about the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she kept the love from them for six months.
"I dare say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But she says he picked her up, not the other way around.
They have been the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, continues the singer.
I just don't know who is worse off.
Whether those who are not interested at all and are jumping out of the can, or we, whose lives they are thoroughly dissecting.
As if any of you would like to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are suited to each other, or insist that everyone really know the list of your ex-partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was visiting to prepare her new fashion line.
Nedvěd has been a long-term vice-president of Juventus Football Club.
They've come clean now, waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife, Ivana, have been separated for three years, but they haven't been married on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and are happy for us, thank you.
We're just people, too, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think our hearts are in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him by me, I'm by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hello, the other commentators have probably already said all the essentials, I'm just confirming that colleges are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems like the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Flats are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francie etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the neighborhood of Veveří is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it's fine, besides it's close to most of the BUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you're going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can teach what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or they can go according to the state and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he throws in a few crowns on a full state contribution and thanks to that he can teach what he wants in the schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, made such comments about a petition for boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is for you the same as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloguing/digitalisation that (even long-time professionals) either throw it out of the way, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it altogether.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on which program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look up the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer has simply created his own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it more like the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than the Odrynian?
PSS: someone's already cracked this for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't even know what the 'subject' of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood a text is laughable.
All the important documents approved are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English isn't enough for that anyway, that's a matter for the lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in the various EU institutions, English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus with the English it's quite interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hate in Ceylon.
I've been working there for three years and it's totally fine.
I drive home from work at 10 p.m. and never have any problems.
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is obstruct the pavement and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of flats are there now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without both Dada and mistress Gelem like a stake in a fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slovacek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
Dada wreath I saw and Lucie must have one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras' words that he visits her often.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met Anna, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelem: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time and I'm sure to buy Dada and Lucie something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video launch at Club Richman.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývlt.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
The cops are few and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are not at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes on the head of previous governments, not the army, they have been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and there is less rainfall in places where there has been no shortage of water.
The drought that is occurring in a large part of Central Europe is caused by climate change.
But the impact is amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also a total gimmick.
And whether you're a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's compared.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators what they point out, what the referees notice they don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And even if it was the other way around it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Outbreak in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily outbreaks.
5766 people are hospitalised.
A total of 34 451 people have died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days are at 100,000 in the Czech Republic in 1967, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of outbreaks in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29 929 new outbreaks have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered outbreaks in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of outbreaks, caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor for the British Health Security Authority, said on TV on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalised in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after the outbreak, and deaths about three weeks after the outbreak.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A Johnson government minister defended the quiz being "virtual," over a computer.
But groups of staff gathered around computers were attending it in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
They will be elections of pan-European significance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from this, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one so far is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is markedly different.
Before, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
This is a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to the independent media, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the indications of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time I was 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it hits extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time I'm very choleric and I was angry as a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, they took me to the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me educatively, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by violence now, as a little girl I used to fight quite a bit, now I hit something for discharging myself, and as a younger girl I slapped my parents hand maybe (not to get too much slapped), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my children and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, hopefully every parent just screws up something, it's probably impossible not to screw up their kids a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why an OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call cunts those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise I wonder if you're afraid of an income shortfall?
Can you really count on people wanting the product and buying it and you'll have something to pay the mortgage with?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but it also revealed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the leaders of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How crucial will the trial be for Slovakia?
The journalists are enormously to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition by the deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and society got hurt.
On Czech TV, they were dying with covid just six months ago.
Another government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository is nowhere to be found
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs a fundamental overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and authorisation of a deep-sea repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep-sea Repository, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect from the law a significant strengthening of their possibilities in the decision-making of the repository, as has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposal of the law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticised by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given site.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before launching a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal for a substantive intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for the municipalities for the whole process of locating and selecting the site for the repository, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a site for the repository.
Only in certain permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or the minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit decides.
Possible legal action does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploratory or construction works.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform asks for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting a repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works is supposed to be almost 4 million crowns, according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against deep repository said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for deep repository of high-level radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of the municipalities for such a crucial building similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform against deep repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories.
The Platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for potential storage be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: he lost 200 pounds.
Although he didn't feel the need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he was eventually scared by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 200 pounds, which is half his original weight of 180 pounds, reports The Sun.
He flaunted his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and perhaps a college text, I'd probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like a lord / ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who don't need to be beaten at all in order to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't directly confront them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
Then there are mini bosses.
It's not possible to translate the boss in a one-word word word kind of way, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (interesting is maybe only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It's simply significant for a story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
Czech police are also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been wanted since 7 December.
She is also helping British police through Interpol.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular about her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"Czech police are working closely with British police," said police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra has already been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She should be from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The MP Harriet Harman has also been involved in the search for Petra.
She has been involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face on them.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who he is or what he had to do with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month's attacks significantly intensified as the end of the year approached.
A large campaign related to Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
An infected attachment in an email is supposed to attract the attention of the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt repairs for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and September, and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
The spyware Formbook also remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but remains behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have seen a significant decrease and dampening of activity with the Fareit program, which was behind 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
Today's demo of smarts who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reports.
According to the footage of the parade along the embankment and in my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population has led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-gypsyists and associates alone couldn't fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are on the rise in popularity, reminding me of A Million Moments for an Inside-Out Democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose or more-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it's obvious that we'll have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, of which mankind is rightly proud.
End of Stalemate, Bulgaria Has a New Prime Minister Announcing Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change to form a new government, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has lasted since April, when the last government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
The 'covertly' footage has become a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to police, her previous employer or an MP representing the part of London where she lived is calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
'Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her,' Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video posted on Saturday.
'Her family in the Czech Republic are very worried about her too and just want to know where she is,' she continued.
The missing Czech woman is reported to have left work around 7.45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last reported missing on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, was a nursing assistant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, a children's hospital affiliated with Guy's and St Thomas'.
“We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the group of health institutions said in a Twitter post.
“We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Šumperská amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a pirate county councillor) was reported anonymously for violating copyright by her paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of Krteček in Šumperské rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover was gaping for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The municipality referred complaints to the RMD, which owns the road, and because it did not react, the hole gaped on.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "intensively solve the situation".
