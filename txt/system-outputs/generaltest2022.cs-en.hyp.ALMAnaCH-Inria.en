There is a great return to the Czech Resolution.
Paul Francis was professed to NHL
The Czech ice hockey guard Pavel Franciz, who passes through his career in recent months, returns back to the NHL.
The one-year-old Pilsen family will be on the skier and soon it could reach the gate.
Former guard Lytvínová, Pilsen or Czech Republic injured in preparation for the NHL this October.
Just in the middle of the match with Vegas, he has not been represented at the NHL glides since then.
The incident occurred when an experienced guard moved from one rod to another.
"Pavel Francis will be outside about three to four weeks with injuries at the bottom of the body," said Denver at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL gate lasted for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was professed from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AGL, 94.5% of the procedures were added.
The Pilsen Hockey League wants to finally accommodate and confirm that it belongs to the world’s best league.
In the last year he had problems with cycling and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch the only match.
In the NHL "Francek" took 36 matches, its success is 92.3%.
Charles deploys Camille empire, William and Kate in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
His wishes were also published by Prince Charles, who used a photo on which his cabinet Camille helps to deploy a knight.
The British BBC news station was informed on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, collaborators and foundations they cooperate with.
The photo was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duke of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and dresses also have Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, has as well as Prince George and Louis shorts and t-shirt with collar.
Who has taken the photo, William and Kate have not reported, it is not clear when exactly created.
Last year, the royal family for photography designed as a Christmas wish invited a package of straws before the accumulation of wood in its countryside seat in Norfolk County.
The image that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by the successor to the throne of Prince Charles with his wife Camilly.
Photographer himself Hussein captured them in June at the reaches of Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on the head and on the face of the empire, helps Camille deploy her empty color matching with light dresses.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbrový million for a title, Tvrdik denied it.
Prague – Crimeans in the current corruption caucus allegedly worked with the accusation of former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns for a league title in 2018/19 season from Prague Slavia.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he got to part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the Urshow club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that no corruption negotiations were red.
The server published a transcription of police hearings in which Slavia is mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer in the master club.
The former influential functionary of the Red Whites was, according to the writer, in frequent contact with both Berbre and former sports director Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
The criminals allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbrova promised a financial reward for receiving a title.
2019 won the SK Slavia Prague title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) of the SK Slavia Prague functionalists had a million fees for winning the league, quoted the server from the list.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of Slavia Tvrdik.
There is no longer anything from the list, according to the server, whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He rejected the claim of any corruption.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the attitudes in Czech football and offered an opposite alternative to its development.
We have never initiated illegal negotiations, did not seek to influence arbitrators in contradiction with fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial performance in this context," said Tvrdik for the List of Reports.
In posts, among other things, Nezmar is not choosing to insult some former players of Slavia dark skin, as well as the prayer of his former Tvrdik's chef.
In mid-October, Kauza allegedly influenced the matches through the arbitrators, the police intervention in several locations, including the Prague FACR.
The highest position in the affair is Berbr, which no longerfigures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as well as former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle worse (the shooter must be made of a pancerated cabin and carry the charges manually without covering).
Cars - Toyoti hi-lux - are new and good
Loaders and various pancer vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - small and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I'm gonna beside the city.
From the river climbed nutrition and damaged crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that on the second bank of the river there was a fisherman.
I didn't want to make bordles, so I sat in peace and probably didn't notice the tip.
I hoped that he would leave before something was going out, but of course in a moment the fragment went.
I let her come for 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman sprinkled, had heads on all sides, so I called on him that it was on a frage.
Before I tear out of the possession was a fuch.
I mean, I like a man to be a pigtail.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would have to be played a lot of accidents to become something, probably you would be seen in the thermal vision that has almost everyone today.
So in a visible place, expensive things to put your feet in the sleeping and you should be cool.
Vojtach versus Hamaček.
Inside the respirators found significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of reefs, masks and respirators for the professions of the nearest coronavirus has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks.
The iRozglas server compared the purchases of individual ministers and found that within one day the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices so dramatic?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why others bought the road?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of iRozglas Dominika Kubištová server.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (probably I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which were made by the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military.
We do not even have large warehouses of techniques that could be captured, we do not actually have modern technique or for existing professionals, in addition, modern technique is still more complex, so the ability of the founders will quickly lose in time.
To do this, modern conventional conflicts, where someone can deploy, will take place very quickly, will not be the time to exercise someone again.
Finally, founding/territorial defence is of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead the mass heril and it is also expressed the need to regret the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will only be conducted in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the heroes will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
mainly, we do not have individual skills.
This is not even the worst.
The worst is that the half of them plays like if they had it.
This will then happen to a situation that you look like a fraer who didn't crash the empty gate back 2 minutes, go into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and say "tvl and what are you probably thinking to happen now?".
Well, of course, will elect him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this ability to "behave a defender" is so terrible that I am surprised sincerely when I see that our attacker could play one opponent.
First arrangement
Covid's pandemic slows down, but experts don't expect a major return for the next weeks.
The pressure in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time, and the pandemic equation was added, as well as known, to the new unknown: the variant of omicrons, which is very likely to spread faster than currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet absolutely sure to say whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or poststinphic immunity can help against it obtained prior to the disease.
However, this week the unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, antivirotic molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by a paxlovid medicine from Pfizer, which is even 85 per cent of the results.
However, the first supplies of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in combating the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the administration is ready for incoming drugs.
As it was said, first of all, Merck's molnupiravir will be available to domestic patients.
The company ended on the tape as the first, even because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic was launched to find suitable treatment for viral horse diseases in the South American continent.
For this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often concerned.
They are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and in particular Czechs, are accustomed to speaking "how we have grown up".
See a research where people ask whether they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will say that they are not.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we are Czech racist beasts.
And then go and choose the parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancelling culture, saying this in the public means losing work and media link.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the West is good, the east is poor.
But find out what people think.
It is only in France Le Pen and Zemmir, both have more than 20% according to the survey.
Even we know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the rotation of units so that soldiers do not have to learn where they are, all objects are the same.
Of one, Atom Brda Museum and the remaining two are abandoned.
Sranda is that sssr did not have a nuclear head on its own territory, whether for safety or speed of deployment of heads because of a more Western position.
In those underground covers (in each picture there are two) only the heads were kept not the whole missile as they say.
If it was necessary to install this weapon, a special unit was arrived, which picked up this head and mounted on some bearing devices.
In addition to the museum painting, they are left in a desolated state.
At the second stage of primary school, we had a Gypsy colleague, 4 years we were with him.
It was quite fine, he did good fun, often too much manifested, but it was such our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, often walked and wanted to explain something, lacked little, walked regularly, sports worked with us, did not steal snacks, neither phones, walked purely garmented.
He went to schools in nature, made different opponents, but was cool, perhaps never a gap.
In the eighth or ninth class, they entered the same year, other classes.
Shortly, the teacher left, solved something by police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have already sold to Gypsies, the money has always been, they didn't try to attract me to the price, communication in peace.
I even sold this car as well, the boy in a month called that it was already overwritten..
I say about myself that I am not racial, I am one if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, until it behaves as in a decent society (works, works, women of heaven, just normal behavior).
But as somebody comes, pulls his hand, washs out the apartments and houses, has only an inconvenience around him, makes problems... so it's one that has a color, but it's worth me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they are involved, start businessing, working, learning language (not necessary, at least English), respecting our culture.
If I believe in Allah, it is one thing to me until I respect my tradition and culture, I will also be there.
Young woman died in the accident of cars in Prachatice
"Youth woman suffered serious numerous injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she was injured on the site," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for Southern Healthcare.
The accident probably failed the driver who took the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle is likely to move from the village of Žichovec to the village of Bavorov and, for undiscovered reasons, went to the opposite direction.
After the collapse, Škoda Octavia ended with the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the road, described the accident spokesperson for South Bohemian police Stephen Schwarz.
The young Peugotu driver suffered very serious injuries.
It was numerous injuries and remained spelled in the car.
After dismissal, she had to be provided with acute pre-Democracy care and in a stable state he was transported to the Czech Budapest Hospital, according to Fajtlová’s rescue officer.
She added that a man from the second car suffered lighter injuries to the chest and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not supply data
Lukáš Neuheisl orders abroad several times a month.
He organizes mainly collector cards.
“Usually it can be dozens of dollars, we’ll tell you, from ten dollars, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where it’s often free of charge,” the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small shipments has been slightly irritated, new VAT must be added and mailed to customs proceedings.
He will receive an email with the message that customs expect the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the shipment data, and if VAT has not included a merchant in the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide customs proceedings alone, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the entire process is not complicated.
I call one or two check boxes, I insert two attachments and I'm ready.
For me it is mostly a five-minute question, says Neugeisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rule, the daily number of shipments received from abroad declined to the international post in Prague from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for the delivery of data that are necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments to be processed on international mail.
If people complete all the data they need and fill them in time, so we would be about half here, says the spokesperson for the Czech Post Matiaš Vítik.
Inflation solutions
See the subtitle, how would you suggest solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% of inflation and are expected to grow further.
What should the state do, according to you, to slow or compensate for this growth?
Do we see a reduction in VAT for food and PHM in Poland, is this way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it sleeps?
Prices grow faster than they pay, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, mainly energy.
How many you have received, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year I was added to 2% in gross, which is laughing, but fortunately I have a similar income from businesses that operate at work.
Would someone be able to explain why provenly convinced violents send themselves behind the grid for only 6 months?
This head simply does not know how the court can only send for 6 months such animal behind the grid only to do it again as it comes out.
6 The month is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relations in general.
And this does not mention that the victim of rape may never be remembered.
Doesn't this disagree with the potential future reports of rape to the victim?
A man from Grobe "burned" his girlfriend from Costomlat
A man from Groba unwillingly helped the guardians to ensure his national search for a girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was ordered to arrest.
He himself called them to her.
He went to the calls.
He first appealed to the surrounding and thought that he was stolen.
After calling to the emergency line, the guardians arrived at the place and were not enough to see when they allegedly said that they all thought that guards would arrive at the place.
In fact, he wanted to advise guardians on how to submit notifications to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the guardians found that the woman was on the list of searched persons, in a national search, and arrest order was issued.
The case therefore deals with the CDM.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that we are not ethnically or culturally speaking for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with me that the damage that Churchill was not able to ensure the liberation of the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
But I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without proof just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case personally as a right faith.
Here I can't agree with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world if I don't weave something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in some of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will irreparably punish you if you believe in another god.
However, it is in the tenth that there is no god other than Jahveh.
Therefore, it would not be more rational to refrain from faith in any god than risking that of the thousands of gods to choose wrong and that one real god I did not treat, will send me to hell or to a similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X-months of training (in different specializations, X-months per one) and under the leadership of professions with practical experience.
If a person knows well, he can get a professional offer.
All ingredients of the Czech Republic would fit something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say as follows: The cooperation between the educational sector and industry has continued to be mistaken, the company hunts at schools and takes place some delay when the labour force migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only adolescents, but this process is constantly taking place, each of us constantly learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar penetration should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, German or, for example, Mongolian rider will never proceed here.
It will come funny to me, as you consider NATO to be something pulled out into the stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if there is a gap.
But you'll delight the panba.
Just one election in the United States that will cry out their budget and the whole NATO goes to learning.
The English exchanges us for Russian dust, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Police once turned out to show them back and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence is armed army after the teeth and the population who can control the military equipment of their time.
And today they can pilot remote control of the means of each teenager so that it would not happen.
We don't need border fortification, this is today to come, but hang the teenager behind the remote controlled device.
How not to drown in box tsunami
Do you wrap gifts under a Christmas tree and at once you are filled with boxes and fillings at home?
This "waste" re-uses e-shops that miss packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops was created, which your boxes used welcome.
And not only about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, the damage to them is treated as a disposable waste.
Anyone can, upon agreement, bring to the interconnected trade (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and avoid overfilled blue containers.
Shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently insufficient in the market and also saved money, as the packaging cardboard has irritated by 50% over the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, they strengthen their brand.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, the manufacturer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling materials to us in Popovek near Brno by individuals who collect at home are also asked to us by companies with which we have agreed regularly shifted cardboards.
We use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more comprehensive world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature with other generations, says Petra Lopushnikova from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only shopping places for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (when to deduct sorted waste from the household, where to deduct passed medications, tyres, supplied electrics, batteries, light sources, large waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, in addition, reuseable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project contains over 100,000 such places.
"Successfully, collective courts, reuse centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste," Miroslav Kubasek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklidme Czech Association, adds.
Speak me badly that today technology is so simple and fluffy that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or actually mobile phones simply hide the underlying file system with folders and all uploads to one screen in the app.
Quietly, let’s use technology from childhood, but especially let’s learn something.
Let's write history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they should not be prosecuted in a half year.
However, French politicians like it and like voters.
Macron supporters of the intersection between the right and the left match little, but just Europe yes.
And in France, new elections will be the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, inter alia, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed to the criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and translates history.
In fact, this is trying to defend rewritten history rather.
The extremely right-wing candidate for French President Eric Zemmir is now circumventing France with the fact that the regime of Vichy, who collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad and has quite a success with the French.
Try to take Macron's idea of one textbook of history seriously and regardless of the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story to me versus them and never as a story in general.
Spanish, French, Czechs learn who defeated in which battle.
But if they do not have an illuminated cantor, they will no longer know what was the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mouses" did not win.
The story that returns to the Massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 was also awarded awards for directors and for the best actress Jasn Duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held the first stages of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the Father's film.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was approx. like "wash the influenza/be captured" A few days I had diarrhea and had no taste to smoke...
This was worse than the normal flu.
I have no diarrhoea in the influenza.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim to have it all)
Christmas book types
The Christmas double number, which will be released on December 20, will contain a traditional literary attachment.
And along with it, cultural tips will go.
In addition to this digital edition, the books are available to you, subscribers, so that you may have enough time to get books like Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that follow the previous similar collection of Petriček Sellier & Petriček Bellot.
Another portion of world observation and description of everyday things with unusual poetry notice, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
Telling about the return to the roots, which will only be drawn illusion.
Bohemian and comparatist transmits the fairy tale about the Red Cartoon to the balloons of the current village.
Its feeding of brutality exceeds the folk version and grades in the horror of emotional empty.
And that the way back to instincts is shorter than a person is willing to admit
The author in his last novel tells about a rather less sentimental story of returning from emigration than we were able to listen to.
Those who remained, and those who left, know too little about themselves to give it to a common life.
Trains begin to ride according to a new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday, trains start to the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some tracks, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet begins to ride instead of the Czech roads.
For most lines only modify the departure time, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the colleges.
The carriers started selling tickets in autumn.
Czech railways plan to tell on average 6783 passenger transport connections daily on average of 478 remote trains.
The train runs around 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
The roads alongside national connections under the new schedule will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, has dozens of new trains.
The main news will be Interet trains that will ride on lines from Prague to Cheba.
Another new train carrier will explore in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the price of the ticket from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
The roads take into account inflation into their tariffs every year.
The largest change in RegioJet’s timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Melník – Nimburk – Kolín.
After success in the competition, the Ministry of Transport will replace the Czech Railways.
Daily RegioJet will tell a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped in the stations of Havličkov Brod, Ždar nad Sazavou and Cologne since Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two backbone connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the speaker Emil Selarik, the carrier tried to preserve the most similar time of travel of his remote trains despite the planned extraction work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier is also replaced in some regional routes.
The changes are waiting for passengers to Czechoslovakia, for example, where trails from Mladá Boleslav through the Czech Lipa to Rumburk will ride instead of the Czech trails Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use uniform railway tickets for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price increases by 3.2% inflation.
I have to disagree.
Perhaps we will not learn the view of the other side?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were pushed and had to drill, died.
In my life I have not heard teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
Nobody will tell you in schools that blacks were often sold to slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
Nobody teaches you that colonizers often bought soil from Indians everywhere, just tell you how brutal we, Europeans, murdered them, while murdered long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in Southern.
I did not encounter that someone would deliberately silence the facts, but I heard earlier that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (especially in Japan there are atrocities from WW2 quite a taboo).
My point was rather that history was not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in some sensations, it's just what is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, when we are already with those Southern states, yes, confederation flag and famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they had some good success and came to me absurdly to put them down.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as it is currently idealizing enough people.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves and enough things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, deliberately leave some facts, lies and manipulate them, in addition, our perspective doesn't exist (it was also a video from TV where someone started talking about our legionarians and 1968).
What came to me at US schools funny was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never survived their land.
Overall, it came to me that at some universities it was scarce, those students were quite happy and those schools supported them once.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older once, I am a little evil of the fact that this could be the voice of most of them because they are among young people and in the ruler elite.
It comes to me that, for example, feminism has long achieved what he had and it is not about the same, he has been treated.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization on the other hand, often leading to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical is someone, the more to hear it.
Anyway at the end, I also did not meet that someone would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I've met a bad geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I wouldn't like it here, but because I think it's absolutely unprecedented.
Should I be proud of something I could not alone?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If something with people takes me such interests, views of the world and common experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not faithful, but of what I know, I can say this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes there, one is Ukraine and the other Slovakia.
The Slovak farmer is a terrible faithful guy, has a doubt rather about theology than about politics, but then always a coconut about the coronavirus that everyone is stuck.
Then there is of course the Church of Czechoslovak Hussite.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to the services of the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but members are mostly liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functional temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominican Square and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do the mess in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Betlem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Breclav – The flame bent in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts were not in Vienna due to the pandemic of the coronavirus, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing of Reintal – Breclav.
Last year they took it on the border.
The Bethlehemian light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate annually with the section, I look forward to it.
It is the honour for me that I was chosen, told the present journalists of the scout Amalia Budiková.
While last year the transfer took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal – Breclav at the parking lot.
Usually for him, the scouts ride by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes to the delivery of flame in the Czech Republic.
With the betlemic light, the scouts traditionally trained to Brno, where they passed it to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlém.
On Saturday, December 18, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, which will travel by selected quick and personal trains.
They will take light in the stations of local scouts or volunteers, who will then spread the flame to the Czech Republic and where the rails do not know.
Even this year, scouts must comply with valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It happens like last year.
We recommend both courier teams and organizers of local events to, of course, carry the knights, try to follow the steps, it was as little as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, she described the spokesperson for the betlemic light event Zuzana Hrbkova.
The betlemic light tradition, which travels to Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread at the same time with the flame of the idea of room, friendship and peace.
The Bethlehemian light is for believers a symbol of hope, the light that exceeds darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been taking care of in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event is worth hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of ignorance and human mutuality.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the foundations of the economy that confirm that subsidies to cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education makes proper use of the money, and I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned - the unnecessary product is produced and it gains the free market and “natural life of the company”.
I am working in a factory where million signs are “xy financed/co-financed by the xi project” on the hallway, and such a company is simply artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs x people, this is the earlier development when this company holds and takes off contracts/employees to companies that could grow up and be more productive after its disappearance
Complete consent, it is terrible.
Sometimes even the person who was born at the Internet time is also caught into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think Internet advertising with me is neglected, but then I'm just likewise catching out that I've been affected by it - it's just so so smashed that a person will not always defend it.
For this reason, I support radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to completely prohibit programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all the leadership, words classic - I would prohibit the Internet.
I feel of this faith has roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe anything that most believes and makes sense, I'm not sheep, but I'm more happy to believe anything that is less likely, does not give it too much meaning, but it's important that I'll have my own original opinion about which I'll claim it's a critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything they say to the media"
3. "non-believable policy"
TVs missed the trend of Christmas films, their premiere are two hundred this year
Los Angeles – Cinema, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen down the trend of Christmas films and this year their audiences will present a record of more than two hundred.
It consisted of the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years in the public points out and significantly increases tracking, so these images are increasingly created.
This year, four times more Christmas films than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have Christmas (Vacation) in their name, so really there will be much more festive films.
Films that people traditionally connect with Christmas always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales with this period, worldwide images of the Sami at home, Love of Heaven or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful since 1946.
But the right boom of Christmas images started until 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special film series, he reminded the BBC server.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Counting to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to fit its viewers at Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
Competitive Lifetime station has 35 new Christmas films this year and a total of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story is not so important, it is important that there are plenty of Christmas trees in the background and that snows," said Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be at home on Christmas movies).
“For the audience, this is the form of leakage and the way to feel a little calm in the middle of all the festive madness and madness of the world in which we have lived in the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that will be solved successfully and the two will kiss.
This is still around, and as long as all movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, complement Gray.

Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, with security being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," said her representatives for formula1.com.
The Gaas replacement rider will not send, nor can he send.
An alternative would have to complete a qualification or driving in another part of the weekend.
With covid-19, the first racer is not affected.
At the start of the final season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year he was positively tested by Sergio Perez No. Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
He is a little like portable jewelry and the creator puts in him half a year of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home the sweaters never carried too much," says Lebanon, who spent over his work 3000 hours over half a year.
Silkly bought in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has another hook.
"I'm completely on the other hand, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," says Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, was “only” CZK 720 000.

Omikron mutations spread in southern Moravia?
Hygiene checks another case of the child from Adam.
“We have actually reported additional suspicions of this option for another child from Adam from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not demonstrated,” said Cyupek.
In the week there were six cases in the region.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of variants in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the Director.
She added that it is two nurses from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adam School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adam.
Three of them have, according to the Director, slight symptoms, four unsymptoms.
Nobody suspected of Omikron travelling abroad
None of these traveled abroad, nor none of their families, nor contacted anyone who would stay abroad.
The relationship with the waterfield championship is not in any of the above mentioned, said Cyupek.
The main hygiene Pavla Svrčínová previously stated that an international tournament in the water field was checked in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa and one Belgian player after returning.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to proceed as Texas when you ban abortions.
On Saturday, Guverner California Havin News announced the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous US state through the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of embryo heart rate.
People should then be entitled to compensation in the action of anyone who produces or sells attack guns and firearms in California.
Newsoma reacted to the Friday opinion of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texai ban on abortions in force, to be against almost 50 years of an old precedent verdict, which provided for the right to abortion on a surface throughout the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has not now decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical question that arises from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the prohibition was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack its usual trip.
“I am encouraged by the Supreme Court of the United States (February) decision yesterday, which allowed the preservation of the Texa ban of most food services and to a large extent supported the manoeuvre of Texas to protect its law,” said the California Governor.
“If the states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” News continues.
He, in collaboration with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice, mandated him to work on measures that would justify the public representative to enforce the prohibition of attacking guns and so-called weapons of spirit.
This is marked by a weapon that does not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
News wants to have “private citizens” the right to require compensation of at least $100,000 (over CZK 200,000) and court excuses from anyone who would virabel, distribute or sell attack guns, components of “arms of spirits” or sets for their production in California.
“If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons outside our streets, creating a threat to private actions, then we should do so exactly,” said the California Governor.
The AP Agency believes that California has forbidden the production and sale of some weapons of army style for decades, but in June the Federal Judge blocked the ban as constitutional.
The words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in the disagreement with the opinion on the Friday majority verdict, warned before the enlargement of that legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed if the state actually renewed by the Texas template.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognize full immunity against the judicial review and allowed food clinics to continue complaints against selected US officials.
Each emergency vaccination has its public test phase, when it gradually comes to how the vaccination scheme will look like and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already in a large roll.
And according to these studies, up to five times increases in antibodies in most patients, which has already mentioned long-term effect.
Just like every other vaccination will have its vaccination scheme for time, only soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should not enter the market, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Zibra, the European Commission would act in contravention of law if it exercised new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, would stop the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already suspended the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the Union fund to restore the economies affected by covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the principles of the law.
“Poland should respond to this EU vision in all matters requiring unanimity,” said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarity Poland, without whose vote the current government would come closely to the majority of the Seyma.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policies that lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be just because the EU unlawfully rejects us from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister.
His party's approach to the EU takes more radical attitudes than the ruler's Party of Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes in Polish justice for Ziobr's action threaten its independence and undermine politicians.
According to Zibrá, Brussels states "impossible conditions because its goal is not a state of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces “the political dictatorship carried out by visions and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles”, Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of a EU based on a partnership between sovereign states and not on the governments of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions of Brussels, which would result in a limited sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree to have Poland's status as colony,” he said.
But to recognize in this... We have one kind of cheese in four different places in Lila.
I didn't look for other things, one yogurt met too many times, I needed only cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I cut off and asked.

If cursed, I don't even do any market, actions don't do anything, gold the edges on the square, there need not have such a choice, but most have everything I need and has some advice, so I have a ten-minute finished.

Two years I follow how data is treated here as a fertilizer, most vaccination resistors are just a little more out of the bowl than most vaccinations.

My childhood was punished by hobbies.
It was never because of stamps, most were just that I refused to hear and mislead (read instead of going to sleep, came with the bags, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without notice, my mother always threatened that if I do it once again, I will get the wound (sometimes even after another "start" hob only brought and laid it so that I can see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable implementation and measure) are beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
It is important, according to me, that part of the warning because it gives the child its way to choose whether he will not hear and get, or will improve and the punishment will not.
Finally, I had only a warning to hear.
Selected system
When the important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtach Cepl answered the journalistic question, what the Czech Constitution meant for him – whether the sacred list, which she swears about, and which she reluctantly learned at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely adhered to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and to better save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
As the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he voted the question of Vojtach Cepl.
However, recently, there is increasingly an opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to change.
Summer is tested by situations that her creators (which Vojtach Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, the Ceple had the truth.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be a key to tackling most of the crisis that companies meet across the history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a number of government regulations consisting of individual rules laying down the politicians of mantinels of the game.
We are afraid that much will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno I fight for the life of a monthly baby
Despite the fact that the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also difficult cases with which the hospitals are faced mainly recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected by less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, Primary Clinic of Children’s Anesthesiology and Resuscitation, Faculty of Medicine and Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children's patients who are severe with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need slight support care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Indeed, very severe children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were at the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"There is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means lung inflammation, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease interferes in addition to adults, both adolescents and several months' baby.
In hospitals, children are also in difficult condition due to coronavirus.
"Now we have a child of several months of adolescent age," said the primarily.
However, it is pleasant that no child deaths have yet been recorded at the children's hospital of FN Brno.
According to available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only at the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the collaboration of the psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“We recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone you can walk only on the marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not so large.
You can see on map.
Generally in national parks outside the peaceful zone you can walk anywhere (but not through the fence to the field).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside the marked path must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so looking outside national parks).
How does the conductor exercise?
Music goes in my head, laughing Josef Kurfirt.
He played the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing almost all the repertoire and act as conductor not only in the Liberec Theatre of F. Šalda, but also in Pilsen, at Josef Kajetan Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with Hradec Philharmonic, film phillharmonic or sub-Christmas symphonic orchestra.
China builds the impression of controlled infections and that authoritarian regime faces the crisis better
Synologist Jiříš: China is building the impression of controlled infections and that the authoritarian regime faces the crisis better.
China went to medical and political offenses.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected the criticism that he did not manage to stop the infection that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the earth says a zero increase of the infected.
States, including the Czech opponents on Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors, have helped many in combating coronavirus, for example, at the top of Italy.
How to perceive the hunting of Beijing?
Is it a friendly support or a communist regime is trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and tells him: gel don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The husband is happy because the salvation of grass, the car washs with a boot, the children play with him.
But a simple parade.
If you want to sell the elephant for 5000.
Camera: so yeah, yeah, it's gonna be a parade...
After some time they meet and what he bought complains: what are the will you sold for elephants????
The lawn breaks, everywhere the giant branch, the car settled, the children are afraid of him, and the wife wants to let him divorce.
Those who have sold said, Immortally speak of the elephant, you don't sell this elephant...
World events are controlled by high powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only happen if it works to integrate it.
So far, it works at the level of economic and political (in selected questions), but military integration is still missing.
I personally think Europe is directing towards federalisation.
It will not be 10, 15 or 20 years old.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, moods will be different and this will be done.
It also ignored me and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so maybe a Slovakian.
Only I am based on the fact that ellipse mostly includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas “Spanish fruits and mandarins” are no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I am based on the fact that the sentence sounds “all American forces”, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in this broad term and it is not necessary to further specify for the US forces.
But again, you need only words :D
Whether it's so, or so, it's an unsensual requirement

Vicky Holland from Britain tortured the cap of cosman Milly
The decisive photographs show the moment when the sweetened monkey was crying in the toilet mission before her sensitive owner was flushing and hanging her.
Dutch monkey also feededed parks, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The magistrate court in Gwent now banned her lively animal breeding, informed The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of opices who care for Milly after her tyranny declared that such an excited space had never seen.
Milly spent nearly two years of rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset and now plays again with another saving monkey name Moon.
Four times the mother was admitted to two accused of unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the magistrate court in Gwent, she was imposed a twelve-year sentence of imprisonment with a suspended delay for one year.
Dutch was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-life ban on animal breeding and must pay at a cost of CZK 12,000.
Steph Sawier's leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the tyranny animal, said, "Milly is okay, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milli lasted before she was accustomed to people.
She cried and hid himself in front of everyone who met and any loud sound or sudden movement he shouted her.
She refused to eat her for a long time.
Even now, when she settled and satisfied with a male, her view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from tyranny will be accompanied forever, Sawier adds.
Tyranny Milly appeared after the police in Hwent discovered a horrible shot in a woman's phone after a shock in her apartment due to drug charges.
On the shots you can hear how Milly gives vulgar.
On another video it is to hear how Holland's monkey offers a cocaine and says, "Do you want a cocaine?"
So I'll get my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russel Cox (43) admitted to holding a cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (at least 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from this revision three times after you staticly cross the entire 20th century?
How do you take the same things as in the sixth class?
And all this kills the idea of bifling, when no one, honour excludes, won't know if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test on 1 and then it does not interest anyone.
Running and on the street random people ask if you can determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone has gone through, and the absolute majority will not scratch and tell you that they have absolutely in their teaching.
So what does it learn about?
I am a great fund of a general overview and the fact is that people don't want and have no need.
And at that moment it's unnecessary and you'll never get it equally to them.
This is partly learned for a lot of people who will need this thing.
But like, the note that on the walls of the machine you don't need it all, I thought absolutely seriously...... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we get slowly until you know the stamp of the punch.

Wedding at first glance: War of Kadri and Andrei continues!
What is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea replied to the instagram in Stories to all questions of raising fans, what she disappointed on Kadri so that she decided to terminate all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrei, it has been violined since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, i.e. at least until he returned to Bohemia.
But she refused to do so.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only ended with love, but rather grew into mutual respect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he started turning Kadra in response to Andreino's charges of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri now has not liked his younger sister Linde.
She decided to detain her brother publicly.
Normally, these things are not expressed at all and we never said too much extra in the family.
I don't want to definitely cause some regret.
But when I see someone trying to hurt publicly and dirty the name of someone I like so much, it just doesn't give me!
I am sorry that I have to do this, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri for having done his own character and helping our family when we needed it even the youngest age.
It's more fraudulent to me when I have to read such false information that is probably quite disappeared from the context.
I would all like to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and the family, is in recognition in response to the words of Andrei.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him all over and know the reality and know how it was actually added uncertainly.
The drunken thief was flooded on the facade on the fifth floor.
You don't believe what.
Cchao started his ski trip at the parking lot in the residential neighbourhood, where he tried to enter several cars.
According to the available information, the vehicle finally departed at least 330 crowns.
Then he thought nothing better than climbing on the 5th floor and climbing the open window into the apartment.
There were two bananas stolen.
On the shot from one security camera, it is then captured how to leave the street away from the place of action and at the same time rides the banana.
When the owner of the apartment wake up in the morning, he found that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
Then Cchaaa detained.
A man admitted that on an incriminated day he drank something alcohol.
And because he needed money, he decided to lie in despair.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilist or foreign politician?
I think this is all that people write here you know well.
Just play on the fool to be with whom to "think".
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or nothing such.
Even I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (which eventually was the goal to look good).
And I'm quite one who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am defective in how much church had too much money in the Middle Ages, how much money was recorded, suppressed science, etc.
Don't talk about all wars that caused, for example, the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetto monster, but the state and church do not have anything to do together
The man fell down from twelve metres.
Now the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, with rescuers of the Regional Health Rescue Service.
Employees of the Regional Operational Centre took an hour after Saturday midnight emergency call with the first information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two crews of ZZS - medical and medical.
After arrival in the place of healthcare, they found that a seventeen-year-old man had to fall from the window from about twelve meters high and impact his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice the coal caught.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went to the event.
At the time of arrival of rescue services teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct threat to life.
The intervening doctor invented his breathing path, provided artificial lung ventilation and, after further measures in the framework of pre-National urgent care, transported him a sanitary vehicle to the next care of the Ostrava Traumatological Centre, informed the spokesperson for the MSZ of the Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns than coronavirus from inadequate public and government responses
The broadening of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a call for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against infection is primarily physicians and medical personnel.
How important is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Rezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things are divided.
Julianna Penová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amandu Nunes, who did not find a winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, showed great scratches against Dustinu Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kay Kara-France, who quickly destroyed Cody Harbrandt by the technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one waited.
This brought women's bantama scales between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Pen.
The Americans entered the mutual battle as a thoughtful “throat”, for Nunes did not lose seven years and grinded her teeth to another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the path behind the victory a lot actively and the opponent even sent push kick to the ground.
However, foam was not forced to have any other mistake, and she tried to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was cutting and for MMA fans very tensile.
Both opponents participated in a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes got on the ground, where she began to cut her.
She had to try to give up and attack off.
The Americans thus prepared a huge shock when he became a new champion.
The top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was better managed, but the card began to turn.
In that second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to overcome the levers on his hand.
He didn't manage too much, but then he created great pressure, got the opponent on his back and hit him a number of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked hockey, to which Poirier had been resisting for a while, but then he had to scatter.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, for two years.
In the next match, he wrote a sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had already settled on Raulian Paiv in the first round hard right back.
He then won a number of precisely measured strikes and recorded fifteen triumphs.
Kara-France then managed to consult Cody Harbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now she lost for seven years.
Did he dig or dig you?
At first glance, nothing is difficult.
Most of the substantial names in Czech are expressed only by one grammatical family, and therefore there is no problem with them to determine whether it is a male, female or medium family.
Then there is also a relatively numerous group of substantial names in which the family is not fixed.
Such substantial names fluctuate between two families.
When inclining, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “sweesel” or “sweesel” are both male and female, in the first place they inclined according to the model “sweeper”, in the second according to the model “songs”.
For other groups of substantive names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, for example: row/row, cylinder/club or cylinder/potatoes (in the sense of food).
Both faces are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely substitutable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cucucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian version is unwritten, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "cumber" and "cumber", "cumber" and "cumber" etc.
Some words that penetrated Czech from other languages were originally inclined, but gradually accept Czech endings.
A typical example is the word “image”, which is a male and female family, or the word “buffet”, which remained in the middle family inclined, but has endings according to the pattern “hall”.
Turkey opened a journey for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look right on the Greek borders?
The Greek-Turkish border has tensions due to the growing number of migrants who are trying to reach Europe further.
Thousands of people began publishing to the southern border of Schengen after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece support, and the Czech Government is also undertaking humanitarian assistance.
What actually motivates refugees to the uncertain path?
And what does the situation look right on the spot?
Three months we didn't see blue heaven and we thought, a journalist from Sydney describes
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and disappeared millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves cope with disasters?
Can the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent drastic impacts, how hard critics?
And what countries will need to prepare for the future for climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalists from Sydney Iki Detřich.
False accusations were always and are quite rare.
Therefore, everyone is always written completely everywhere.
For people, it is unpleasant to solve both sexual violence in our society and both terrible expansion and try to order it.
I don't know personally anyone who was falsely charged.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and experienced how people often behave about their surroundings or police.
Victims should always believe.
The trend was that victims finally open up their trauma.
But it still leaves too much people for themselves.
Yes, even those who falsely accuse someone will find.
It is a angry and facial victim of sexual violence, but by disseminating the idea that "a large part of the accusations is thought" and that it is "trend" you only help sexual violence.
Czech Republic floods flooded houses, families do not have money to finish
Prices of construction material increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have reached the wedding situation.
There is no means to complete disposed of households and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already disposed of family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to disassembled and uncollaborated houses.
In the worse case, uninhabited houses are uninhabited, and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgage and to pay for it even rental," says economist Štěpán Kreček.
We will build two to three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them have happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even if the material irritated.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivon.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the building of the house to go for five million, now it will become seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivon.
The material was most affected by honey, iron, as well as installation and topping equipment.
However, construction companies also fight labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of structural fields and the influx of foreign workers brake the pandemic.
At this moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of construction permits is beneficial.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're going to be good and we'll be still better.
But actual vision is missing, says ČRO commentator – mujRozglas
In addition to classical celebrations, politicians have traditionally accompanied joining the new year.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and President of YES Andrej Babiš and the Christmas Message of President Miloš Zeman and the President of the Senate and the House of Deputies spoke to the people.
What is essential?
As in this, my diploma comes super right, I have my own theme I have chosen, follow the bachelor, I always do it all year round, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The villages are completely quiet, if a person is not a total poppy and something remains in his head, so he will not unnecessarily throw him on the theory.
I must have learned a week at the state station and when I was at the end, so my commission always tried to bring to some logical derivation that I was accompanied and I had the right thing.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to make them the semester project (we have done it a lot of times, really beneficial, a lot of learning) and then only learn the project and have to be obsolete.
According to me, it is super when at the end of the course there is an examination to which knowledge obtained within the project is demonstrated, not only defence.
But do not absorb any e-mails and phones and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same lens as they.
Those people in the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they might have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But quietly, next to the statue of the bear Pu put a similar statue of Putin.
You still need to put it in such a way that Xi Inping's ass or so.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under his feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, you will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function if the layer, comment or saved.
It's horrible to me recently succeed, so I may have to reduce to a tiktoke where a lot of artists from my branch have success and don't allow to do so.
Finally, I might also like to come something user-friendly, what does not scare from artists all creativity and energy
Statement by Donbas Workers
The union – yes, broken – no, express their opinion on the image by the opponents of the breakdown of the USSR.
Thirty years since the unlawful breakdown of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster took place in the history of humanity.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Elcin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open conciliating attitude of Michael S. Horbach, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “The Union of the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality stops existing”.
One thing of the feathers "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the disintegration of the USSR, dozens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were found abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Even before, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years in one seat in the Belovéžské forest betrayed the socialist camp (creating the prize of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, contaminated agriculture, rejected the world's largest power of fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked to a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, army, the growth of criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of a geopolitical chapter, the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been destroyed and devoted to ruin was quickly filled in and conquered by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical chapter.
And the whole world is so far cut mainly due to events from the end of the eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket worth 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with I put it in the refrigerator and make it on Thursday evening.
In an alternative reality in which I don't buy meat on Monday, it will be discounted to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - will you describe my mechanism, which of this meat will change its price to be an attraction for my digestive system?
And or wait to quarter and this meat will be discounted 1 day before the consumption date to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK on the road and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I will send myself - nothing.
These are the things that when something is cheap, so it must be guaranteed bad, disproportionate or unquality you are terriblely retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now I recently went to Heads in Brno and in the approach of dairy distributed some brochure, like things I always take to help brigades, they can't get it...
Well, the brochure was full of rural intelligence and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I found it to be a kind of agitation.
After reading, I found who issued it and finally came out of it scientology.
Well, like a good mattress, full of completely unnecessary picks, as I have to be taught and not learned.
A bad paper, because of this, the forests would not have to go.
I experienced something similar to the former girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional visualism force you to comply with this person because you like it without realizing how much it is in the p*deli situation.
Sometimes I was threatened with hurt because of this I went with a friend who was not happy to move out.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, I was asked to go on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year, it was a super relationship, but then it took another half a year and started to crash it on the stick.
Then I ended my relationship with it, and I told her to break out, but I can talk about it next week to calm it, and not to catch some amoke.
Such a person hangs your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
More preferably hold the distance
When the insurance companies are scratched by purchasing the cloud of tests and going to positive ones who would not be a test or know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of domestic imprisonment.
In the west they ceased with the chashkers and recognised that they had no price to solve the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something else and drive its thoughtful busting.
I'm looking back to the old good scar.
After several years of refusal and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment returns to the sun.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (which was 20 years old, the element at the university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "that may not be interested, especially people's seizure".
I was sincerely interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, however, the trainings were rather about how to scare and leak people.
When the first earned money came, man quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he must navigate several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgage were the only earnings, or then a man felt as a ground seller of pots.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump right on every top and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't all go into one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not be praised by expensive consumer goods or "fat" content.
In the corporate where I did not experience much such things.
HR is quiet, managers look at their management and they don’t squeeze us much into anything.
Regular evaluation is now somehow happening in the form of what is happening to us quite (see some goals for the next year, we look at what happened in a year and what is not) - it is rather self-evaluation than evaluating someone according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also not required.
But we are a little escaped in our company - they are separated from what are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels that we are a short startup that scoots in the offices of a large corporate no.
But this works so I don't poison us much until the results are.
The Czech is missing in Britain after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days the British police searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech who lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced James Kulhánek's demiss on social networks that women from Hungary were found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police today afternoon confirmed to our representative office in London that she found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not communicate more information to the case.
Honest sister, said on Twitter Kulhanek.
The young woman last seen on November 28 in the bus when traveling from work, before attending, she was still to pick up money from the ATM.
Her disappearances were announced by colleagues five days later.
After that, the London police began to search, Interpol included her among the missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this context have arrested one man a few days ago.
What role he had to play in the case and what he suspected of, but did not publish.
In four municipalities, new representatives were allocated by the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, in the villages of Komna in Hungary, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovna in Pelgrimovsko elected a new representative office.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.

The average age of candidacy was 46.6 years old.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday elections for us symbolicly closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to general representatives and, above all, very observed elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in the more challenging epidemic conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpova, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistics Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and post-approval will be published in the Laws Collection.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a totally dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning of the moment, but it went without more irritation.
To cope with how much of the population on all their layers becomes idiotic, I have a problem so far.
I am most looking forward to vaccination ( tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally depend on the fact that other people are not beaten.
He would be deprived of the presidency and the ability to recruit it.
The chance that this really happens is, but as others mention a lot small here.
Moreover, I am not sure if the writing of the writing would at all be considered a railroad.
The Iron Council is an act that threatens the President of the Republic to sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic nature of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How pandemic affected intimate life: Increased number of people under 35 years old who are without sex all year round
The more young adults in the USA live their lives without sex.
It is mainly religiously based people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who appear to have raised from eight to 21 per cent.
A woman between 18 and 35 years of age, who said they had no sexual intercourse in the last year, is more than ever before.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the research of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them can be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less prioritized for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35, who state that they did not have sex in the previous year," said IFS Liman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been sex-free in the past year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of pre-marriage and religious foundation is also contributed to the loss of sexual activity.
Although it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and committed under 35 years of age is still declining.
Young people divide the view on pre-marriage sex, about 30% of it has a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that there are minorities among free individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts this trend," says Stone about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage relations, the reason for religious foundation is.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60% for free people under 35 years of age, who participate in religious meetings more than once a month.
Between "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," said Stone.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interactions and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason can be the expansion of digital media that apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replace” this need.
This trend was mainly caught behind lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The entire vaccination against covid is whether society should force part of the population to behave, which they do not want, but which can save them life.
It is a relatively difficult question on which my personally most interested question of social conscience.
For example, the question whether if we do not rule them and they will die, it will be our wines.
My argument is that we could definitely die for the death of an eighty-year-old man who actually did not know much, we did not explain it well to him, heard some disinformation, and, as a result, did not vaccinate and eventually caught and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a confirmed vaccination vaccination resistance, which, on the side of the SPD and the CNR, takes something about the chic and totalitarian state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly imported that most of the unavailable pensioners are most likely to be part of the second group, so they will really be able to do so.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter sign up to fight dry?
This summer winter has yet to bring one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic recently.
The ski area operators do not worry without technical snow, the weather complicates for example the preparation of ski resorts Jizera fiftieth.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight dry in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a panbichker in her.
Once on the middle of us, the teacher led across the whole city on the boat so that we could go on the boats along the river.
We went there once such a very wide street and whom we probably do not see in the middle - accomplices of the sect Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Of course, they met at us.
I fortunately fled, but with one friend they went into speech.
When she left them, we asked her with her teacher what she said to them.
"I asked if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul," she replied.
All, including a teacher, we laughed all the way to the boat.
We are terriblely blurred.
It doesn't happen so much, but the system is already grit, says Orozović
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We open a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders is appreciated to solve using diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the “Norman Group”, associating France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that Chancellor informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because at night we record hundreds of attempts (illegal) to cross borders.
The Chancellor discussed other sanctions to finally understand Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko's regime with refugees.
Drunk Polish regolnica blamed the accident, she tried to secret it
The car returned to the place of an accident for a while, but the car controlled another eptic that tried to take guilt on itself.
When police officers told her that it could not be preferred to drive and accidentally arrive at the driving licence, she went out with the truth, she said TVN24.
She acknowledged that another petitioner had arrived in the vehicle, who asked her for help.
Policies then came for the sister Celestine.
The breathing tests were also undergone, and after they found that they had over two passes in the blood, they immediately removed the driving licence.
At the same time, they announced that they would report to the court.
Dog Gugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmović, however, did not care for his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked at in American priests about dogs of lovers.
However, they forgot a substantial thing: the legitimacy of the film craft.
After the coach film F. Brabce Hump - a dog who taught people to live, we are looking for another picture here.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows my previous film Here I watch here from 2012.
On the scene, the speaking songwriter Hugo returns and some well-known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the Shumav Pension, who is scoming, will begin to invite the dog, Juliin the father with a partner and mainly her daughter Veronika.
It is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who lives the first love.
The director with the partner Beatriz Shajmović (which is also the producers of the film) faced the procedures described in the previous dog's image, but at least children and dogs enjoyed it.
This time she wrote a creative pair of even weaker scenarios that causes a mixture of amazingness and feelings of patience.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although the scientists, is in the desire for a child with dark wiseness and if the right “constellation” comes, cooperates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), served Colonel Mojmir despite the flying training of shots in the forest his own daughter (Julia), who falls into the comate, whereby the family is taken away by the hospital so that in the heart of the Shumav lonely can play a miraculous process of healing the dog.
Nothing against cleaning treatment of nature and the strength of animal soaps.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer appreciates what content he had filled with unprecedented situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two thiefs from the staff, the competition of pejskars, the Shumavski šarlatan, the police coming to search for "roads" and discussing herbs about the fertile strength of bone balls – and which the family in the pension is of course opposite.
When the hero takes care of the heavy commodity and sits naondulated and poured with a cigar at the family table and requires father whisky and flacotta as cured vegetarian, it cannot be confused.
On top of this, the audience’s creators explained that “this is sometimes happening after the comate”.
Shajmovich’s team lacks basic dramaturgic knowledge of working with text, the ability to exhibit bearing situations, feel for characters and point characters and directorate.
Actress performances are unbalanced, the cut is irreparable and the overall impression of excitement.
Whether Lukáš Váculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand up their party, they don’t have too much to play.
The only layer of the film remains the poetic shots of the Shumav nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of filmmakers.
It is not enough to depict a few characters, chambers and dogs of glashes, as well as more folk vulgar expressions that the characters are allowed.
You are not even flying membership in the Club of breeder breeder - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship of man with a dog, the knowledge of the craft must also be if a person wants to tell a faithful story.
This did not happen in this case.
On a good family picture there is a little bit of erotic and a minimum feeling for the genre.
Not even as an advertisement on canisterapia, this amateur conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant supplements exactly from flaws like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcedness, here you can see them how you understand it, but this is just because you have never experienced it.
The decision is always on the customer if he does not want, the answer will always be not.
If you listened to the furt, you might change your opinion.
It's a job like everyone else, in which it's a brigade of ghosts.
The nearest east is an unusual dry month.
Winter is the only period in the year when it rains.
“This complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, Kfar Giladi village in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average in November.
Rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It didn't happen for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas balloon, rejoiced by the inhabitants of Nazareth Wassim Ashkar.
Cloudy in Israel comes almost exclusively in winter months, they are shocky and irregular.
On winter rains are dependent forests.
Without them they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supply and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water farmers have warned before dry for a long time.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall can be killed here,” said Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as wastewater disposal or recycling.
Mountains are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tank cars arrive.
The waters and private wells dry.
“Summer orders rose from seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” Imad Sulejman said in September.
In Iran, Isfahan disappeared clashes between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protest was dry.
The root of the local river felt completely without water.
The region has the dryest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing military intervention against Iran
The Israeli Minister of Defence stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and that he informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz announced that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lys informed.
Gantz, who lives in the USA, is trying to convince the Americans of their pressure on Iran, but also informs Washington of military preparations.
During the press conference at Florida Gantz, he said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world's power "it understands that the Iranians play with them".
About 3 years ago this happened too.
I fell a bit and grilled at the interview to find out what I wanted to do after me.
Finally, I found my suspicion of pyramid was legitimate.
Because I really don't like these subfusions, so I am a daughter of doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked and left.
Quietly tell me that I'm dirty, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains for a weekend, waiting for enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first larger emphasis of skiers this weekend.
After a significant snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snowfall and some skiers started operation.
The skiers did not dismiss the obligation to demonstrate a certificate of covideo for lifts.
While the lifters do not complain about customers’ inconvenience, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country trails and pistes.
The skiers laund the weather that offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, this starting weekend has actually gone since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," he praised the interest of the director of the Sports Facility Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, they had a Ski Arena Karlov or a resort in Bránn in Šumpersk.
Weekend visit was very decent, estimated at 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are accompanied.
Today the sun lighted, there were about three degrees, so the perfect one did not save praise by the representative of the ski resort in Bránna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski operators can sell a ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after the disease covid-19.
Until the exceptions are people ready for this and demonstrate the necessary documents, ČTK Rene Groneš said from the Ski Center Špindlerův Mlín.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before pandemic voices some rental and sales ski equipment.
Fortunately, interest in ski rental is.
It is not like in recent years, but still customers are enough, said Alexander Bokišov from the Skyopava shop in Opav.
Greater emphasis is expected during the period of ski courses.
The leader of the Royal Hradecian company Snowbear David Šintak feels that due to covid, there is no interest in renting ski equipment such as before.
These times before the pandemic we have been almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we were about 50 percent, said Šintak.
People, according to him, were destroyed with pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand records the rental in the Nováky area in God's Dar.
The ski rental started there a week ago and interested people must now order them in advance.
“We start leasing cross-country tickets this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect great interest as well as last year,” said the operator of the Pavlina Novakova area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also noted in the ski school.
If we want successful and rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to find a dentist or a doctor of a specialist.
Abroad leaves smart and chic people who have no property here.
The owner of the company abroad does not only go so.
But with the rest, absolutely consent.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not just live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban on one beautiful day, reigning the year and at the same time raising the annual emigration by a few tens of thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic from day to day cannot feel in a similar position.
Another question is the choice at all.
When there is a foolish life, there can also win a traditional V4 maid.
Youth and education will leave, remain its supporters and people whose property cannot be cut into the aircraft.
Desive photo!
Langmajer in blood due to betting about beer?
While in the Czech Republic was full of autumn, in Thailand, the headquarters of the film Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor published a bloody photo of the face on social networks.
Is it just injury, or is it a drawing for shooting?
The London police are still looking for an unknown Czech.
The last time was seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior and we begin to have great concerns about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where she worked.
“Their family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns and in short wants to know where they are,” she continued.
According to her on Sunday 28 November, about 19:45 she left her work and headed home to Camberwell district.
The last time was reportedly seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by some of their colleagues.
According to the British media, Srnc worked as a "Healthcare Assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
“We have extreme concerns about our expensive colleague Petr, who is unknown,” said a group of medical facilities in the twitter contribution.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find it to contact the police,” the communication continued.
Ambassador Harriet Harman also invited the public to collaborate on Saturday on the case of Srnc during the press conference.
"It's not known for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understood to be obsolete," said Labourist politician, holding photos of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have special responsibility to try to find it, because it was outside of my home country, away from the family and worked here for our health care," said Harmanová.
The police had previously detained one man who remained in prison.
According to the BBC intelligence website, however, the police did not provide any information about the identity or the identity of the man.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTH (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't even appreciate Ukraine.
This is not a "multiple quantity", but about 8 per cent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that the threat of Invasion increases and begins to have our input full of teeth.
I felt at the top.
I don't know what he found Russia wants to war.
The war is an expensive legacy and Russia has a GDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is outside the points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this already with the First Punish War and the "anexis" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not comply with agreements from Minsk, Russia announces the funny republics.
This is all and this would be the "concentration" on the borders so matched.
Yeah, pacta sunt servanda...
New schedules are valid in Prague since Sunday, touch mainly suburban connections
Travelers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially in suburban connections.
There were new lines, some changed the route, and otherwise disappeared.
Mladoboleslavia is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital since Sunday I stop fasting from České Budějovice in the Garden City station.
In the suburban train transport, trains S7 are going through the Prague Main Station on the route from Berin to Bohemian Brod.
In the newly operated station Prague-Zahradní Město will newly stop R17 from České Budějovice and Benešová.
PID is newly expanded to other areas.
Otherwise, buses will go to Svitlá nad Sazavou, Blatná near Jesenice, Old Splavs and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslav, including lines with crossing to Liberec and Králové Hradec Region.
When integrating, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will go from Prague Zlíčín to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection between Prague and Královíce near Rakovník, which replaces the cancellation of the S53 train line.
They will be reinforced in the morning of the top and on the weekend of connections from Prague to Rakovnik, when new express line number 404.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 to Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Strižkov, not from the station Nadraži Holešovice.
The 400-way line goes through Melnik, Duba and Czech Lipa to New Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 additional line goes through Melnik and Duba do Doks, Mimone and Jablonne in Podještěda.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of medieval local routes, including Mochov, Dobriš or Rožmital under Třemšín.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Berin, Prague – Lisa nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on Line 420 from Dobriše, followed by Prague, where you can use PID tickets to Milevská.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 to Nimburg were changed and the routes of some buses on the borders of Central Bohemia and Gorovice in the Pilsen Region are adjusted.
Healthy snack/ lunch in the supermarket office
Hey, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option where to find food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lila.
Since I have no movement, I have no power to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy as possible and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy maximum pizza jelly and to the snack yogurt and apples.
Question: What healthy without heat treatment would you recommend to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Only the top of the tree can hide under the snow.
If the tree is destroyed, the tree can be more prone to mushroom disease.
I don't claim that this is the only reason why they prohibit us from riding outside the slopes, but it's one of them.
Recognition of the Gifts of Relationship with Nedved: I didn't find it at all
Czech show business pond from Friday than nothing else than revealing the relationship between Dari Rolins and Paul Nedved.
It has been pulling together since the summer, the famous footballer even let him divorce due to the singer.
The gift now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she secreted love for half a year before them.
“I am allowed to claim that there is no one currently in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would escape that Dara caught bear, now pardon, Nedveda,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to the ears.
But they packed her, not on the contrary.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to the public, they have no joy.
And it's here.
What we both didn't find, but we knew that the singer continues to do so once.
I just don't know who's on the mountains.
If those who are not interested in it at all and jump it on them and from the preserve, or we whose lives dive in detail.
As if someone of you would like to hear an opinion whether you fit with yourself with your husband or girlfriend, or you insisted that but really everyone knows the list of your former partners and are familiar with the reading of your mistakes and errors.
It's a stranger, you want it, Dare's defects.
She gave herself together in Italy, where Rolins rided due to the preparation of her new fashion collection.
He has long been the Vice-President of Juventus Football Club.
With the truth, he went now because they were waiting for the end of Nedved's divorce.
Ivana's wife has been distinguished for three years, but the papers are not their own but only three weeks.
In any event, to those who are happy with us and wish us this, thank you.
And we are only people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
Therefore, I love my new man, and I stand with him, and I close Rolins in good and evil.
Hello, the other commentators have probably said everything substantially, I just confirm that the colleagues are super at the beginning, my collaborators mostly familiar with during the first semester or two familiarized, and then found the societies together, which will come to me as the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Most apartments do not advertise too long in advance, so you probably do not find it too much now, but look at the offer will certainly not damage.
Otherwise, not only Cejl but also the surroundings (the streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), but some parts of Jewish are a little ghettos.
On the contrary, the district of Veveri is a lot of students, the Queen of Field and the direction is fine, in addition, it is close to most faculties of VUT (unsure where you are exactly coming).
I've never been hiring now, but I've been born Brnák, so I can consult Brno as if you still missed any information :)
But this is an example of a completely "normal" consideration.
Due to what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely okay that the state does not fund some schools sufficiently.
Whether they learn what they want and pay it from their own or whether they eat according to the state and pay it to the state.
However, we cannot allow a private actor to control a piece of education only because a few crowns will be able to learn what he wants to make a full state contribution, and thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such claims are somewhat lost on the weight when a person writes it, who two days earlier expressed such a petition for the fighter of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against that if someone goes to abortion is the same as the voice against any statue to stand on the square?
I would consult you directly with the person who asked you the job.
Otherwise, I already experienced cataloguing/digitalization that (and even long-term professionals) it either fits from the eye, or records something on the way xxx ***** or ... (according to the convention) and notes that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
I would personally deal with this in probably somehow in the note on which program you use.
If you would like to be a proper and trying student, you can look at some character databases and search for the closest one.
But because it looks like you draw from some book, I would like to advise that the author or printer simply created his own character that sits on what is physical on the coin.
PS: Isn't it accidental rather the Odessa Empire (Kingdom) than OdriNsk?
PSS: someone has already distinguished it here.
Make a look at the comment with Φ🇪G
Politicians do not even know what will be a "theme" of our Presidency.
This is much worse than that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something, because no one understood any text, is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined by the word from the word, to the same basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the case of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is suitable for informal contacts, superstandard relations.
Moreover, with those English it is quite interesting, after the performance of the GB from the EU.
I don't understand that gate on Cejl.
For the third year I have been working there and completely fine.
I'm going from work I at 10 evening and never a problem.
That is that ghetto can only tell someone who almost didn't work there in life.
Yeah, there were about most of the Romani populations in Brno, but only what they do is that they obstruct on the pedestrian and park where they don't have :D definitely it's not that I'd be afraid to climb there in the evening.
So if you are looking for a relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, so I would walk to it calmly.
There are now newly reconstructed or newly built apartments.
Felix Slovak (78) without Uncle and the lover of Helem as a bike in the fence!
Who dies Christmas?
On Sunday, most people on the advent wreath burned the first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I have no advent wreath, so it was not what to ignore.
Uncle's wreath I saw and Lucie certainly also has someone, said Blesk saxophonist who confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
She visits, but they were not in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
The Slovakian still doesn't know where it's going to be for the Christmas evening.
Recently we met with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Helemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček a Lucie Helemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we still talked about something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
Gifts buy continuously and Dade and Lucia certainly buy something, probably a perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the cross of a music video clip to Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to meet, says the Slovakian who was glad to meet the wife of Ludka Sobota Adrian or singer Kamil Nivlt.
And they gave it a clear idea.
And we are Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be completely idiot so that this territory is not located.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, do you explain to me now?
I do not know any other ingredient that could be applied in hospitals in the crisis.
Police are small and cannot afford it, as well as firefighters, and nowhere else is the high percentage of healthy trained people at such level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava so akorat goes to the head of previous governments, not armies, ask you for new toys for quite a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst dry period in the last summer.
Water, according to scientists, killed in mountain and suburban areas, smaller rainfalls also record places where there has not yet been an emergency of moisture.
The causes of dryness in large part of Central Europe are climate change.
However, the impacts also strengthen the way we manage with soil.
What about dry preparation?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it will be so, I will still keep in ice skates, mushrooms I know what is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) is also the overall industry.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so play two goals even if you don't have to win them differently for each prize than when compared.
But as I listen to Czech commentators what they dream, whatever men's or women's ice hockey notice, it's all strange, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And if it was opposite as if it was always elsewhere, and that the Czech Republic with Russia more often lost than it won, probably it would be a classic "war lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of injuries in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily injuries.
Hospitalized is 5766 people.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, a further 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100,000 in the Czech Republic, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain faced "inevitable" large wave infection caused by Omikron, said on Sunday on the TV Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Security Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Persons infected with omicrone are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
Nobody died at the omicron yet, but hospitalization occurs about fourteen days after infection and died about three weeks after infection.
Keyr Starmer, head of British labyrists, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by organizing a Christmas quiz last December when lockdown was introduced and a Christmas party was banned at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government gave the quiz "virtually" through a computer.
However, they participated in the Downing Street Group of Employees collected around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the premier function is strong.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous messaging despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are confident that Johnson and his government have done legacy:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Television Editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the cruel majority in general elections.
Today, the Conservative Party says that it is necessary to remove it from the premiere function.
Considerable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to rotate and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Viktor Orban.
This will be the choice of European importance.
How much can you expect to be ferry?
They will not be ferry.
They will not probably be free, because they were not even the last two elections under Orban.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to gain from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last sounds so far that everyone can choose where he wants in practice.
This allows Fidesz to convert voters from district decisions to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that the fair will not be at all.
Do you think it will be the same nefer as in 2014 and 2018?
For the situation is significantly different.
It was first about whether Fidesz won, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a unified opposition.
This is a great unusual for Victor Orban and his side.
Will not try to keep much to play even harder?
Yes, we have some signs that you are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, she escaped to independent media a recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz Laszloa Köver, where the heads of secret services interpret that the opposition is threatened to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, this is one of the news.
Everything begins with the language.
I was quite often, last in 14, my mother's parents do not have much patience, I'm also not, her dad has long, but then I would be extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was a lot cholerical and I fled like a little terrible, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in the shrimp and was entire blue, it was about 2 times taken under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes I was screaming up, sometimes it was more likely that they no longer knew.
I am definitely also tended to solve things by violence, as little as I wanted, now for discharging at least something next, and as younger as I need parents, I cried through my hands for example (to get no power through the holder), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have this force.
I am not able to determine to what extent this is my explosiveness, but certainly my proportion also raises you.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve the same thing.
I think that to be children is simply bad and that my parents should not do it, especially at the moment when it was no longer “introductory,” but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply possesses something, probably it is not possible for my children not to eat at least a little, so I do not count it to them.
I don't miss it, I don't understand why OP should stand for something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
I would therefore call Kundami what laws create in such quality.
Otherwise, would I be interested in whether you are not afraid of income failures?
You can really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have what mortgage to pay from?
The nomadic sludge world.
Where does Slovakia move the process with the enemies of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main lecture begins in the process of square appeals against the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kochner and his involvement in the top Slovak policy and justice.
How will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists can be behind this huge.
How is it possible that this petition has regularly more media attention than the anti-petition of the dean of all medical faculties, which came out by day, two later?
On the other hand, they were going to blame and the society was getting off.
On the Czech television died with covid another half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal by Minister Karl Havliček needs to be substantially redrafted
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end and the law, which should ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens when choosing and authorizing the deep storage of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Government after aviation prosthetics by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is seriously contrary not only to the communities concerned associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also to the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects a stronger strengthening of its possibilities in repository decision-making, which is promised by the Mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech atomic law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to redraft the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform available, refers to the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of repository sites is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a general intention almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes citizens practically just a statistical figure in authorisation proceedings.
The design misses systemic compensation settings for municipalities for the whole process of searching and choosing a location for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities really have no excessive opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in searching for repositories.
Only in some authorisation proceedings may submit their comments or appeals, however, the Office or Minister decides to issue the authorisation.
The case does not have a delay in carrying out research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-government that the Platform calls for is the principle of common use in many democratic advanced countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced in repository permits, as in Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, among other things, another failure of the state administration to hire an external legal office for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which concluded SURAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemank.
The total amount for these works is to be almost CZK 4 million according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, the vice-chairman of the village Cejle from Hradek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of industry who streamlined the position of self-government against government authorities in search of depth storage of highly radioactive wastes only sent to their successors, we are waiting for a stronger turnover from the new government.
We also offer an auxiliary hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for its support, which considers the issue of insufficient municipal rights in such a fundamental building as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the State's access to burned nuclear fuel management and other radioactive wastes that will not be limited to depth storage only.
The Platform further encourages the decision to select a location for any storage to be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear to lose weight: Harmonized 90 kg.

They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
And it took it.
Goodman gradually agreed 90 kilograms, which is half of its original weight 180 kg, informs The Sun.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the thickness of the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different man!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his big body caused cracking furniture.
"I all shook in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Fuck, exercise.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use in.
If it is a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it would be a formal and, perhaps, a university text, I would probably be looking for how boss would rather describe or explain.
There are more types of boss to all.
The game like Dark Souls, etc. has a few boss that yeah, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler of the given level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games are hidden by boss (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat at all so that the game or level is completed, but are often even stronger than standard boss.
Then you need Half-Life games where the boss are, but the player is not directly scared with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called at all?
And then they are mini boss.
It is unambiguously unambiguous to translate boss simply probably nowhere, Czech and neither other languages do not solve it (interestingly, only Catalan, which bosse translates as the final opponent).
It is shortly for a story or game generally important, computer control, enemy stronger than all previous and watching completion of some level or task.

Czech police also participated.
After Peter Srnc's disappearance, the British police have been patrolling since December 3.
Czech police also participated in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been looking for since December 7.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.

The Czech Republic terrorizes the Tesla Agent.
While data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns in October, last month, the attacks were significantly reinforced by the end of the year.
We witnessed a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
Attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of attackers remains the same so far.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should draw attention to the names that refer to payments and financial transactions in the user.
While last month it had a dangerous attachment to the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the receipt correction for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Irkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Any code actively searches for saved login data that is subsequently sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the coming holidays and end of the year attackers will grow again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook was slightly weakened in November, but it remains worth a few fifths of all detections.
Attacks continued throughout the month with increased activities on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contains the most common attachment to the .exe file extension that was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decline and suppressive activity are recorded by security analysts at Fareit, who stood at 1.6 per cent of attacks and had no more attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.

Sometimes I have such an impression that they rent the same podium and technique.
It is difficult to say what movement would be dissatisfied with this dissatisfaction, not only depends on the influx of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become a square or more dose.
It will certainly not move left or middle, bet it.
The triple-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose, because it is apparent that we will have to be vaccinated every half of the year.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
Genial action of scientists on whom humanity is proud.
