The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# a major customer and so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should enclose with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a role as a parent for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes take a quick look, help briefly, bring the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this suits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but I don't want to think of the title partout anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about anxiety and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his big cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide and to document and to put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another deliberately drives herself to death)
Facing fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for Wi-Fi available.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" loudspeaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log on to a suitable digital control center fully automatically.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable control panels.
For control panels that can only program the CVs from 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
More and more Omikron cases are causing politics and science in Great Britain.
By New Year's Day, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. Dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation came by e-mail.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not a "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick an official over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had an apparent defect in sales.
How else can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
However, this has been working for approx.
14 days.
That's why I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something of the soul.
I (21) come into more frequent contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What good is the series for "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a review of the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, this did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby even more than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma should be mentioned as a proxy: The triple rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) with a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't implement what we trained."
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already trailed 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the giants welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
we used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yes, I got in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally got in touch half a year ago.
Always as if from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 – "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other of his performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe loved to sing a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. Dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation will not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in Berlin in a referendum.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies, for example, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Traffic Light coalition on further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market nevertheless does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be lamented.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometer-long path of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado had crashed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That is a great pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
by when do you get in touch?
If the delivery can not be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned or given up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He has moved to a company about which he has blasphemed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he did not sew himself into his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I make a screen shot.

Help with your first own campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I am currently leading the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts are made up and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further plot should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins are said to lurk the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
If not noticed, the goblins lurk the heroes in a hollow path and flank the cart armed with three left and right arches, while two stop the cart with spears.
Should it come to battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village schoolboy, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-eleven intervenes with two of its servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of solution 2 is?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed to take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
If you can then let the return receipts come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again ignorance of the rules among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that verstappen had this possibility.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork, which is now possible or prescribed by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that this is a matter of taste.
But I even really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, both of which simply make them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the exception of advertising in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hi, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and that still isn't being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a décor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to mention.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outlet or similar... and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if water were to run backwards, the water from the basin running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
Mk Series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, so is packed daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,... they have a damn hard time
This is also very different from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly crowned astronauts on their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space right away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometres
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers above Earth as the border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned all-outing: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin deputy chief Executive Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject itself quite exciting and even being in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely like to and will study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially depressing the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would be really interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really unsure at the moment and am thinking about breaking off my studies in 2022 and training as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience there, please write them :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there is also before holidays plus bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Ascension" here in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies make a bridging day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails, which absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *necessarily* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that should not be?
Or because people in all seriousness want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What is the point of this self-assay because of holidays?
Why then do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves to them properly?!
Mind you, the stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: Is that just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it
Unfortunately still does not work
GDR handicraft model old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railroader ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network,  perhaps the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we refurbish it for operational purposes
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive capable of carrying 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The top speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When the need for locomotives for heavy freight train service arose with the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining engines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable that the number of refurbishments of the E 94 could not be further increased did the E 95 become the focus of the refurbishment.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Bahnbetriebswerk Halle P in 1960.
In a separate circulation plan, they were mostly used in front of coal trains from the Geisel Valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it often happened that contactors remained stuck during switching actions.
Then the beimann, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to release the gunners with a hammer and wooden wedge during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of locomotive failures.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most splinter classes, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one-manly, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time until those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is looked after in a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional bw Halle P community have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
Initially, the main area of application was Silesia
Manual work model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive in own work is necessary, dusty, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam can not be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent?
no no flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfil their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get them sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential building fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to live without electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely remedied in the late evening.
Firefighters and thw helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at around 7:15 p.m., according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those last affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighborhood help.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire brigade equipment houses when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER #
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them into each other and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it will not be suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate your feedback
yes that's really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
do you send me the return slip by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this
Nordic Combined: Combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

Return of the order number #NUMBER #
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have made both s new and use version 4.5...
could be that they have often heard of problems
Bought directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File is possibly incorrect they report to customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back and forth swiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve a true-to-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit is easier to glue before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each decal you need individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slide pictures because you briefly moisten their back with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check whether the image fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Suction excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place to where I have read.
ON Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
ok anyway thank you very much!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But will I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment at PKV / What is an "insured event"?
Hello everyone
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, this suddenly turns out.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility in advance at the PKV and got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost assumption at the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically settle the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the GTC, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again
All right.
We will not order anything more from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment has been arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help that the dresser arrives completely distraught
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a refund by #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG #
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition of exactly what a low-budget film is with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about this:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Sincerely,
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on The border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in the long term, said the researcher from the Berlin Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus does not give in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a member state sets its mind on doing its thing," as poland is currently doing, not even allowing the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, bossong said: An agreement in principle on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authority on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken in violation of the rules.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check that.
I talk to the bank and contact you again
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organises SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sports Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is this €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 World Champion.
Max Verstappen did it.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I left the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it to their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are just as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God got the whole thing going.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass into the edge zone without practically forgiveness and color error.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many a curious situation when selling fir trees.
Once a man is said to have even gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a spinning skewer.
And both therefore have their name.
On German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems to build a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also receives it.
However, the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I distance myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection on the first floor is now even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change your checking account
Anyone who would have thought that now there would be peace in the current accounts, is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the call money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even been proved right in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly set aside provisions - in the event that the upper instances also declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the head of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a ride up and down.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance is taken care of by a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans alike still fly to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she is simply unlucky with luck - and still looking for the great love.
And has removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the gang, Raikkonen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the premier class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. Dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins the two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I've calculated that, I would have to score nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second on Saturday, in which he drove from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove on Sunday with 0.30 seconds a larger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also took his 22nd victory in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who drove for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after second place earlier.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte took her third victory of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to world cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What shall I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it was said that he had expired which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken off yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered would.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one - or the other - will feel the same way...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or go to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together since 6Y) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
On top of that, he is chilled and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x week) which makes me very difficult with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which of course we divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well adjusted, I am reasonably well treated and get along.
Not good, but I get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll grab the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would certainly find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you in any case a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now, I will get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Incidentally, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and that for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
True culture or something like that?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? Like to write in English that I also understand well
This has been going on for a very long time, then I would refrain from doing so.
Is good, thank you.
I expect a response in the near future, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live for himself, I mean.
I think the crossing is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight against each other.
If that tells you something, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the stomach?
Or is it with the face in front Directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We also all grew up and when my husband was born, it was e.g. common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought many items
But then why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station are now under all sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that it is an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a running advertising column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a return call, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not so well.
The cherry pit cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or burn stains and, if present, dispose of immediately.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover beforehand to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the information provided by the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensation.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores leak, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
Any serious incidents involving the device shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the basement of the table.
For Ingolstadt it does not work even under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
No indication, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
Then I removed the battery, but again nothing happens.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters capacity can also be swallowed by larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: First, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
So the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest downside of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you want to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# gave me an email yesterday from confirmation for the commissioning of the
Contact announced by the forwarding agent to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I came further than the promise that I will receive an e-mail as a confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME #
It is foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you a nice evening
hello, my order is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I could not have guessed that the past year went differently than expected and I was not able to redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the pane.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure a high level of comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the bleeds improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man spotted glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone – the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playstyle with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving carts, setting up tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are complete, the pioneers return.
The promoter rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available promotions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, i.e. has hidden each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players have to defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final rating takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourself, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! to go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his or her development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discuss the abolition of the obligation to test for triple-vaccinated persons
The health ministers of the federal states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test obligation can be omitted for three vaccinated people," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this as early as next Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, less often to seeing pictures and least rarely to perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the detachment.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia preliminary discussion.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
Misread her comment.
However, the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 € do not help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money there.
I already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can carry me the heavy furniture to the first floor.
won't I be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, hot off the press: "An old man is getting older".
The harrowing diarium of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify to my gratitude for life here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not recorded

Roulade Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
This was available for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I have got a taste for it and would like to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle stock for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can do it
IEs is for a refund of €#NUMBER #
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where to get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve fleet, if it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also get a VFS5 foot switch, you can also call up the sounds comfortably by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is there then a possibility to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iran, progress is emerging in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement were continued after a break of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have exceeded the 1000 mark in terms of corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be reporting delays.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery does not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes an impudence.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Wozu the post office here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: It is notextistent.
We got into a winter stiffness and extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Wo is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this may simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here are still really keen on the MBundestag.
#Was we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, which has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who would like to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not a bad thing, we end up with the Discord.
If you feel like it and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to do that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pick-up appointment.
Are there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time, I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that there was resentment on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without putting it on it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment wagon of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be a permanent increase in operations: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and hope for help now.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for facing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go into further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course also in a special uniform and weapon carrier people to the right of conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course hardly deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gays,  because in the executive there are rather less or not at all but quite normal men and women who you do not notice it if they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in case of doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds strange at first, even if it sounds strange at first, in my experience, they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to please them, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans endangering the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing comrades of opinion meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so involved internationally and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket available in Germany somewhere.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Neater by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left behind, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never really the case "that someone could spontaneously come to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time household just loses to work and displeasure.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and e.g. there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows an almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wide embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and squats)

Career in social work – as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been training for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for some time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has already become better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("again the simplest things pooped") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do that myself by now"/"I keep him from work with my stupid questions"/"he really has to consider me to be under-resourced" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But you have already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of this.
I'm waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do they mean by giving back please!
When I download a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the feed in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and in turn builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs to form plumage.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be returned.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water / soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water / food daily.
One level measuring spoon (lying) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the beginning of the new plumage formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is passed until the plumage formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an email on Monday to let me know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So felling application submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Well, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is currently thinking through everything that can be thought through.
Before I dig out here now.. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I will not name anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
The times before that, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time the last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down – if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I would like to have it that way for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter like this now. but most of the time is the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I won't have arrived at the same place as now and be dissatisfied.
You notice, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, that I'm completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for a maximum variety of sounds will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly depicts the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with a attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are not photo-like.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data are available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told the state TV channel RTVE.
Losses in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new headlands with a combined size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with the gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were presented to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into three women's window one night in order to spare them another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the custom, which is popular in Germany, of filling the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants opposed this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "worship of saints."
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, it annoys only a few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the St. Martin's custom with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you will find everything your heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful muddle about the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia Father Frost brought it to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle, which could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The luminaire is easily set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Burn time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color inside.
»Smart Stone«, on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar luminaire shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: this modern light object presents itself like a naturally shaped large pebble during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar luminaire, »Smart Stone« requires neither a supply cable nor batteries.
Place the »light stone« in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied earth spikes ensure a firm hold if required.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, »Smart Stone« begins to glow automatically; in which color, you decide for yourself: Six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a given minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this several times before it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, is actually my first post after a year of reddit.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and shit PMS before my period.
Now I would like to let it stay again, because I have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples during my last two-year break from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it burdened me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without gedöns, but maybe there is what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynecologist did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had a lot of bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodule lichen and the acne topic.
I also diet in the course of chr. Illness tried everything possible and got stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It can also be good that hormonally simply the worm is in it, but if you have like me everywhere construction site you just don't want to go looking for what else is wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague semina or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but does it generally exist in large sizes
since it is available in black large

110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours at the moment.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me every hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can help me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation around the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about slumps in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-daily use, sales slumps are to be lamented, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in the food retail trade and in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G in shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel deployment.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer only had to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the wristband received on that day.
In addition, in the retail trade - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies without 2G were last at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the revenues at about 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". Dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and got it delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it shut.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the luminaire is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press one of the memory buttons for a long time and you're done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when the known situation is switched on again - Very practical in studio work when e.g. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it is too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, who had been winless twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration over a mixed start to the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have achieved today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and pronounced a "blanket praise, to every single one who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like another dampener for the Frankfurters, who are now still in ninth place behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought the Leverkusen with 2:0 in the lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and was happy with a look at the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all players are physically in top shape.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players are also highly professional.
Now they want to "go further step by step and remain modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
Right now I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would then unfortunately mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women crept off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain we have to act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round Group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone, which we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase against the World Cup runner-up of 2019 next Tuesday is needed to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed with the kick-off.
Missed throws and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game was at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also red.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into the game a little better and by the break at least five goals.
The already only faint hope of catching up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19 gone.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer bring itself to an increase in performance and left the floor as a clear loser.

The title dictates, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished to a large extent, some of them will continue for me in vaccination centers afterwards.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, is compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the information for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccine order and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they can not (may?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations there myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" (We in Bavaria) has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unrated by callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "person who's nervous."
And also not one "for whom everything has to go quickly".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinates.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
The following error message always appears after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for road bikes - really so puncture proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour in the coming week.
Said and done and I started with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to do the rest of the track under any circumstances.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't quite as bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, has torn off the day I picked up the bike until 2 pm 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he has ridden with them for several years on roll.
But when I think about the fact that I still have to change tyres after 80-90kms, then I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€/tyre now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
They are also available (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use different tires for a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to me absolute! Layman's knowledge rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car hurled against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-Year-old had crashed on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a central island and then on the opposite lane, as the police announced.
There it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-Year-old.
The car of the 53-Year-old was then thrown against a tree and the man trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would again have offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a suitably designed foot is directly included in this construction proposal to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but sonically an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is common practice for widebands in order to optimize the excessively high frequencies of strongly increasing bundling.
The SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The referenced extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final optics of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes in the construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto them.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, e.g. if you want to use finished strips from the HARDWARE store instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
A round cutter is then used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blown out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and unabridged cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and lets it protrude there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and let it hang out there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions Switch Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed in place with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Chill out for drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
