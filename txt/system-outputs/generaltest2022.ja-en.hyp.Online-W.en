I tried to buy the entry package and found a blue and an orange package.
The price is more than double for the orange one.
What is the difference?
I couldn't figure it out by looking it up, so please let me know.
There should only be blue ones now.
If there is, it might just be the old product that is still available.
They are both the same, just different in appearance.
Karate VS Jiu-Jitsu

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" an eight-point plan for Durandal's rejection by Talia?
Is the gene, because he and Talia broke up because they couldn't have children due to a genetic mismatch, so the gene is not so right?
I think the Destiny plan is to find out, so I think there is some taking it out on her.

Well, I guess it was good practice for me to call in English... but it's too hard to understand English on the phone.

It's stuff like that that makes me not want to watch TV anymore...
Or maybe it's just that the comedians have become too much for me. TV is full of comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were a lot of scenes where the staff was laughing in the background even when they were saying something not particularly funny.
It's not obviously a funny part, but it's creepy how the staff laughs at everything he says because he's a successful comedian.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it puts the comedian in a bad mood, and I guess it's not good for the business relationship.
Like the old black companies, the industry is very much like an athletic club, and some comedians' egos are so big that they usually behave in an unpleasant manner, and it would be hard to make a living otherwise.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians themselves who are always saying, "Don't underestimate comedians," as if they are exaggerating how hard their job is.
I know that the income is pretty low until you start to sell, but I don't want to be told at every turn that being a comedian is the pinnacle of the hardest job in the world.
It sounds like a glorification of your own career and a justification for the too-high status of funny comedians in the media and in society.
To be honest, the industry I work in has its share of hardships, but it seems like the things that touch the comedian world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry if I'm complaining too much.
I felt like I had to let it out like farts or else it wouldn't be good for me...

Ikemoto Brush Kogyo Mail Order
Assortment of hairbrushes!
Samples given to purchasers.
The product I ordered from Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale at a discount, received a wired version of that mouse, and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
I know this is more of a mail order problem than a home-built PC topic, but I'm not convinced by any means and this is a well-known case, so I'll write about it here.
It all started when I found an MSI wireless gaming mouse on sale for 3,280 yen (link to the fishtrap) at the Tsukumo NetShop's Tsukumo Day sale that started the previous Friday.
I also checked the page for the wired version, considering the possibility of a price mistake, and found that it was 5,071 yen (link to the fishtip), so I ordered it, thinking there was a possibility that it was not a mistake.
I got the order email normally and the next day I also got the shipment email.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history on My Page.
I assumed at this point that I would receive the wireless mouse I ordered, since there was no notification of a mistake or cancellation notice between the order and shipment.
Here comes the problem. A few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in the registration of the product.
According to that email.
* The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version.
* We've already shipped the wired mouse.
1. refuse to receive the product and cancel the whole order
2. return only the mouse for a refund
3. use the wired mouse as is
You can choose to deal with the following
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separated, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note say the wireless version, but they replaced it with the wired version and sent it to me without my permission.
Isn't it terrible that they sent me a different product than the one I bought without my consent, and now they want me to send it back if I want a refund?
Please lend me your wisdom because I want to hit them back, even if I accept the refund in the end.

Isolated twice... Typhoon and Heavy Rain Leak Only Bridge Leading to District, Residents Triple Stockpile of Food in Fukushima Prefecture's Yamatsuri Town (Fukushima TV)
Yoshiro Matsumoto lives in the Kochihara district of Yamatsumachi, Fukushima Prefecture.
The East Japan Typhoon of 2019 had a major impact on the lives of his three households of eight people.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first I was like, 'Seriously?
The only road leading to the Kojihara district, Kojihara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 11 households and 30 residents in the district isolated. The only road leading to the Kojihara district, Kojihara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon.
The residents, who were forced to cut off their water supply, had to use the JR railway bridge, which is normally closed to traffic, to carry necessary supplies.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Normally, I could drive to my yard, but when I got out of my car, I had to carry it in my hand or on my back and walk across the railway bridge to get here, so I felt the importance of transportation and the car. The temporary bridge, which was completed less than a month later, was washed away by heavy rains less than three months later, and the area was once again isolated for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
Although restoration has progressed more than two years after the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons he learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
We have about three times as many canned goods, cup noodles, and other foods that can be used as emergency rations as we had before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "I realized once again that it is not someone else's business, and that you never know when a disaster might befall you, so it is better to have a little stockpile or something in reserve.
On the other hand, Yamatsuri Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" in which a bridge was washed away.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Director of the Education Department of Yamatsuri Town: "We have announced that we would like to set October 12 as "Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day" to think about disaster preparedness from next year onward.
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected events has increased even more than before.
Article at the time of purchase
The test itself is almost finished, so all I have to do is write the text, but I am also doing a follow-up test to make sure the measurements are correct, so please wait a bit.
I understand that you are not confident about the measurement results.
Do you think Hanyu's ranking would have been different if the Olympics had not been held in China?

Olympic rinks have detailed regulations, even down to the lighting.
It is so that it will be the same no matter where you do it.

Each tablet displaying the virtual space was designed to allow participants to experience themselves as if they were running the marathon course and competing with other participants from Japan and abroad, as well as enjoying the sightseeing spots in Tokyo.
Participants ... "The scenery was very different and fun.
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government officials said, "We would like to make it available at gyms and other places in the future," and hope to have it installed by the beginning of the new year. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government hopes to have the game available at gyms and other facilities by the end of the new year.

What should we send to our foreign friends?

Be careful when buying an existing house!
The Pitfalls of the Building Condition Appraisal System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo!
The "Building Condition Appraisal" system, newly established to revitalize the used home market, has been enjoying brisk sales of used homes.
Prices of both houses and condominiums are rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.
While the Corona disaster has increased the preference for homeownership, the soaring prices of "in front of stations, near stations, directly connected to stations," "large scale," and "tower" properties have become popular, and the number of relatively inexpensive new properties has plummeted.
However, compared to other countries, Japan's share of the existing (pre-owned) housing market is still low.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Law and started building condition inspections, or so-called "inspections," for the purpose of safe and secure existing home transactions (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ) .
This is a system under which an architect familiar with the house checks the current condition of the property, including deterioration, and the condition of the building, compiles a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections benefits both buyers and sellers.
Sellers can avoid post-delivery complaints and give buyers a sense of security by conducting property inspections prior to sales transactions.
This, in turn, will lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, the system allows him or her to understand the condition of the existing house to be purchased and to make a purchase with full understanding of its condition.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in building condition inspections.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system is obligatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of brokering the property is obligated to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect to conduct a building condition inspection" or "we cannot", but the inspection itself is not obligatory.
On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in the U.S. and the U.K., where the used home market is booming.
In this system, buyers request building inspections by specialists called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" at the preliminary stage of a home sale or purchase.
In the U.S., for example, inspections are conducted in 70-90% of existing home transactions, depending on the state.
The nature of this system differs greatly from Japanese inspections, which are mainly conducted by sellers, in that the "buyer" takes the initiative in conducting the inspection.
The seller side tries to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and to sell it as quickly and at the highest price possible.
The buyer, on the other hand, wants to examine the inspection results, make appropriate repairs, and live in peace.
Even though the inspection is the same, there is a discrepancy between the two parties' objectives and thoughts.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-initiated inspections set by the government is minimal.
The inspection company is at risk of overlooking truly important defects because the inspection is not a detailed survey.
Therefore, there is a possibility that the inspection company will conduct "discovery" inspections, for example, by not reporting findings that are unfavorable to the seller.

Going above and beyond Ginza! Ginza's top-class restaurants!
First sneak visit to Kinza
When you walk around Ginza, you can still see traces of the history that the area has carved out, such as quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
Walking through Ginza with my girlfriend, I was unexpectedly visited by silence: "You know, this used to be a peninsula.
Ginza was once a peninsula?
Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, is synonymous with a downtown area that has spawned "XX Ginza" all over Japan.
To begin with, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612, the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was relocated to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shin-ryogae-cho," but when it moved to Kakigaracho, it came to be known as "Ginza.
By the way, Ginza used to be a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Prior to the Edo period (1603-1867), the area between Hibiya and Marunouchi was encircled by an inlet, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula is where Ginza is today.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and proceeded to develop the Kyobashi area.
Ieyasu also laid out the city blocks and built a moat around them to facilitate boat transportation.
He also reclaimed the inlet by cutting down the soil from the moat and cutting down Mount Kanda.
There is a stone monument in front of the Tiffany Ginza flagship store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo) that marks the site of the Ginza Yakusho (Ginza Office), so those who are interested can look for it.
A "pilgrimage to a sacred place" in Ginza for those in the know
Every year, Ginza hosts the Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour, a "pilgrimage to sacred sites" known only to those in the know.
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most visible is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theater.
Many people visit the shrine, which stands to the right of the Kabuki-za Theater, before or after seeing a play.
On the other hand, Ryuko-Fudo is located on the rooftop of the Ginza Matsuya Department Store, and Ginza Suisei-Jizoson is on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi's Ginza Terrace.
The Hodo Inari Shrine, Azuma Inari Shrine, and Toyoiwa Inari Shrine are located at the end of an alley and are less conspicuous, but Toyoiwa Inari Shrine is known to have been revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Hazaemon, and the Success Inari Shrine at the first floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed except during the Haccho Shrine Tour.
Although some of the shrines on the shrine tour are dedicated to Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, most of the shrines are dedicated to Inari.
Inari shrines, where a fox welcomes visitors in front of the shrine pavilion, were popular in areas where there were many farmers, as they were believed to be beneficial for a good harvest of rice.
In big cities such as Kyoto and Edo (Tokyo), the shrine was said to bring good fortune for prosperous business, and this belief spread to Ginza, Japan's largest shopping district.
What do you think of people who return home without getting vaccinated?
It would not be good.
There have been many cases of people being infected with the Omicron strain even after being vaccinated twice.
I would have to say it was a thoughtless action.

I went to the dentist's office two days ago because I had a pain in my front tooth and when I pushed or touched it, I had a nagging pain that felt like hypersensitivity.
The nerve was pulled and the hole was left open.
He said it was to make the pain go away faster.
The pain is more intense when I touch the tooth than before the treatment, but I wonder if it will go away in a few days...
Will it go away in a few days... Painkillers don't help at all...
It will calm down in a few days.
I think this is the most painful time.

Wanted How to compile scripts & how to modify scripts of existing mods
I've looked at a lot of things and tried hard, but I just don't know how to do it.
I want to start from MO2 (I don't want to move script sources or resources), so I've tried apps for that, but I don't know how to use the tools.
I've gone through the tutorials on the CKWiki, but all it says is how to make a mod completely on your own.
I just want to modify the script of an existing mod and recompile it... why can't I find a way to do that...

Were most of the soldiers during the Greater East Asia War national servicemen?
Not most, but all of them were what we now call national civil servants.
The military itself is a national organization, so even those who say they were drafted into the military are also national civil servants in the organizational sense.

South Korea's POSCO International to Acquire Australia's Cenex Energy, Expanding Overseas Gas Field Business (WoW! Korea)
POSCO International announced on April 12 that it has signed an agreement to acquire shares of Australia's Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
The acquisition is expected to be completed in March of next year, pending the approval of Senex Energy's shareholders at a general shareholders' meeting and the approval of the local subsidiary.
This acquisition is the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International will invest 50.1% and Hankook Energy will invest 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided on this acquisition based on its belief that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition and that in the hydrogen market, blue hydrogen based on natural gas will split the market along with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of natural gas consumption in South Korea in 2019, and local onshore gas field operations personnel in Australia.

Isn't it a little too much holiday?
Originally, February was only National Day, the 11th, but now the 23rd is a holiday because the current emperor was born in February.
But the previous emperor's birthday, December 23, became a weekday, so the number of days in the year remains the same.
That knee pain may be "osteoarthritis of the knee" ! ?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC ) - Yahoo!
Editor: I have been having knee pain lately.
What kind of disease could it be?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among these, osteoarthritis is the most common among Japanese people.
Editor: You mean that the joints become deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which softens impact and facilitates joint movement.
However, aging, obesity, and strenuous sports can cause the cartilage to wear away or become distorted.
This results in joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Can osteoarthritis occur in other areas besides the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
Besides the knees, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers of the hands, the neck, the lower back, the thumbs of the feet, and the hip joints.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee and is called "osteoarthritis of the knee.
Editor: To begin with, what is the structure of a joint?
Dr. Maruyama: A joint consists of two bones that are assembled unevenly.
The area where these two bones meet is covered with "articular cartilage," and the joint is surrounded by an "articular capsule.
Editor: It is a complex structure, isn't it?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes, it is.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
This is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee movement.
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly with each other.
It acts as a cushion, so to speak.
However, when it wears down or becomes distorted, it causes deformation and inflammation of the joints, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
Basically pajamas, but if my pajamas are in the wash or something, I sleep in a jersey or something!
Are there heavy smokers who can quit smoking, or are there those who can't?
Yes, there are two kinds.
A friend of mine was a heavy smoker, but he quit completely.
He said that he just felt like quitting for some reason, and then he just quit.

3 Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo!
The "Kaiji" series is a gambling manga series that has exploded in popularity, especially among men.
One of the best parts of the series is the extreme games in which players put their lives on the line.
The game is a game of life and death. ... Try your hand at crossing a steel frame!
So this time, we would like to examine the Kaiji games that can actually be played or have been practiced in the project videos.
Numa The trap-filled pachinko game "Numa" appeared in "Kaiji: The Gambling Diaries.
In the original story, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball astonished Kaiji.
The "swamp" is a huge trap with a "forest of nails," "movable balls," and a "three-tiered cloon," and it was considered almost impossible to overcome it.
However, Kaiji used all possible means and finally succeeded by placing a vinyl water tank on the building to make the ground sink and tilt.
The "swamp" that appeared in the Kaiji story actually appeared as a pachinko game, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball," and the difficulty level is lowered, but it is possible to experience the feeling of Kaiji.
The rich people held the "Starside Party" as an entertainment and had the debtors, including Kaiji, perform the "Human Horse Race" steel frame crossing.
Debtors compete for the fastest time by walking on a thin steel frame set up 10 meters above the ground while trying not to fall off.
Twelve people participate in the race, and the top two win cash prizes, but there are only four steel frames, and safety measures are inadequate, so the chances of death are quite high.
Although this steel frame crossing is highly dangerous, it was developed as a VR game and can be experienced very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
The Eagle Bridge is a 20-meter-high (equivalent to the seventh floor of a building) steel-frame bridge, beyond which are the "Sky Swing" and the "Victory Bridge," which visitors walk to.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi became the talk of the town when he released a video on his YouTube page showing him walking across the Eagle Bridge, claiming that he could experience steel frame crossing in Japan.
E-Card" is a card game in which two players play against each other.
The player is divided into two groups, one for the emperor, one for the citizens, and one for the slaves, using a total of 10 cards.
The game is very well designed, with the emperor being strong against the citizens, the citizens being strong against the slaves, and the slaves being strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, his ear will be cut off.
Kaiji struggled hard but eventually realized that his mind was being read by the ear-destroying device attached to his ear like an earphone that senses and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, etc. He confused Tonegawa by cutting off his own ear to the utmost limit and making his body abnormal, and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other retailers.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him and Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played Kaiji in the movie, playing with the E-card, which attracted a lot of attention.
■Could you try to feel like Kaiji?
No one wants to be in the same situation as Kaiji, but if you read the manga, you can get a taste of what it feels like.
Why don't you try to feel the world view through the game?
Gently Encouraging Steps toward the New Year: Large Tiger Ema at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine｜Yamagata Shimbun
A large ema (votive tablet) depicting the Chinese zodiac sign for the coming year, "Tiger," has appeared at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway.
The students of Tohoku University of Art & Design, who designed the ema, visited the shrine on November 11, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has commissioned Geijutsu Institute of Technology students to draw the original picture for the ema since the year before last.
This year, Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was chosen from among nine drawings by students in the Japanese painting course of the art department under the guidance of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high at the center.
Tsuchiya said that she drew the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing her back as she steps out into the new year.
The tiger standing still and gazing at the cherry blossoms expresses Tsuchiya's wish that people will have time to appreciate the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world.
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on ema (votive tablet) distributed to the general public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, a Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people to overcome difficulties.

Let's think about "Tamano, where we want to continue to live." Workshop for students of four high schools in the city to make proposals.
What kind of town will Tamano be like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano are working together in a workshop to think about "the kind of Tamano we want to live in.
This is part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center, an intermediary support organization, which compiles the real voices of young people and makes proposals to the mayor.
The workshop will be held in the city of Tamano, Japan. What is fun?
The facilitator asked the students, to which they responded, "When I get excited with many people," "When I play the drums," and so on.
The first meeting was held on November 13 at Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
Eighteen high school students and local residents discussed "interesting towns," "towns that are easy to live in," and "towns that make life worth living" using the "World Café" method, in which participants move from one "island" to another, each with a specific theme.
Each idea was written on a sticky note and pasted on a piece of paper.
They discussed the following points: "Towns with many young people seem interesting," and "Traffic such as trains and buses is essential for livability.
They discussed further to see if there were any commonalities.
I thought Tamano was boring, but cycling along the seaside is appealing," said a junior at Tamano Commerce and Industry High School (18).
A third-year student at Binan High School (18) said, "There are few stores and the traffic is inconvenient, but the rich nature is nice.
At the second meeting in December, the high school students will meet alone to organize the details of their proposals.
They plan to make a presentation in February of next year, inviting the mayor and the superintendent of education.
Rie Higashi, the center's chairperson, says, "We hope that this will nurture the high school students' love for their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to become proactively involved in community development.

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
Stole is indispensable in winter, but do you sometimes find that the cloth is sometimes a little too loose around your neck?
It is a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after wrapping the stole, but we often hear people say that they don't quite know how to do it.
If only there was a stole that could be wrapped quickly and easily without the fabric becoming loose... I was wondering if there was a scarf that I could wrap quickly and easily without the fabric becoming loose, and then I found something innovative.
The brand "COTTORI" has a scarf with a length of about 1 meter, which is longer than most scarves. It is more compact than most scarves.
When I first saw it, I wondered if it was possible to wrap it around something so short. I wondered.
Upon closer inspection, one can see that it is made by weaving a narrow piece of cut cloth into a single piece, and the entire piece is made into a mesh.
The ends of the stole can be threaded through the mesh.
The ends of the stole can be rolled up and fastened without having to tie the ends together.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular even for jackets, and many people will wear them in combination with a stole to keep their shoulders cool.
I am sure that having such a stole will come in handy.

The Beatles documentary at Disney Plus is super interesting!
It's called "Get Buck" and it was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's very fresh and raw, like a life-sized version of the Beatles. ......
It's not as dramatic as I had imagined.
It's not the dramatic awkwardness that I had imagined. I know I'm annoying, but come on!" while trying his best to lead the group, George who is a bit lazy, John who is late all the time and seems unmotivated while calmly expressing his opinions and jokes, and Ringo who plays the role of ...... calming them down and not actively interrupting, sitting in the back with a "I'm stuck! I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a little bit of a fight.
They didn't hate each other to the point of fighting, but there was a certain atmosphere of "well, we can't work together anymore," and it's interesting to see that the Beatles were like that, too.
And even in that atmosphere, when they started to play, they were all so talented.
They started playing little phrases, and then they started saying to each other, "How about this? And the process of making the song into a masterpiece was amazing!
Especially the moment when the title song "Get Buck" is completed is amazing!
It's amazing how the casual humming of the song gradually turned into the "zucha zucha zucha" and the lyrics were recorded!
It's not often that you get to see the songwriting process like this, so it's amazing!
And of course, just watching the performance scene makes me happy because they are all so full of energy!
I know this is only the first of three episodes, but my impression so far is that the biggest cause of the breakup was the environment around the Beatles rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them complain about everything, but once they start writing songs, they seem to be having a good time. But when it came to the question of where to play, the producers and publicists would say, "Well, the Beatles are the best in the world! It was easy to see that the Beatles had already left their own hands.
Well, documentaries are also subject to the director's interpretation, so maybe that's how Peter Jackson felt about it. ......
Also, I heard that Paul is supervising the film, so maybe that's why he seems to be the bad guy in a lot of scenes.

I think that because you have a serious character, you feel a sense of responsibility, and you are losing your mind.
I think it's a little hard to live now, isn't it?
I was a salesman, but I changed jobs after I became deathly ill. At that time, I was not good at making sales activities, but I thought I was very suited to sales activities where customers needed me, so I chose such a job in a different industry and found it much easier to work.
If you can find something you are good at or something you can do, I think it will make your life a little easier in the future.
←Of course, you can think about this only after you have had a good rest and have some peace of mind.
However, you will also have to deal with your daily life, so it would be a good idea to consult with your company's union, an industrial physician, or a consultation service, if available.
I hope you will be able to live your life with a little more ease in the future.

Many tornadoes and heavy damage in the U.S. Unseasonably warm weather and strong cold air (Weather News)
Tornadoes were frequently reported in the southern United States from Friday night to Saturday, September 10-11 (local time).
It is believed that strong cold air moving south of the record warm temperatures of this time of year caused extremely unstable atmospheric conditions and rapidly developed cumulonimbus clouds.
Warm air flowed into the southern U.S. from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the high temperatures on Thursday and Friday reached nearly 30°C (86°F).
In the midst of this record-breaking warmth, strong cold air of -30°C or lower moved southward at around 5,500 m above the ground, forming an active front due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes are believed to have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States has always been prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The number of tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150, a record number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and wind gusts on Friday the 10th local time alone.
This shows that there are two major areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line that includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third strongest of six on the EF scale (modified Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, and is believed to have had instantaneous wind gusts of around 70 m/s.
Depending on future investigations, it may be determined to be an EF 4 or 5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Modified Fujita Scale and adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
A JEF 3, which is equivalent to the tornado that hit the U.S. this time, has a good chance of occurring in Japan, and is at a level that could collapse a wooden house.

Tornadoes in U.S. "Largest in History" Live Broadcast from Under the Rubble, Calls for Help (Nikkan Sports)
On March 11 (Japan time), U.S. President Joe Biden described the damage caused by tornadoes in the Midwest and South as "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history," according to a mysterious look on his face.
CNN and other media reported the news.
Biden stressed that "the federal government will do everything it can.
We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he explained.
The death toll is feared to exceed 100.
Photo: Residents in tornado-devastated Kentucky carry household goods out of their damaged homes From the night of October 10 to early morning of November 11, more than 30 tornadoes were reported in at least six states, including Kentucky.
The largest recorded tornado in the area of damage was the 219 miles (350 km) that devastated Missouri and other states in 1925, but CNN's weather experts estimated that this was the largest tornado, at approximately 250 miles (400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, the hardest-hit area, a candle factory that was operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of them left.
In the darkness, a woman stuck under about 1.5 meters of thick debris felt the weight of rescue workers searching over the rubble and called for help via a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
The live broadcast, which was made public, included a woman's cries for help, as well as screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which another woman is believed to have sung while crying to drown her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son when a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
She recalled, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more of an earth-shaking, terrifying sound, like something spewing."
A Mayfield police officer said, "Search efforts will continue until there is no longer a need for them.
I don't know if it will be weeks, months, or years.
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead when an Amazon warehouse partially collapsed.
Train cars were derailed with such force that they were cut off, and highways were also closed one after another due to vehicle overturns.
According to US web media, a total of about 400,000 homes are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.
I have low platelets.
What should I do to increase them?

It's tough when you can't afford welfare...
Fingers crossed that you can manage.
If there was a "live-in job" like an inn or resort job, it would be nice to have both an address and a source of income, but with the current social situation of the Corona disaster, there don't seem to be many options...
I found this site on the web.
Live-in part-time/full-time jobs - Live-in Job Navi (Suminavi)
There is a related search for "live-in jobs with a reason", so many of my co-workers seem to be like that.
I feel like I can get by with a bank account or line contract if I have an address for the first time, but I can't renew a credit card (and a debit card that can be treated as a credit card) without an address (since the new card is sent to the registered address).

There is an old saying that there are different ways of thinking about the star rating system.
While other countries use 5 stars as a standard from which points are deducted, Japan uses 3 stars as a neutral point system, and points are added or deducted from it.
There is already a difference of two stars at the standard score, and four stars has a completely different meaning between "there is an element of point deduction" and "it is not a masterpiece, but an honorable mention.
If 5 stars are used as the standard, "a work with no flaws" and "a work of the highest standard in everything" would be in the same category, and if there is such a tendency, it would be a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of stars, but that is how the system is currently operated. So you are asking me not to give it 3 stars (bad review).
So if you try to argue with people who insist on this kind of discourse with Steam's two choice rating, you're going to lose the conversation.

Is there a submersible pump that can be plugged into a standard hose size and powered by USB?
The capacity of power that can be taken from USB is roughly up to 2A at 5V, so only a mere 10W.
A submersible pump consumes at least 500W, depending on the product, so it is impossible.

Home-built radio volume
I made an am radio with a homemade capacitor and coil, but it was noisy and I couldn't hear clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was not at the frequency I had tuned it to.
It's possible that I wasn't tuning it right and didn't hear it properly, but it wasn't the station I assumed it would be...

Fried seasonal fish caught in coastal waters and fried prawns with homemade tartar sauce
Hakobune" is a takeout store specializing in colorful bento boxes and deli dishes (side dishes) using plenty of vegetables. Hakobune" is a takeout shop specializing in colorful bento and deli (side dishes) made with vegetables.
Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Arimi Kazuki (38) opened the shop in August last year, hoping to offer a restaurant-like atmosphere in their own home.
One of the popular bento dishes is "Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp caught in the surrounding seas with homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
The fish is selected at the market from the best fish of the season.
Takayuki says, "I use the thinnest possible layer of fresh breadcrumbs on the fried fish so that the texture of the ingredients can be appreciated," and the shrimp fries are a direct result of their crispy texture.
The bento comes with four kinds of vegetables and deli items, rice made from Hinohikari rice produced in Saga Prefecture and containing minor grains, and soup.
Vegetables are home-grown in a field near the restaurant or purchased at a direct sales market in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki, who is trained as a French chef, adds color with items such as rapée and ratatouille.
On the other hand, Aromi hopes to create "familiar and comforting flavors" such as dashimaki tamago (rolled egg), and has created a blend of Japanese and Western dishes that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
The bento boxed lunch "hand-kneaded hamburger steak made with Japanese mutton and pork" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, they will also sell "charcuterie sets," processed meat products that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and saw something that looked interesting, so I tried it out!
Ride Comfort Not that bad, but sometimes bumpy (not enough to get you drunk)
Speed: Naturally slow.
Safety I think it is safe because it slowed down and in some cases stopped completely when there were people around, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
People look at me, which is fine, but they look at me like I'm in their way, which hurts my heart.
Overall comment It wasn't bad but there was still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it would be easier to use if it were a little less crowded or if people were asked to move closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be better if they made a dedicated lane or something so that people don't get in the way of other people walking around.
However, I thought it would be a nice ride if there were a few less people because it was also relaxing and you could take your time while taking in the scenery!
It was a ride that would be difficult unless you have a very patient heart, and the excitement from the feeling of the near future that this kind of automatic driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the surrounding eyes was pleasant.
It was so embarrassing!

A Family's Long Road to Environmental Protection Taking Root in China's Frontier (JBpress)
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant, Find Asia, a Hong Kong-based company) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity: it has the world's largest variety of mammals and the third largest variety of plants.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists as well as environmental protection conducted by local governments.
Sisapanna (Xishuangbanna) in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such region.
The area borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities including the "傣" who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through many countries in Southeast Asia, flows through this area.
Xishuangbanna 傣族 Autonomous Prefecture The area of Xishuangbanna is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of all types of wild animals and 20% of all types of plants.
This time, we met Ms. Min Guo Li, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and she told us about her activities there.
You and your German husband started environmental protection activities together - - I heard that you have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
How did it all start?
Ms. Li Our environmental protection activity "Tianxue" started in 2000.
It all started with my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China scientific project.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted one of the greatest biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
This led to large-scale logging of the rainforest in order to establish industry in the area and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to help restore the natural resources and study the biological resources.
Then he met and married me, who was a reporter here.
-Before that, did you have any interest in conservation?
Mrs. Lee: I am from Sisapanna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
So without that knowledge, my husband and I decided to promote the project.
Why do you think it is that you sometimes see people who are not well-faceted or particularly tall, but have an aura about them?
A popular actor once told me.
Aura is not something that comes out when you want it to.
It comes out naturally the moment you have confidence in yourself. He said.
I am sure that person has a strong inner confidence.
High-function, high-quality rubber boots are handmade by craftsmen.

I suddenly think, is it fine to compliment someone's clothes or say you like their color?
It's not very detailed, is it?
It's something you can see.
I don't think it's very detailed.
I've never had someone call my compliments detailed, so I'm not sure what they mean.
I don't know what they mean by "fine".
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
I would reply, "Sakura-san confessed to me, my heart is in full bloom in spring, and I would like to go out with you.
And to go out, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what we both like to do.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to?
The procedure will be completed faster if you open them at the same time.
Right now, it takes about a week to complete the process.
You will not be charged any fees, so we recommend you to open your NISA account at the same time so that you can use it as soon as you want to use it.

The one that was the cause of CTD in MOD's own environment and took about 1.5 months to identify.
The data was stable until March, but since around GW, CTDs caused by multiple factors have been occurring while not having much time to play, and it took a very long time to identify them as I investigated little by little only on my days off.
Why didn't we use the .Net Script Framework to analyze the logs (we would have known in a few minutes)? Some of the errors in the .dll family and mesh-related errors don't stay in the crash log.
0 Main CTD timings.
* All Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and logging type .dll plug-ins leave no footprint in the log.
* When some NPCs are killed/accumulated attacks: triggered even by console kill -> improved by turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree Mr. SE update resumed version) * Possibility of wetting the pants on this?
* When camera work triggers a kill move against some NPCs → Basic improvement by turning off the kill move setting by PC via .ini: Conflict of settings related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic outdoor) When moving in the field + activating some magic (e.g. Freezing Runes) and hitting NPCs: All settings for NPCs using SPID in Dirt & Blood v 2.0 (upper right corner of MCM) are OFF and all improved after 5 consecutive tries.
This may be due to a shader setting error in the additional armor and body mesh worn by some actors/ NPCs. The SPID usage default.ini of 2.0 has a formatting error, but the result should be the intended result and the prerequisite perk should be applied to the NPCs.
I initially focused my checks around wetting the site attacks and OnHit related motion/combat mods (.dll's), but I got results like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German or French level.
I thought it might be helpful as a reminder in case anyone else is having similar CTD problems in a Japanese environment.
We are all rather on the edge of our mentality.
People around us don't notice it, even family members, let alone co-workers.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically about how well he is doing his job, even though he seems to be having a hard time.
But perhaps he, too, is on the edge of mental health.
Although I have not resigned in the name of mental health, I think I was at my limit just before I resigned.
Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Home Nursing Care - After Today's Home Nursing Care
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, and I have known the nurse (a woman) at the home nursing station I am using now for a long time, and I think we have a very good relationship.
We talk about many things every week.
Of course, she does what is necessary to manage my medication (such as packaging it in one package), but above all, today's home nursing made me realize how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, we had a chat about gender differences between men and women, or rather, we discussed gender theory.
We talk about the sexual desires of men and women, why my girlfriend divorced me, and other things that are not really appropriate for home nursing. I sometimes talk about such things as "Is it OK to talk about such things in home nursing?
Sometimes I even dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from an acquaintance that in the case of a home nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, an old lady nurse who is no longer able to work in the ward comes and does nothing but provide clerical support, or that an occupational therapist comes and gives instructions in a superior manner, saying "We are in charge of medical care" when a home care nurse is there. I have heard from an acquaintance of mine that the social welfare corporation I use is one of the most important ones.
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are really good nurses who are frank with me, as an equal, as I have a mental illness.
By the way, she is a beautiful woman.
I know that some of you are receiving psychiatric home care nursing or are thinking about receiving it.
Home health care nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, by all means, take it.
And choose a good home health care agency.
I once had a place that I just couldn't agree with, so I terminated my contract with them.
Sorry for the rambling.
I know it's a false warning, but it came out in English and scared me.
Why is it in English?
There are several things that could be causing this, for example...
The person who made the page does not know what it is displayed as in Japanese.
A language judgment glitch.
The browser setting is set to give priority to English.
The ranking of the number of lotto 6 draws in order of least number of occurrences is all odd numbers.
Why is it so hard to find odd numbers?
I wonder.
There is some kind of apparent pattern.
It can be repetitive, or it can continue.
I am now teleworking due to the Corona disaster.
But at home I can't concentrate on my work.
I get soppy and touch my cell phone immediately.

The number of patents for hydrogen technology in South Korea is one-fifth of China's ... South Korea's Hydrogen Economy Roadmap Delayed (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese Edition) - Yahoo!
The Korean government has announced a hydrogen economy roadmap for 2019.
It aims to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022. The roadmap called for the diffusion of 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative total) and the operation of 310 hydrogen stations nationwide by 2022.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilometer.
However, as of November of this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target level (approximately 17,700 The schedule for the deployment of hydrogen stations, the core infrastructure, is as follows.
The hydrogen station diffusion schedule for the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 stations), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is not much different from the price at the time the roadmap was announced. The price of hydrogen per kilometer is not much different from the price at the time of the roadmap announcement, at 8,400 won.
The government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap has fallen far short of the target.
The Federation of Korean Industries (JEMAI) released the report "Current Status of Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem and Policy Direction" on March 12.
According to the report, the hydrogen industry's core components and materials are mostly dependent on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (US), Gore (US), 3M (US), etc. supply membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) is increasing at an average annual rate of 14% (201 Since 2004).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-202 Korea ranks 5th in the world in the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total for 2014-2020).
However, the Federation of Korean Industries and Businesses said, "In effect, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, meaning that Korea actually ranks lower among competing countries.
The ranking of patents by country is China, the U.S., the EU, and Japan, in that order.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the U.S. to become No. 1, and has since widened the gap.
In terms of the number of patents registered in 2020, South Korea (1,033) surpassed Japan (974) to take fourth place. (974), but is 22% of China's (4,721). However, this is 22% of the number of patents registered in China (4,721).
The Federation of Korean Industries proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax credit for capital investment and R&D expenses.

Except for the daily payment, you probably need an address to get a hard time.

Furthermore, line contract requires an address.
So don't lose your phone contract...

Don't forget that securing an address is a top priority.

Congress on Sunday?
Takasu Town Council reform is underway, including a "report card" of council members：Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin E-ban
Takasu, Hokkaido: The Takasu Town Council has been working on unique council reforms, including the creation of a novel flyer announcing regular council meetings and the introduction of a "correspondence book" in which council members are evaluated by the town's residents.
The town council has not been elected for three consecutive terms, and the council is aiming to get residents to take an interest in the town council.
To publicize the Sunday assembly meeting to be held on January 12, approximately 1,800 copies of a new flyer were inserted into newspapers on January 9.
The new flyers include "Asa kara Ikkyu Giron," "Tetsuko's Room," "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Tanken Series," .... ...
The flyers, distributed by the town council to all the households on January 9, were filled with phrases reminiscent of the names of popular TV programs.
Councilor Hyoe Katayama, 43, who created the leaflet, says, "I hope people will smile and visit the council.

U.S., aid arms and ammunition arrive in Ukraine for troop training (CNN.co.uk)
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden by 12 The military aid totaled $60 million.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (about 6.8 billion yen). The last of the equipment, including four radars to identify the firing points of mortars and other weapons, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the new year.
According to Pentagon spokesman Kirby, these aids also included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The military assistance is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military buildup of forces near the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. is becoming increasingly alarmed by Russian military moves and is consulting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to formulate countermeasures in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved the weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the U.S. White House on September 1 of this year.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine this year amounted to about $450 million.
Total aid since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula has amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
U.S. forces are also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian troops.
Last month, the U.S. sent the U.S. Florida National Guard in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan in support of Ukraine.
U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. Special Operations forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed due to operational sensitivities.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 7 this month, and they exchanged some tense exchanges on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The "Review" of Inheritance and Gift Taxes that "Prohibits" Giving Gifts During One's Lifetime, Interview with Akira Amari, Former Chairman of the Tax Commission of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" features the following article: "Talking with Your Family During the New Year's Eve and New Year's Holidays!
How to make a gift before death and rush into inheritance".
While the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax is under discussion, there is a great possibility that the royal road to inheritance tax prevention, gift-giving during one's lifetime, will become "prohibited" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In this article, we will directly interview Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission and a member of the House of Representatives, and teach you everything from the basics of gifting and inheritance to tax-saving techniques to make the most of your gifts before the end of the year.
(Hiroaki Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
The ruling party announced last year that it would "move forward with a full-fledged study to establish a tax system that is neutral to the timing of asset transfers from the perspective of taxing inheritance and gift taxes in a more integrated manner.
This sentence in the tax reform proposal for fiscal 2021 announced by the ruling party last year caused a great deal of consternation not only among wealthy individuals but also among the middle class.
This is because the ruling party's intention is to drastically change the rules of inheritance taxation and to prohibit "gifts during one's lifetime," the most popular method of inheritance tax prevention, in order to raise the inheritance tax rate dramatically.
The ironclad rule for saving against inheritance tax, which is highly progressive, is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation.
Living wills, the most powerful trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy individuals, but also by corporate employees whose homes in the three major metropolitan areas are subject to inheritance tax, albeit in small amounts.
It was against this backdrop that the debate over the "unification of inheritance and gift taxes" came to a head.
Although it was not included in the 2010 Tax Reform Proposal announced on December 10, 2010, which was expected to be the fastest introduction of the new tax system, the current inheritance tax system and calendar year gift tax system are to be reviewed, and the gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within a limited amount. The policy toward unification was reiterated with more detailed statements such as, "The gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount," etc.
In an interview with this editorial, former LDP Secretary General Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP's tax policy research committee, said, "The timing of the transfer of assets may affect the advantage or disadvantage of the transfer.
The most important thing is to eliminate the advantage or disadvantage depending on the timing of the transfer of assets, and to make the tax burden the same no matter when the transfer is made.
If the amendment is made as quickly as possible, there will be only three remaining opportunities to make gifts during one's lifetime.
Even if this is not the case, it seems certain that in the near future the government will take a major step in the direction of disallowing gifts made before death as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly will the estate and gift tax rules change?

My Righteous Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial wave from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa: "Stay tuned! "
The FOD original drama "My Righteous Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will air on Fuji Television Network from January 10, 2022 on terrestrial wave.
This drama is based on the manga of the same title by Satoshi Morie, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, and is a pure love story about a man and woman who have carried their pasts with them.
Furukawa plays the main character, Kairi, and Hanazumi Yamatani plays the heroine, Riyo.
Riyo is a university student who meets Kairi, a senior student at her part-time job.
He is a mysterious young man who suffers from insomnia every day, but for some reason is able to sleep soundly when he is on Riyo's shoulders.
Riyo is attracted to him because of his resemblance to her brother, who was separated from her after their parents' divorce, but one day she begins to wonder if he might be a murderer.
Yudai Furukawa comments "My Righteous Brother" will start airing on terrestrial TV on January 10!
For those who have already seen the drama, I hope you will learn more about the complicated psychology of Kairi and Riyo and the conflicts and changes they go through after seeing the development of the story.
We hope that fans of the original work will also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

NFL] The team that won with three passes in one game What and how the players felt (BBM Sports) - Yahoo!
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in the game.
This was the fewest number of passes in the NFL in the past 50 years, since the Bills recorded two in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
The 1974 Bills had an unheralded genius RB in O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season the previous season for the first time ever.
The Bills dominated the Jets on the run with Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The main reason the Patriots ran such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, not unlike Kushiro in Hokkaido, Japan, in terms of latitude.
And on this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius and the wind was blowing 18 mph, and it was snowing before the game.
The Bills did not change their play selection much, as they were only local.
They had 25 runs compared to 30 passes.
Allen was 15/30 passing for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, and it was by no means a poor performance.
There were scoring opportunities, with four red zone penetrations in 10 offensive series.
Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, they made it to the red zone 3 times in a row.
However, they were only able to score 3 points on 1 FG in those 3 attempts.
The defense in front of the goal in the final minutes of the game.
The Bills, trailing by 4 points, committed a penalty on 3rd&9, and it was 3rd&14.
They were 18 yards from the goal.
On 3rd&14, QB Allen was surrounded by a rush by the Patriots defense and drifted right out of the pocket.
He then threw a pass aimed at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but missed.
On the play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was outside to the right, ran sharrow-across to free himself in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.
On 4th&18, Allen tried to get WR Gabriel Davis running from outside left into the end zone, but the pass was beaten in front of him by Patriots DB Myles Bryant and failed.
Bryant was man-to-man coverage on Bills WR Cole Beasley, but saw Allen's move on the way out, released Beasley, and reacted to the pass.
Allen, who missed the two receivers, threw a pass both times, both times aimed at the end zone.
The 4th down pass may have been decisive, but on 3rd down, there was no need to go for the TD.
You only need two plays to get a first down.
Since it was still before 2 minutes, a 4th and short would have made use of Allen's ability to have his own run.
A cohesive, shiny hair.

3 items that tend to sit in the kitchen for long periods of time that it's time to toss and replace (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo!
Sponge
No matter how often you change them, you probably don't replace them as often as recommended.
A 2017 study shows that kitchen sponges can harbor a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized daily in the microwave (but it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave ) .
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend changing sponges once a week to keep them clean.
Cutting Boards
The United States Department of Agriculture notes that cutting boards should be replaced when they begin to wear out and develop scratches or grooves.
Once scratches and gouges develop, they are more difficult to keep clean and can harbor bacteria.
If it is still okay, remember to disinfect frequently with a solution of a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in a gallon of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and allow to dry naturally or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken dishes
It may be heartbreaking to get rid of a favorite mug, but a chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
Besides, chipped surfaces can cause cut lips and spilled drinks.
Yep, time to buy a new, favorite mug!

Community market and trade are two different things.
The community market uses steam's payment system.
>Because this feature allows you to make cash transactions with strangers, some people have been victims of scams where they don't get paid and only their items are taken.
This does not happen.
Trade is a function that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, not buy and sell.
Are you talking about a different occupation and employment status?
I rather don't understand why you think they are the same story.
Even simple labor may be full-time, and even intellectual labor may be informal.
FlashBIOS won't finish help.
I got a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced it with a B550 and tomahawk I had bought in September.
Once I got to the BIOS setup screen, but when I saved the settings and rebooted, I got a black screen with a white cursor-like dot on it that didn't flash and kept on accepting.
I thought the BIOS was corrupted, so I tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it takes about 5 minutes to finish, but even 1 hour is not enough.
The possible causes are that the USB flash drive I tried is too old, or that I used a SD card converter, or that I've been sleeping too long and my phone has been damaged.
Or the phone is damaged because it's been laid down for too long.
Is there any other possible cause?

For some reason, I am embarrassed to own brand-name products.
I can carry a brand name product as long as it is inconspicuous, but I can't carry something like a Vuitton with a big monogram that says "LV" on it.
Why is this?
I think it is better to have a brand that fits your size.
By the way, if it is in Japan, I think it is fine.
If it's in Japan, it's.... I think it's a good idea.
It doesn't matter if it's Gaijin style or not.
You should say early on, "Why do you call me off/tame-mouth only me?" and "Why do you call me by my first name only?
If they start saying, "Well, you're a gaijin, so it doesn't matter, does it? If you start to hear "It doesn't matter because I'm a gaijin," you should simply tell them that you are uncomfortable.
I think there's a decent chance that they don't even dream of being offended.
I lived abroad for a while, and there were many Japanese, including myself, who came here because they didn't like the Confucian traditions of the upper and lower classes, and they were either unhinged or mistakenly thought they could say anything to the locals.
If they look like Westerners, I think they are doing so out of a kind of naivete or open-mindedness, without any malice.
I sometimes have a hard time deciding which one to use when I speak Japanese to my friends.
It's okay if they are my friends.
I think they are just doing it as a normal thing, but if you ignore it, you might not be able to stop being treated as an exception because you are a gaijin, so you should tell them while you can.
It's like saying, "This is Japan, so can you please talk to me according to Japanese rules?
Edit: Not that it matters, but my Caucasian friend who is naturalizing always raises his glass higher than other younger people when toasting at a drinking party.
I think it's a good custom, because when you do that, you don't get taken advantage of by younger and older people, and they treat you like a Japanese.
Japanese people, regardless of their personalities, are fucking detail-oriented people (including me), so I think it's a good habit.

I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge only by the translated text.
I think the translated text is at a level where I feel a little uncomfortable with the text, but I can understand what you want to convey and it does not interfere with playing the game (I just feel this way, you should ask other people).
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, I feel that it is well translated.
I think it is not possible for someone who is not a native Japanese speaker to reach this level of understanding of the fine nuances of Japanese, even if they study for a long time.
I do not know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people do not feel uncomfortable with, it would be better to find someone else.

Consider "Oni-no-Kiri": Training is the battle.
The "Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a hymn to humanity <Memorizing the start of the "Yuukaku-hen" anime> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo!
What makes "Blade of the Oni no Shonen" particularly unique among recent shonen manga is the "excessive amount of training.
It is a common belief that training sessions, which usually do not involve battles, are not popular among readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in "One Piece," another Jump manga, when the Straw Hat gang was separated from the rest of the gang, there was a two-year training period, but the rest of the story was skipped over in a hurry.
Well, one of the charms of Onimune is the eccentricity of the lands he travels through, and "training in the same place" may not be a good match for him.
In "Blade of Demon's Destruction," Sumijiro, the protagonist of the story, gets down on his knees to Tomioka Yoshiyuu, who saved his life, and begs for the life of Priestess Nezuko, who tried to take his life, and is told, "Don't let others take your life! ! When he got down on his knees and begged for Priestess' life, who tried to take his life, he was told by Yoshiyuu, "Don't let anyone else take your life!
The weak have no rights and no choices, but are always twisted by the strong... ... ... .......
Having said that, Giyu kindly introduced Sakonji Rinkutaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Onikagitai (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
When Sumijiro's first contact with Rinkutaki was when he was asked what he would do if his sister ate a man, Sumijiro was at a loss for an answer and hit him with a hand, telling him that he was too slow in making a decision.
This is a seemingly unreasonable exchange that is well known among fans.
However, the possibility exists that he may be forced to make such a decision at some point in his life if he carries around his sister who has turned into a demon.
It is an initiation into training in order to be prepared for such a moment.
However, Rinkutaki takes Sumijiro, a novice who has yet to train, to Mount Sagiri and tells him to get down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is full of traps such as pitfalls and stone throwers in addition to the thin air, and Sumijiro is likely to die before he can begin his training.
Even so, he uses his keen sense of smell to sniff out the faint scent of traps set by human hands and somehow manages to avoid them, which is barely a "hero's compensation".
Still, "That doesn't mean that my physical ability suddenly becomes so high that I can avoid all of them, though! ! But that is the essence of what makes Onimasu Onimasu.
Ordinary people do not suddenly become strong without any proof, and when they awaken, it is only to be able to use "the power and techniques they have honed up to that point" at their true potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who make effort in proportion to their effort and rewards nothing for effort that has not been made, is an anthem for human beings, different from demons that have supernatural powers without any evidence, and is a rule that is consistent throughout this work.
Is this old?
Still, I sleep on a mat, mattress, and comforter directly in the house, not in a bed.
Since the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Am I being too hard on myself?
Are people who work part time and want to work full time, and work with other restaurants, are they picky?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, I don't think they are what I would call "greedy.
I think of "greedy" as someone who is scheming to get more profit with less effort than he/she is putting in.

Samsung Electronics Korea to Create "DX Division" Integrating Consumer Electronics and Mobile Devices, "Emphasizing User Experience" (WoW! Korea)
Following the merger of its CE and IM divisions into a single unit, Samsung Electronics announced on March 12 that it has decided on the name DX (Device eXperience), which will be reflected in its year-end reorganization.
The company's aim is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to consumer electronics.
Samsung Electronics announced that the DX division, which was newly established by integrating the CE and IM divisions, will consist of business units such as VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network.
A Samsung Electronics official explained, "The name change reflects our mid- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership.
He also added that the new name emphasizes the company's intention to enable consumers to easily enjoy optimized experiences through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and telecommunication equipment, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.

The company is currently envisioning a strategy to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Does 1500BCE mean BC?
How would you put it in Japanese?
It means 1500 BC.
BC means Before Christ, but we have been thinking that there should be consideration for non-Christians. However, in recent years, the term BCE has been used more and more, based on the idea that non-Christians should be taken into consideration.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

This is a bit unnatural.

I think that should be the case.
What I am wondering is.
* Whether you referenced other documentaries or not.
* Are we looking at it from an ant's point of view?
I am wondering if you are referring to other documentaries or not.
If you translate "armoured heads" as "disk-shaped heads," I think you'll lose the part about "in the scale of ants, they are giant beasts wearing helmets..."...
24-car collision in Aichi Prefecture: Trailer driver has no pre-existing medical condition, but may have been careless (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo!
The driver of the trailer that was arrested and sent to prosecution for the 24-vehicle collision in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, does not have a pre-existing medical condition and is believed to have caused the accident through inattention of some sort.
On the morning of January 10, 24 trucks, passenger cars, and other vehicles collided on Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people sustained minor injuries.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, 54, the driver of the trailer, on suspicion of causing the first rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the police on the morning of January 12.
Nomura's trailer continued to move forward without braking after the accident, and firefighters confirmed that Nomura had temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura does not have any pre-existing medical conditions, and it is believed that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
The police raided the related premises and are investigating the situation in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Vol. 4] (Shukupre NEWS)
The 20th Choujin Olympics, which started with volume 3, is now complete with this volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted the entire Olympics from the opening to the semi-finals in one fell swoop, this volume focuses on just one match, and as a result, it is full of new tricks!
Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewed by Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●Chonin wrestling has already started before the matches!
In a nutshell, this volume 4 is a slow and careful depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to keep in mind is that this is by no means a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, there is a lot of tension in the book, such as the mutual check-and-control battle and the training scene, but it is never boring.
The tension that gradually builds as the match of the century is about to begin is surely linked to the reader's growing tension, and even this period of time is a well-calculated performance that is truly admirable.
And before the important final, there is one more match that cannot be missed: the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Aside from the gorgeousness of the match-up card, my favorite part of the match was Ramenman's pre-match speech backstage, in which he said to a Kinnikuman poster, "It's my turn to take the prize! I'm going to get it! !
and tries to slap him with a chop.
But Terryman happens to be passing by and catches his hand and stops him, and they glare at each other silently and part ways with nothing more than that.
What's amazing about this is that both have already lost and have no more chance to fight Kinnikuman within this tournament.
But there is such an agonizing dispute over Kinnikuman.
When you see something like this, you can't help but think about his future career!
As a manga artist myself, I am still painfully aware that this is what it means to have a strong character!
The fight between the two ends without much time, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful plea after the match.
But the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful appeal to Kinnikuman after the fight, "Don't rely on the luck of the gods! Don't depend on the luck of the gods! !"
to Kinnikuman.
I think readers have always felt that Kinnikuman was the main character, that he never lost because he was the main character, and that he somehow won in a way that wasn't based on his strength.
But by having Ramenman make this comment, Yudetamago himself has already made the first move and warned him that he could not use that move.
With this one statement, readers were left wondering, "Oh, so Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin by his own strength?
How? How?
From an artist's point of view, this is a line from Yudetamago-sensei, who creates his works, as if he has imposed a binding on himself.
This is a great thing he has done.
It is definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend at Aobayama in Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting Co., Ltd.) - Yahoo!
The first winter illumination has begun at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, and the park is now enveloped in gentle light.
（The winter illumination, which started on November 26, features a 20-meter-high camphor tree, a strolling garden, and a strolling garden. The park's 20-meter-high camphor tree, walking paths, lawns, and other areas are scattered with a total of 50,000 LED light bulbs.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture commented, "It's been a long time since I came to Fukui, and I was surprised to see such a place.
It was very beautiful and I felt relieved".
The illumination was planned for the first time in order to provide visitors with a sense of healing while avoiding the dense city. The lights will be on from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25.
On the 25th, the last day of the event, a Christmas event will be held, featuring a pot of button stew and a movie screening.
I think there are only a limited number of people who can read through the documents in order.
I have a friend who can read a lot, and when I asked him about it, he told me that he could do it, but he had to start from the basics of Linux and read the table of contents in a reference book rather than reading the documentation.
(Actually, it is easier to apply and understand Linux than to start with something as abstract as docker.
It's hard to understand everything without that.
It's OK if you understand it.

He also said that you don't have to memorize the contents of the book, but only remember the parts you skipped before and read them when you need them.

The Orchidium Agricultural Promotion Association broadcasts live from Yonezawa to promote agriculture and livestock products.
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, consisting of municipalities in the Okitama region and the Japan Agricultural Cooperative Association (JA), launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," in which products are sold via video distribution over the Internet. The event was the first of its kind organized by Minato Ward, Tokyo.
The "Nationwide Cooperation MINATO Market" was organized for the first time by Minato Ward, Tokyo. The Yamagata Ai no Busyoutai and others appeared remotely on "National Cooperation MINATO Market TV," which was planned for the first time by Minato Ward, Tokyo, to deliver local specialties and regional attractions.
The "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," an initiative of the Okitama region and Minato Ward, led to the decision to open a stall, which was broadcast live from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who works as a "Satoyama Sommelier," presented the Yonezawa textile brand "nitorito" at the event. Mika Kuroda, a "Satoyama Sommelier," introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature, wearing a stole of the "nitorito" brand.

I had a misfortune this morning...
My NAS PC stopped turning on: 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
〜What happened ~.
1.) In the morning, I opened the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC was on. 2.) A little later, I went back into the room.
2.) When I returned to my room a little later, I noticed a pink-rotor-like sound coming from the PC and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought it was just the fan not working properly due to the low room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3.) No startup.
When the power button is pressed, the power light comes on for a moment and the fan runs, but it stops immediately.
After that, it would not start.
I unplugged the power plug and tried again, but it still came on for a moment.
4.) I tried connecting only the motherboard, ATX 20-pin, and 4-pin, and disconnecting the other parts, but it did not start.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause of the problem because I have heard a buzzing sound from the PSU fan hitting something before.
I'll try it later when I find an extra ATX power supply.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work...what should I do?
Maybe I should change the case and mother together...

How do you dispose of your computer and peripherals?
* PC Farm
I've brought them in once, but they don't collect them for free from Saitama Prefecture, even though they are located in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture.
(There is free if it is relatively new)
* Inverse Net
I've never used it, but I heard that with Sagawa, it's completely free with pay-on-delivery shipping.
I'm thinking of using them, so I'd like to hear about their reputation if anyone knows about them.
* Bulky waste, etc. (charged) , addendum > Municipal collection boxes (small appliances free of charge)
* Selling used items.
Selling them secondhand.
Are there people who sell at flea markets or auctions? I have never sold a used PC.
Maybe it's wise to sell them while you can get money for them.
* Postscript＞ Lynet Japan Information provided by /u/CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers, old UPSs, etc. that no one will take are getting in the way.
They're not bulky trash size, so probably won't cost me anything, but they're being put off for some reason.
I collect coins as a hobby.
Please let me know if you can tell me how much these coins are worth.
Coins circulating in foreign countries are worthless ....
In Japan, banknotes are exchanged, but not coins.
Commemorative gold coins are worth more because they contain gold.
You sometimes dislike a person who has done nothing wrong, don't you?

I can't get a girlfriend. Are you discriminated by your face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that we are judged by our looks.
I can't show them what's on the inside.
What did you do with your school sportswear after graduation?
I wear them as everyday clothes ^_^.
I threw mine away right after graduation.
Yome used it as loungewear until we started living together. lol
Is it possible for a person to be 90 or 100 years old and still be a rear ender?
You lose all sexual desire and youth, though.
As long as you are in good health.
Men's Volleyball First final in 29 years! / Men's Fencing Fleur finished 4th and did not win a medal!
Ryujin Nippon, first time in 29 years, tops 8! Japan men's volleyball team advances to Final T. Coach Nakagakiuchi: "It was a big goal."
I thought it was hopeless when they took the third set in the Referee Challenge x2, but they won in a full set!
Fencing Men's Fleurette Team: Japan fails to medal, loses to U.S.A.
I think he was different than his opponents up to the semi-finals, but why is such an opponent in the 3rd place match?
I would like to plant a tree in my yard that will serve as a blindfold, any recommendations?
My hope is for a tree that is easy to care for, evergreen, and preferably one that bears fruit.
Best regards.
In order for the feijoa to bear fruit, it is better to plant other fruiting trees nearby, such as olives, blueberries, plums, etc., which will bear fruit.
How much money do we need to save for each other to live together?
It depends on each person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you want to have.
You should not live together.
There is a high possibility that you will break up.
It is better to make a proper matchmaker, have a binding ceremony, go through this and that bridal process, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation has no merit.
I suggest you don't do it...
I went to a game center today and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarising.
Oh! I thought it was a Legendary Rare, but it was a re-recorded Legendary Rare (^_^;)
Is it possible to play a card game like Ganbarising as a hobby?
I think it is possible.
