When I tried to purchase the entry package, the blue and orange packages came out.
The orange one is more than double the price.
What's the difference?
I couldn't figure it out even after looking it up, so please tell me.
Right now, there should only be blue.
If there is, it's probably just an old product.

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Does this mean that entertainers have become impossible? Television is full of entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were a lot of scenes where the staff would laugh hysterically behind your back even when you were saying something that wasn't particularly funny.
It must be creepy to be told not to laugh at everything you say because you're a popular comedian, when it's clearly not funny.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainer's mood will be spoiled, and it will be bad for business relationships.
That industry is like the old black market, it's like a gymnasium, and some entertainers' egos are so big that they behave in a disgusting manner, otherwise they wouldn't be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say, "Don't pick on entertainers," as if the entertainers themselves are exaggerating the difficulty of their work.
I know that my income will be quite small until I can sell it, but even if it is said that entertainers are at the top of their profession.
It just sounds like a glorification of their own careers and a justification for why comedians have too high a place in the media and society.
To be honest, there are parts of the industry I work in that are pretty tough, but I feel like things that touch on the entertainment industry are getting more and more difficult.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like if I didn't let it out like a fart, it wouldn't be good for my body...

An order placed at a Tsukumo online shop was arbitrarily replaced
Summary: I ordered a wireless mouse that was on sale, received the wired version of the mouse and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund
It's more of an e-commerce problem than a home-built PC issue, but I'm not convinced no matter how I look at it, and since it's a famous place, I'll write about it here.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was on sale for 3,280 yen (link to Gyotaku) during the Tsukumo Day sale at Tsukumo Net Shop, which started the previous Friday.
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so I checked the page of the wired version, taking into account the possibility of a price error, and it was 5,071 yen (Link to Gyotaku), so I ordered it thinking that it might not be a mistake.
The order e-mail arrived normally, and the next-day shipping e-mail also arrived.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history on my page.
At this point, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive, since there was no notification of error or cancellation notice from order to shipment.
This was the problem, and a few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in the registration of the product.
according to the email
* The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version
* Since the wired mouse has already been shipped,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel completely
2.Return only the mouse for a refund
3. Use a wired mouse as it is
choose your response.
The product pages for the wired version and the wireless version are separate, and although the wireless version is written in the purchase history, e-mail, and delivery note, it seems that it was arbitrarily replaced with the wired version.
Isn't it awful to be sent something different from what you bought without your permission, and if you want a refund, you have to send it back from here?
Even if you eventually accept a refund, I want to fight back, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you were looking for marriage or a partner, wouldn't you want to date someone who didn't have a good relationship with your family?
Or does it not matter?
If you care, why is that?
For example, people who are estranged from their parents or siblings.
i don't really care.
The reason why they don't get along is because both parents and siblings have different personalities and unreasonable people.

Isolated twice... Typhoon and heavy rain wash out the only bridge leading to the district, residents triple their food reserves <Yamatsuri-cho, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima Television) - Yahoo! News
Matsumoto Yoshiro from Takahara district, Yasai-cho, Fukushima prefecture.
It was the East Japan typhoon in 2019 that had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "At first, I was like, 'Are you serious?'
I wondered if it would break so quickly, or if it would be washed away." The only road leading to the Kachihara district, "Kachihara Bridge," was washed away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 30 residents of 11 households in the district isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to use JR's iron bridge, which is not normally open to traffic, to transport necessary supplies.
Mr. Matsumoto Yoshiro: "Normally, a car can come to the garden, but when I get off the car over there, I hold it in my hand or walk with it on my back across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt grateful for the means of transportation and the car." The emergency bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and became isolated again for several days until the temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and restoration has progressed, but Ms. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on lessons learned.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to somehow secure enough food for two to three days." Foods that can be used as emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, have been prepared about three times as much as before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto Misako: "It's not someone else's business, and since I don't know when a disaster will befall me, I felt anew that it would be better for everyone to stock up a little" On the other hand, Yamatsuri Town experienced an "unforeseen disaster" in which a bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own initiative from 2021.
Takahashi Ryuichi, Director of the Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: "We have announced that we would like to set October 12 as "Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day" and make it a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year.
I think people are more aware than ever that the unexpected can happen."
Article at the time of purchase
Since the test itself is almost over, all I have to do is write a sentence, but I am also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is correct, so please wait a bit.
I can well understand that you will not be confident in the measurement results.
If the Olympics had not been held in China, do you think Hanyu's ranking would have changed?

Experience a paramarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event on December 12, 2021, where people could run a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.
This event was held to let people experience the new fun of sports and the charm of sightseeing in Tokyo through digital means.
Running machines and road bikes were set up at the venue, and visitors to the venue were able to run the marathon course of the Paralympics, which was recreated in a virtual space, while wearing special equipment.
An avatar of the user appears on each tablet where the virtual space is projected, allowing the user to experience running a marathon course with participants from Japan and overseas, and also enjoy sightseeing spots in Tokyo.
The participants ... "The scenery was so different and it was so fun. "
"Running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's hard when you're running, but it's great fun to be able to run while having fun, and I'm glad I was able to compete with everyone and do my best until the end." The person in charge in Tokyo said, "I want people to enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and hopes to install it at the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
Newly established "building condition survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Transactions of second-hand housing are strong.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums have risen, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a house has increased due to the corona crisis, the popularity of properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station," "large-scale" and "tower," which are soaring in price, has concentrated, and the sharp decline in relatively cheap newly built properties is also likely to have had an impact.
[See the image in this article] However, the share of existing (pre-owned) housing distribution in Japan is still very low compared to overseas.
Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Law in 2018 and started a building condition survey, so-called inspection, for the purpose of trading safe and secure used houses (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect familiar with housing checks the current state of the property, including deterioration, and the condition of the building, compiles a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid claims after handover by conducting a property survey before the sale transaction, giving buyers a sense of security.
This, in turn, is said to lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer side, it is a system that can grasp the condition of the second-hand house to be purchased, and can be purchased with conviction, and it is a system that has great merit at first glance.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in investigating the condition of the building.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system became mandatory.
In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain, "In the case of property brokerage, we can introduce an architect to investigate the condition of the building" or "we cannot," but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.
This is a system in which the buyer requests a building survey from a specialist known as an "inspector" or "building surveyor" at the preliminary stage of a home purchase.
For example, in the United States, inspections are carried out in 70% to 90% of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
In that the inspection is led solely by the "buyer," the nature of the inspection is very different from the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly led by the "seller."
The seller wants to show the condition of the building as much as possible, and sell it as quickly and for as much as possible.
The buyer, on the other hand, wants to live with peace of mind after examining the survey results and making appropriate repairs.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a gap in the goals and thoughts of both sides.
For this reason, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern with regard to Japan's system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection stipulated by the government will be kept to a minimum.
Because it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects. ●For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the case in charge can be said to be a customer.
As a result, inspections may be "rigged" by not reporting adverse findings to the seller.

It was a lot of work.
However, I recovered mentally (?), so I was fully motivated.
I used to fall asleep at work, partly because I was a researcher and couldn't keep up physically.
When it was the first of the year, it was the second time, so I took about a month off and said goodbye to the fucking garbage company. It was more serious than I thought it would be, and the medicine didn't work, so it dragged on with a feeling of wanting to see it.
In any case, it's important to go to a psychiatrist and get the right treatment, and it's important to keep a record of hospital visits (extremely important).
Even if you leave the company for personal reasons, as long as you have a history of hospitalization, you can change it to leave the company for company reasons at the discretion of the doctor in Harowa, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance and so on are clearly lowered.

Was Ginza an island?
5 trivia topics you can talk about while wearing a silver bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
"This used to be a peninsula.
As proof of this, it is unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia.
Here are some interesting tidbits about Ginza that you'll want to share with someone.
Going to the top of Ginza!?
First time sneaking into Kinza
As you walk around Ginza, you can see traces of the history that has been carved into the Ginza area, such as the quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
Walking through Ginza with her, I was struck by the sudden silence and thought, "This used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, is synonymous with the downtown area that gave rise to "XX Ginza" in various parts of Japan.
Originally, "Ginza" referred to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 the Ginza government office, which had been located in present-day Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Money Exchange Town," but when it was moved to Shishaku-cho, it became known as "Ginza."
By the way, the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" that jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, there was an inlet from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomae-jima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the bakufu in Edo, he reclaimed the bay and promoted the development of the Kyobashi district.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the streets and had the moat widened in order to develop boat transportation.
Then, they filled in the cove by cutting down the earth from the moat and Mt. Kanda.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza flagship store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku) there is a stone monument marking the site of the former Ginza government office, the "birthplace of Ginza," so be sure to look there if you're interested.
Ginza's "pilgrimage to sacred places" known only to those in the know
In Ginza, the "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour" is held every year, which is known as a "pilgrimage to sacred places" among those in the know.
Of the more than 10 shrines, the most obvious is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki Theater.
Many people visit the shrine, which stands on the far right of the Kabukiza, before and after watching a performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo-son" is on Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine," "Azuma Inari Shrine" and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley, but are less conspicuous, "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to have been revered by Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon, and "Successful Inari Shrine" on the 1st floor entrance of Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places that enshrine Acala and Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, but most shrines enshrine Inari.
The "Inari Shrine," where a fox greets you in front of the shrine, was built with great care, as it is believed that there are many farmers in the area who benefit from the "abundance of grain" that comes from a good harvest of rice.
As a result, it came to be said that in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was beneficial for business prosperity, and the belief spread even in Ginza, the busiest shopping district in Japan.

Man's body found in Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo Television NEWS) - Yahoo! News
Just before noon on the 12th, a man was found dead face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya.
Police are investigating the man's identity and the cause of death.
According to the police, just before 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidani, Moriyama Ward, and called 911.
The man was rescued from the river but was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police are investigating the cause of death as they rush to confirm the identity.
Meanwhile, in Sunagawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river and confirmed dead.
The man's clothes were undisturbed, but a bicycle was found nearby.
Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident as they work to establish his identity.

South Korea's Posco International to acquire Australia's Senex Energy, expand overseas gas field business: Korean report (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on the 12th that it has entered into a share purchase agreement with Senex Energy in Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
The acquisition is scheduled to be completed in March next year, pending the approval of Sennex Energy's shareholders at a general meeting and the approval of the local subsidiary.
This is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) since POSCO International was merged into POSCO Group in 2010.
The total amount of the acquisition is KRW 770.9 billion, of which POSCO International has decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided to make this acquisition because demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and it believes that natural gas-based blue hydrogen will split the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local onshore gas field operation personnel in Australia.

Could that knee pain be "knee osteoarthritis"?!
Different treatment depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor: I've been having knee pain recently.
What are the possible diseases?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "osteoarthritis" is common among Japanese people.
Editor: Does this mean that the joint will be deformed?
Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for cushioning the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, cartilage can become worn down and distorted due to aging, obesity, and strenuous sports.
As a result, it leads to joint deformation and inflammation.
Editors: Does osteoarthritis affect more than just the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the knuckles and base of the hand, neck, waist, big toe, hip, etc.
However, most cases occur in the knee, and are called "knee osteoarthritis."
Editor: First of all, what is the structure of a joint?
Dr. Maruyama: The joint is made up of two bones that are unevenly joined.
The area where the two bones meet is covered with "articular cartilage," and the perimeter of the joint is wrapped in "articular capsule."
Editor: It's a complicated structure.
Maruyama: That's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains a tissue called the synovium, which produces synovial fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and consists of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
This is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing the movement of the knee."
Editors: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding.
In other words, it acts as a cushion.
However, if it is worn down or distorted, it can deform or inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are being washed, I put on a jersey or something and go to sleep!

He said that he thought about quitting somehow, and then just quit.

3 gambling & games from the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (real sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji" has exploded in popularity, especially among men.
One of the real pleasures of this work is the extreme game where you risk your life.
[Picture] My feet tingle just looking at it ... ... Take on the challenge of crossing the steel frame!
Therefore, this time I would like to examine the Kaiji game that can actually be played or is practiced in the planning video.
"Numa" This is the trap-filled pachinko machine "Numa" that appeared in "Gambler Kaiji."
In the original, he surprised Kaiji with a high rate of 4,000 yen per ball.
In this "swamp," large traps such as "nail forest," "movable object" and "three-tiered croon" were set up, making it almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used every trick in the book, and in the end, he was faced with the arduous task of placing a vinyl water tank on the building and tilting it to sink the foundation, which he mastered brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball," and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you will be able to enjoy the feeling of Kaiji.
Steel-framed parade The "human horse race" steel-framed parade was held for the debtors, including Kaiji, at a "starside party" held by a rich man as a side show.
The debtors race to avoid falling over the thin steel frame, which is set up 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people take part, and the top two can win cash prizes, but there are only four steel frames, and safety measures are inadequate, so there is a high chance of death.
This steel-framed crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being deployed as a VR game, you can experience it very closely at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi," the home of the professional baseball team, Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge has a steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and there is a "Skijoranko" and a "Victory Bridge" in front of it, which you can walk to.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
The comedian Koala Koarashi released a video on his YouTube channel in which he walked across the Eagle Bridge, saying, "You can experience steel bridge crossing in Japan," and it became a hit.
E-card A two-player card game, "E-card."
A total of ten cards are used: one card for the emperor, eight cards for the citizens, and one card for the slaves. The players are divided into the emperor side and the slave side.
The game is very well done and has the characteristic that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa with a strict rule that if he loses, he will have his ears cut off.
After a hard-fought battle, Kaiji realized that the ear-destroying earphone-like device attached to his ear was reading his psychology by sensing and transmitting changes in his pulse and body temperature. He confused Tonegawa by grinding his ear to the limit and making his body abnormal, and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon, etc.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing an e-card game with Fujiwara Tatsuya, who played the role of Kaiji in the film, which attracted a lot of attention.
■Would you like to feel like a ninja?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's true that when you read the manga, you can get a taste of what it's like.
How about experiencing that worldview through a game?
Prefectural Gokoku Shrine and a large ema of a tiger as a step into the new year, and gentle encouragement |Yamagata Newspaper
Preparations for the New Year are underway at Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where a large ema of next year's zodiac animal, the tiger, has appeared.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held a memorial service in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has been asking students from the College of Art and Design to draw the original ema.
This time, a work by third-year student Tsuchiya Yui (22) was chosen from among nine works drawn by students in the Japanese painting course in the art department, which is taught by Professor Suenaga Toshiaki.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide, with a height of about 1.8 meters in the center.
Ms. Tsuchiya said that she drew it with "the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
The image of the tiger pausing to look at the cherry blossoms is a wish to "enjoy the beauty of nature even in a rapidly changing world."
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on a votive tablet distributed to the public.
Chiba Kenichi (44) from Gonnegi said, "I think it will help everyone overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano where I want to continue to live" Workshop for 4 high school students in the city on recommendations: Sanyo Newspaper Digital | San-digi
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano are jointly working on a workshop to think about "Tamano where I want to continue living."
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center," the voices of young people will be collected and proposed to mayors.
"When is it fun? ."
When asked by the facilitator, the students answered variously, such as "when I get excited with a lot of people" and "when I'm playing the drums."
The first event was held on November 13th at Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
Using the "world cafe" method, in which 18 high school students and local residents move around an "island" with a specific theme and discuss it with each other, they thought about "interesting towns," "livable towns" and "towns that give you a reason to live."
Each thought is written out on a sticky note, pasted on imitation paper and organized.
"A town with many young people seems interesting" "Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability" .
We will have further discussions to see if there is anything in common.
"I thought Tamano would be boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is attractive," said a third-year student at Tamano Commerce and Industry High School (18).
A third-year student at Binnan High School (18) said, "There are few shops and traffic is inconvenient, but places with rich nature are nice," and through talking with adults, he realized not only the problems of the area, but also its attractions.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to sort out the contents of the recommendations.
The mayor and superintendent of education will be invited to make an announcement in February next year.
The president of the center, Torie Azuma, said, "We hope that this will foster a love of the local area in high school students, as well as provide an opportunity for young people to be actively involved in town planning."

How to find a new way to tie a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A scarf is essential in winter, but is there a time when the fabric feels tight around the neck?
It's a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding, but I sometimes hear people say that they don't know how to do it.
I was wondering if there was a stole that didn't require fabric and could be rolled up quickly, and then I found a novel one.
The "COTTORI" brand stoles are about 1 meter in length, which is a more compact size than common ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, "How can they make it so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is made by knitting a long, thin piece of fabric, and the whole thing is in the shape of a net.
The end of the scarf can pass through the mesh.
So you can wind it and fasten it even if you don't tie the ends together.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are also popular as outerwear, but many people will be wearing them in combination with stoles to keep their shoulders warm.
If you have a stole like this, I'm sure it will come in handy.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super funny
It's called Get Buck, directed by Peter Jackson.
It's fresh in a lot of ways, like a life-size Beatles.
I'm giggling because it's just before the breakup, but it's not the dramatic giggle I imagined.
There's Paul, who's trying his best to be in charge and is like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!" and George, who's like, "But..." and is a creep, and John, who's like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!" and John, who's like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!" and John, who's like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!" and John, who's like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!" and John, who's like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!" and Paul, who's like, "I know I'm a pain in the ass, but come on!"
In that way, we don't hate each other so much that we fight, but there is a feeling in the air that "well, we can't work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that, dismantling the legend or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance began, everyone was really full of talent.
The process of going from a little phrase to "that famous song" while both of us are going "what about this?" is terrible.
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck comes together is amazing.
It's amazing that the scenes where the lyrics come in are well-recorded, with the cheeky snort gradually turning into that "Zucha♪Zucha♪."
It's amazing because you don't get to see the composition process like this very often.
Also, it's only natural, but everyone is working so hard, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems to be just one of three episodes, but I had the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup so far was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them seemed to be enjoying themselves as they began to write songs, even if they complained a bit, but when it came to the question of where to hold the concert, it was easy to see that the producers and promoters were saying things like "After all, the Beatles came from the best in the world!" and that it was out of their hands.
Well, since the director's interpretation is also included in the documentary, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, since Paul seems to be supervising, I thought that might be why there are a lot of scenes where Paul seems to be the bad guy.

←Of course, I think it's best to think about this after taking some time to rest and relax.
However, since I think that there are daily life, if there is a company's union or industrial doctor or a window where you can consult, there may be some kind of system so it would be good to consult once.
I hope that I will be able to live a little more comfortably in the future.

Unseasonably warm weather and cold blasts cause tornadoes in US (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, a number of tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
Although it was the warmest on record for this time of the year, strong cold air moving southward caused the atmosphere to become very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds are thought to have developed rapidly.
In the southern United States, warm air from the southwest brought record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time has risen to nearly 30°C.
In spite of this record warmth, strong cold air of -30°C or lower descended southward at around 5500m above sea level. As a result, an active front formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes are believed to have occurred one after another in the area.
The southern United States is an area that is prone to tornadoes, but it is high season from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this time.
A record number of nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day this winter.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and wind gusts on the 10th (Friday) alone, local time.
According to this, it can be seen that there are roughly two concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached EF3, the third strongest out of six levels, and it is believed that a wind gust of around 70 m/s blew at the moment.
Depending on future investigations, it may be judged to be EF4~5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the modified Fujita scale) is used, which is based on the modified Fujita scale and adapted to the conditions of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the U.S. this time, is likely to occur in Japan, and is at the level of collapsing wooden houses.

Voices calling for help broadcast live from under the rubble of the "largest tornado in history" in the US (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, U.S. President Biden said on the 11th (Japan time on the 12th) that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history" with a mysterious expression on his face.
U.S. broadcaster CNN reported the news.
"We're going to do everything we can as a federal government," Biden said.
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he explained.
More than 100 people are feared dead.
[Photo] Residents carry belongings from their destroyed homes in tornado-damaged Kentucky. From the evening of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
The record for the area affected by a tornado is 219 miles (approx. 350 km), which caused damage in Missouri and other places in 1925, but meteorologists at CNN in the US also estimated that this tornado was the largest, with an area of about 250 miles (approx. 400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which suffered the most damage, a candle factory that had been operating around the clock in preparation for Christmas sales was also badly damaged.
There were 110 people working there at the time, but the building was destroyed and there is no trace of it.
In the darkness, a woman pinned under the five-foot-thick rubble felt the weight of rescuers searching through the debris and pleaded for help in a Facebook Live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the woman's cries for help, the live broadcast also included screams and another woman singing "Happy Birthday to You" in what appeared to be a tearful attempt to dispel her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in Mayfield, was safe after she and her 5-year-old son hid in the basement of their home as a tornado warning was issued.
He recalled, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrifying sound like a ground reverberation, like something was erupting."
A Mayfield Police Department spokesman said: "The search will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know if it will be weeks, months or years," he said as he continued his hard work.
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead after a portion of an Amazon warehouse partially collapsed.
Train cars have been derailed by the impact, and highways have been blocked one after another due to the impact of falling cars.
According to US web media, a total of about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.

It's tough not being able to get social security...
i'm praying we can work something out.
If you have a "living-in job" like a part-time job at a ryokan or resort, you can secure both an address and a source of income, but in the current social situation caused by the corona crisis, there are fewer options.
There seems to be a site like this every once in a while, though.

What does it mean to be a doctor specializing in gynecology?
"Specialists" are doctors who are in their third to fifth year after graduation.
They are also called "major doctors" and "post-graduate trainee doctors."
So-called "trainee doctors" are "initial trainee doctors" and refer to doctors who are in their first or second year after graduation.
Speaking of immature, they are immature, but in the fourth or fifth year, they will be able to provide a certain level of medical care, so they will be entrusted with various tasks.

There is a long-standing argument that there are different ways of thinking about the star rating system.
While other countries use five stars as a standard from which points are deducted, Japan claims to use three stars as a neutral point from which points are added or deducted.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have a completely different meaning as "there is a point deduction factor" and "it is not a masterpiece, but it is an honorable work."
If the five-star system is used as a standard, "works that have no flaws only" and "works of the highest standard in all respects" will be in the same category, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a system defect that does not present the meaning of the star, but since such a system is actually operated in such a way, I would like you not to give three stars (notoriety).
So when you try to counter people who make this argument with Steam's two-choice rating, the argument falls apart.

Is there an underwater pump that can be plugged in the size of a common hose and powered by USB?
The capacity of the power supply that can be taken from USB is 5V and up to about 2A, so it is only 10W.
The submersible pump consumes at least 500W, depending on the model, so it's completely impossible.

The self-made radio volume
I built an AM radio with my own capacitors and coils, but it was so noisy that I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was on a different frequency than I was tuned to.
It's possible that the tuning was too soft and I couldn't hear it well, but it was different from the expected station...
But here's the thing: I'm supposed to have created an am radio, but it sounds like I'm listening to an fm radio.
Why do you think that is?
Can I turn off the ESP of SMIM or Dlizzio's Mesh Fixes?
Mods that use ESP to distribute textures and meshes don't need ESP if they're deployed as Lose files in the right place.
I saw a story about that somewhere, but I can't remember where...
I understand the risks, so I don't actually plan to do it, but I can only sleep at night worrying about it.
I'd like you to tell me if it's technically possible.
If anyone remembers it, please let me know if I can do it.

<A note on eating fish> "Hakobune"'s "seasonal fish fry caught in the nearby sea and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce" |Living and culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunch box "Seasonal fried fish and fried shrimp caught near the sea, homemade tartar sauce"
"hakobune" is a take-out restaurant specializing in colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) made with plenty of vegetables.
Mr. Kozuki Takayuki (39) and Ms. Arimi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year with the aim of "giving customers the feeling of being in a restaurant at home."
One of the most popular items on the lunch menu is the fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce (1000 yen).
The fish choose the best of the moment in the market.
"The fries are made with as little fresh bread crumbs as possible so that you can tell the texture of the ingredients" (Mr. Takayuki), and you can tell the plump texture of the fried shrimp directly.
The bento comes with about four kinds of side vegetables and deli items, as well as Hinohikari branched rice from Saga, rice with miscellaneous grains, and soup.
The vegetables are home-grown from the soba fields or purchased at direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the time of year, but Takayuki has been training in French cuisine, and lappet and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, they have a mix of Japanese and Western food that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as "a comforting taste that you're used to eating" (Ami) like dashi-wrapped eggs.
The bento "Hamburg steak made with meat from domestic abalone" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the "Charcuterie Set," a processed meat product that goes well with alcohol such as wine, will also be on sale.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and saw something interesting, so I tried it.
Ride quality Not that bad, but occasionally shaky (but not enough to get you drunk)
speed. naturally slow.
Safety When there are people around, it slows down and in some cases completely stops, so I think it is safe at first, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
The gaze of others is painful. It's good to be looked at, but it hurts my heart when I'm looked at as if I'm "in the way."
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there was still room for improvement.
Unfortunately, it would be easier to use if there were a few less people, or if there was some consideration to have people move to the edges.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create a dedicated lane so as not to get in the way of other pedestrians.
However, because it is a leisurely ride, I thought it would be nice if there were fewer people on it, so I could relax while looking at the scenery.
It was an exciting ride with a futuristic feeling of wondering if this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and it was a difficult ride unless you are a patient person who finds it comfortable to look around you.
I was so fucking embarrassed.

I like unagi, but when I thought that just because everyone is eating it with sauce, the part of the unagi may actually be anything other than how it's grilled... I thought that the texture and weight of the unagi is quite important.

A man was slashed and fled on a male motorcycle, and on the 12th, there was an attempted murder in Saga City, Saga Prefecture | Cases and Accidents | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed in the face with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on a street in Saga's Otani 1-chome.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and Saga Minami Station is searching for him as an attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, a passerby called 110 to report that they were "fighting."
The man suffered an injury to his left cheek about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep, but is said to be conscious.
The man who ran away is a medium-sized skinhead.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man had been drinking with several acquaintances, and it is being investigated as if there was some kind of traffic trouble between the pedestrian and the motorcyclist.

A family's long journey to establish environmental protection on China's frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Corporate consultant, Hong Kong company Find Asia) China, with its vast territory, is also important in terms of biodiversity. It is home to the world's largest variety of mammals and the third largest variety of plants.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists in addition to environmental protection by local governments.
Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such area.
Her younger sister, Lee Wan Ho, is currently active as an actress. See Sapana is a region that borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Si (Thai) ethnic group," which shares its roots with the Thai ethnic group in the Kingdom of Thailand.
It is the source of the Mekong River, which flows through various countries in Southeast Asia.
Xishuangbanna and Tai people (Xishuangbanna and Nahua people) Autonomous Prefecture The area of Xishuangbanna is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we met Mr. Li Bingguo, who is engaged in environmental protection activities at Sea Sapanna, and he told us about the contents of his activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband - - It has been almost 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger for that?
Ms. Lee: Our environmental protection activity "Tenso" started in 2000.
It all started with my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This was China's only tropical rainforest region and boasted some of the country's greatest biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development lagged behind.
For this reason, large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforests was carried out in the past in order to establish industries in this region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study the restoration of natural resources and biological resources.
He met me, who was a reporter here, and we got married.
Q: Did you have any interest in conservation before this?
Ms. Lee: I'm from Xizapanna, but I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I had to promote the project with my husband without his knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though they are not well-shaped or particularly tall. Why do you think that is?

An aura is not something that comes out when you want it to.
It's something that comes naturally the moment you gain self-confidence.
I'm sure that person has a strong inner confidence.

I'm wondering, is it a small thing to compliment someone's outfit or say that the color is nice?
It's not very detailed, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it will be detailed.
I've never been praised for being meticulous, so I don't really know what that means.
Maybe it was a detailed compliment.
What would you do if Sakura Yokozaki confessed to you?
I replied, "Sakura-san confessed to me that my heart is in full bloom in the spring, so please do the same," and we started dating.
And in order to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at a later time?
If you apply at the same time, the process will be completed faster.
Now it takes about a week to complete.
In addition, since there is no fee, we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it as soon as you want.

[Oma-Kan/Personal note] It took about a month and a half to identify what was causing CTD in the MOD's own environment.
While the data was stable until March, CTD due to multiple factors occurred from around the Golden Week holiday period, when there was not much time to play, so it took a long time to identify the problem, even though it was investigated little by little, mainly during the holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with .Net Script Framework (you'll understand in a few minutes) Some of the errors in the .dll series and mesh relationships do not remain in the crash log.
Timing of major CTDs
* Leaves no footprint on the logs of all Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins of the type that leave logs.
* When killing some NPCs/accumulating attacks: Activated with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE update restart version) Improved with OFF * Is there a possibility of false accusation about this?
* When using the camera to trigger a kill move on some NPCs, turn off the kill move setting on the PC via .ini. This is a basic improvement: Conflicting settings between DAR and Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic Outdoor) While moving on the field + some magic (e.g. Freeze Rune) Activated, when NPC is hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID use NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) All OFF and all improved with 5 consecutive attempts.
Was it due to the additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or a shader setting error in the body mesh? It should be noted that the default for using SPID in 2.0.ini has a formatting error, but as a result, the intended result was achieved and the presupposition Perk was applied to NPCs.
At first, I focused on checking by falsely accusing it of being a part attack or an OnHit-related motion/combat MOD (.dll), but the result was something like this.
I don't think there have been any similar bug reports, at least not at the English, German, or French levels.
If by any chance there are people who have a similar CTD problem in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful to post it as a reminder.
Rather, everyone is on edge mentally.
People around me don't even notice it, let alone my colleagues or my family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that although he seems to be having a hard time, he is working well and energetically.
However, he is probably on the edge of his mental state.
I haven't retired in the name of my mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric outpatient care - after today's outpatient care
Since I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving home care for a long time, but I have been getting to know the nurse (female) at the home care station I am currently using for a long time, and I think we have built a very good relationship.
We talk about a lot of things every week.
Of course, they will also do what is necessary for medication administration (such as packaging), but above all, I thought about how important it is for people with mental illness to have fun communication with the visiting nurses today.
Today, we had a chat about the gender differences between men and women, and even discussed gender theory, which made me laugh.
They talk about the sex drive of men and women, how she got divorced, and things like, "Can I be a home health aide?"
Occasionally, I dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that, in the case of visiting nurses' stations run by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who are no longer able to work in the wards come in and only provide administrative support, or that occupational therapists come in as visiting nurses but give orders from above, saying, "I'm here to provide medical care."
What I use is a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think she is a really good nurse who can deal with Frank on an equal footing with me, who has a mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful.
Some of you may be receiving outpatient psychiatric care, and some of you may be considering it.
Home care can be very helpful for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, you should definitely take it.
And let's choose a good home nursing station.
In the past, I've had places cancel my contract because I couldn't get along with them.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's ... "Lagging behind on hydrogen economy roadmap" (Japanese edition of JoongAng Ilbo) - Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The plan called for the widespread use of 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative total) by 2022 and the operation of 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (approx. 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target level (approximately 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations in core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (approximately 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is 8,400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It turned out that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap implementation status was far below the target value.
On the 12th, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (JFE) released a report entitled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem."
According to the report, the reality is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane films by DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.) and 3M (U.S.).
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (accumulated from 2014 to 2020), South Korea is 5th in the world.
However, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations said, "In fact, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually in the lower ranks among competing countries."
The patent rankings by country are China, the United States, the European Union, and Japan.
Since 2017, when China overtook the U.S. to take the first place, the gap has widened.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1,033 in South Korea, which was higher than Japan (974) and ranked 4th, but 22% lower than China (4,721).
The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax deduction for capital investment and research and development costs."

Parliament on a Sunday?
Making flyers in the style of a TV show, "correspondence book" of members of parliament underway in Takasu: Hokkaido Shimbun Newspaper Doshin Online Edition
[Takasu] town council is working on a unique parliamentary reform, including the creation of a whimsical flyer to guide the holding of regular meetings and the introduction of a "correspondence book" for townspeople to evaluate councilors.
There will be no voting for the third consecutive term in the town council election, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
On the 9th, about 1,800 new flyers were distributed with newspaper inserts to publicize the Sunday assembly to be held on the 12th.
"Giron from the morning," "Tetsuko's room," "Sawaguchi Jin exploration series" ... .
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th has a catchy wording reminiscent of the name of a popular TV show.

U.S. aid, weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, troops train (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) A U.S. State Department official reported that by the 12th, equipment including small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The military aid is worth a total of 60 million dollars (approx. 6.8 billion yen) and the last equipment, including four radars that identify the firing points of mortars and other weapons, will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said the aid included lethal weaponry such as Javelin anti-tank missiles.
The military assistance is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's buildup of forces around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. has heightened its vigilance against the movements of Russian forces, and is holding discussions with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries to work out countermeasures in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden had approved the arms aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1 this year.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine has reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, the total amount of assistance has risen to more than $2.5 billion.
U.S. troops are also engaged in a training mission for Ukrainian forces.
Last month, it sent National Guard troops from the U.S. state of Florida as part of a multinational training mission in support of Ukraine.
U.S. special operations forces in Europe are also playing a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as it is a classified operation.
On the 7th of this month, President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin, but there was also a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also indicated that it is prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the "review" of inheritance and gift tax, which makes lifetime gifts "prohibited," directly hit Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax investigation committee!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking as a family during the year-end and New Year holidays!
It is "gifted before death and rushed inheritance."
While discussions on the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, the feared tax revision outline for 2022 has been shelved, but in the near future, there is a great possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the royal road to inheritance tax measures, will be "forbidden."
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In addition to a direct attack on the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax inspection committee, Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, we will thoroughly teach everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for making advantageous gifts in a hurry in time for the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Miyahara Hiroaki)
● Making lifetime gifts, which are used by everyone from wealthy individuals to office workers in urban areas, "a taboo" "From the viewpoint of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale consideration towards building a tax system that is neutral in the selection of the time of asset transfer" - - .
A single sentence in the tax reform outline for the 2021 fiscal year, announced by the ruling party last year, has caused great disquiet not only among the wealthy, but also among the middle class.
This is because what he intends to say is that he intends to drastically change the rules of inheritance and significantly increase the inheritance tax by making the royal road of inheritance tax measures, "gifting during lifetime," a "forbidden hand."
The cardinal rule of tax-saving measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce taxable assets."
The lifetime gift, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy individuals, but also by company employees who incur a small amount of inheritance tax by having a home in one of the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of this, the discussion of "integrating inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.
Although it was omitted from the tax reform outline for FY22 announced on December 10, when there were concerns that it would be implemented as quickly as possible, a more in-depth policy for unification was once again announced, including, "We will review the status of the current inheritance settlement taxation system and calendar year gift system" and "Since the gift tax exemption measure is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted), we will continuously review it."
Akira Amari, chairman of the LDP's pre-taxation investigation committee and former secretary-general, told this editorial board.
"The most important thing is to make sure that the tax burden is the same no matter when the transfer of assets takes place, without losing the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of the transfer.
At the moment, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (due to unification)." If the amendment is made as quickly as possible, there are only three chances left for a lifetime gift.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future, there will be a big push to invalidate lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly will the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My correct older brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial from January 10, 2022 Furukawa Yudai "Please look forward to it! "
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My True Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on Fuji Television from midnight on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Yamatani Kazuchika as the heroine. Based on the manga series of the same name by Morie Satoshi, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018, this is a pure love story about a man and a woman who carry their pasts with them.
Furukawa plays the main character, Haili, and Yamatani Hanazumi plays the heroine, Riyo.
College student Riyo meets her senior at her part-time job, Haili.
Hairi, who suffers from insomnia on a daily basis, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly if he borrows Riso's shoulder.
Riso becomes attracted to Hayato, who bears a resemblance to her brother, from whom she is estranged due to their parents' divorce. However, could Hayato be a murderer for some reason?
Furukawa Yudai's comment: The drama "My True Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial from January 10th!
For those who couldn't watch it on FOD, I hope you'll look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I think you'll get to know this work more deeply if you know the development and see the complex psychological depiction of Hairi and Riyo, as well as the two people who are in conflict and changing.
I'd be happy if fans of the original enjoyed it too.
Please look forward to it!

[NFL] Which team won the game with three passes? How did the players feel? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones only threw three passes for the Patriots.
It was the fewest in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills had two against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
The 1974 Bills had a once-in-a-generation RB phenom in O.J. Simpson, who had passed for more than 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the running of Simpson and another running back, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason why the Patriots played such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and its latitude is the same as that of Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius and the wind speed was 18m, and there was a snowstorm before the game.
The Bills didn't change much in their play selection because they're local.
As opposed to 30 passes, there were 25 runs.
Allen is 15-30 with 145 yards passing.
There were no interceptions and no fumbles.
In the 10 offensive series, the Red Zone was invaded 4 times, and there were opportunities to score.
In particular, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row after the end of the third quarter.
However, they were only able to take three points from one FG in those three times.
The defense in front of the goal in the final minute of the game.
Trailing by four, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd-and-9 to make it 3rd-and-14.
18 yards to goal.
On 3rd-and-14, QB Allen dribbled out of the pocket to the right, surrounded by a rushing Patriots defense.
He then attempted a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but it fell incomplete.
On that play, ace wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who was outside right, ran a shallow cross and broke free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to register with Allen.
On fourth-and-18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the left side of the field, but the pass was batted away by Patriots DB Myles Bryant.
Bryant was covering Bills wide receiver Cole Beasley one-on-one, but he saw Allen's move in the middle, released Beasley and reacted to the pass.
Allen threw both times for touchdowns, both times finding the end zone after eluding two receivers.
The pass on 4th down may have been the clincher, but there was no need to try for a TD on 3rd down.
They only have to get a first down on two plays.
It was still two minutes to go, so if they had made it 4th & short, Allen's ability to make his own runs would have come to life.

It's time to "throw away" & "replace" 3 items that tend to be in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
sponge.
No matter how often you change them, you're probably not changing your sponge as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, they still breed a lot of bacteria (it's still a good idea to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researchers behind the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says you should replace your cutting board if it starts to fray and get scratches or dents.
This is because once the scratches and grooves develop, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria proliferate.
Remember to frequently disinfect with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in 1 gallon of water if it's still okay.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and allow to dry naturally or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken crockery
Disposing of your favourite mug may be heartbreaking, but chipped surfaces are a new breeding ground for germs and bacteria.

I bought a Ryzen 7.5800X to replace the B550 and Tomaho I bought in September.
Once I went to the BIOS settings screen, but when I saved the settings and restarted, a white cursor-like dot appeared on the black screen, but it didn't blink, and I was still receiving messages.
Even if I try to rewrite the BIOS using FlashBIOS, thinking that the BIOS is damaged, it does not finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it's supposed to last about 5 minutes, but it doesn't even last an hour.
The possible reason is that the USB memory that I tried is too old and the SD card is converted and used.
I wonder if Tomaho has been sleeping too much.
Is there something else causing it to look like that?
Don't you like a man who always has a straight face?
oh! i knew someone.
He always looked like a vagabond.
They didn't hate me.

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to own brand-name products.
If it's something inconspicuous, I can have it, but I can't have something with a big monogram and "Lv" written on it like a Vuitton.
I wonder why.
I think it's good if it suits your height.
By the way, I think it would be fine in Japan.
If you're in Japan, yes.
It doesn't matter if it's gaijin-style or not.
It's better to say early, "Why am I the only one calling it quits/talking smack?"
If that makes you feel like it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, it's better to just say that you're uncomfortable.
I don't think they ever dream that maybe, just maybe, they're uncomfortable.
When I was living abroad, I had the misconception that Japanese people who went abroad, including myself, disliked the Confucian customs of the upper and lower classes, and that it was okay to say anything to the locals.
If they look like Westerners, I think they do it out of a kind of indulgence or friendliness, without any malice.
If my friends were from the West, they would call me by my middle name, but when I speak to them in Japanese, there are times when I'm a little lost as to which one to use.
Well, friends are still good.
I'm sure they're just doing it normally, but if you overlook it, it might not stop the exceptional treatment because it's gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Since this is Japan, could you please speak according to Japanese rules?
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my white friends who are naturalizing always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when making a toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely aware of it, but I think it's a good habit because I can't be treated strangely by younger or older people, or I can be treated like a Japanese person.
Because Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are people (including me) who look at such details.

I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, I feel like it's a well-translated one.
For non-native Japanese speakers, understanding the nuances of the Japanese language depends on whether you can study for a long period of time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, it would be a good idea to look for someone else.

ConsiderationThe training in "Devil's Blade" is the battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human anthem <Anime "Yukaku hen" launch commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
What makes "Demon Slayer" particularly different from other recent shonen manga is that "there's a lot of training."
It is generally accepted that training chapters that do not have battles and require training at dawn and dusk are not popular with readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that when the Straw Hat Crew was separated in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE," although he had trained for two years, he only drew the touch and quickly skipped the rest.
Well, one of the charms of Wampi is the eccentricity of the places you wander through, although "staying in the same place and training" may not be such a good fit.
By the way, it can be said that the training of the main character, Sumijiro, in "Devil's Blade" began when he begged for the life of Shizuko, who was about to take her own life, and was told by Tachioka Yoshitake, who saved his life, "Don't let others take the power of life and death!!."
The weak have no rights and no choice, they can only be crushed by the strong with all their might...
At the same time, he introduced Rintaki Sakonji, an "educator" who trains those who wish to join the Ghostbusters, and the gentleness of Yoshitake (also a bad comedian who doesn't explain his intentions).
Sumijiro's first contact with Rintaki was when he was asked, "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" and he replied, "I'm slow at making decisions," to Sumijiro who was stuck for an answer.
Even among fans, there is a lot of chatter, which at first glance seems unreasonable.
However, walking around with a sister who has become an ogre is pregnant with the possibility that there may come a moment when such a decision must be made.
It can be said to be an initiation into the training from the mindset.
However, Rintaki takes Sojiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air is thin and the mountain is full of pitfalls, trebuchets and traps, and I'm sure I'll die before I can start my training.
Even so, he uses his keen sense of smell to sniff out the faint scent of a trap set by a human hand, and barely manages to avoid it, making him the "main character correction."
Even so, it is the essence of demon-slaying to make Sojiro say, "I'm not going to suddenly become physically strong enough to avoid all of that!!"
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any reason, and when they wake up, they can only use the "powers and techniques they've honed up until then" to their full potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who make an effort, but does not reward those who do not, is a human hymn that is different from demons that can have supernatural powers without basis, and it is a hard-to-change rule that is consistent with this work.
is this old?
Still, instead of sleeping on a bed, they sleep on a mat directly in front of the house, with a futon and a comforter.
because the house is not a condominium.
That's what I do.
If you have a large room, it's better to sleep with a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Is it an obsession?
If you're working part-time and you want to work full-time, do you get frustrated working at other stores?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, I don't think it's a "battle."
I think it's "obsessive-compulsive" to try to get more with the least amount of effort.

Samsung Electronics Korea Establishes "DX Division" Integrating Consumer Electronics and Mobile, "Emphasizing User Experience" (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics' consolidation of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, it was announced on the 12th that the name will be changed to DX (Device eXperience) and this will be reflected in the reorganization at the end of the year.
The aim is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile to consumer electronics.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly established DX division, which was created by integrating the CE and IM divisions, will consist of business units such as VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
A Samsung Electronics official explained that "the name change reflects the company's medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthened global leadership."
In addition, he added that it emphasized the intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy optimized experiences through service solutions that reflect the needs of customers, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the strategy of creating synergy effects across the entire company and building a foundation for differentiated products and services beyond the boundaries between organizations was also reflected in the name.
Through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council," Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy to enable users to freely use content and services through interconnection between devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

It's a little unnatural here.
The caddisfly larvae lie in wait in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, allowing only the disc-shaped head to peek out of the sand.
I think it should be.
what concerns me is
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at it from the ant's perspective?
I wonder.
If you translate armoured heads as a disc-shaped head, I think the part that "on the scale of an ant, it's a behemoth wearing a helmet" disappears...
Trailer driver involved in Aichi 24-car collision has no chronic illness, but may have been careless (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
The driver of a tractor-trailer that was arrested and referred to the public prosecutor's office for an accident in which 24 vehicles collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, did not have a chronic illness, and it was found that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki, slightly injuring 12 people.
The police arrested Nomura Katsuya (54), who was driving the trailer, on suspicion of causing the first rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the public prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to move forward without hitting the brakes after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to a person involved in the investigation, Nomura did not have a chronic illness, and it was found that some kind of carelessness may have been the cause.
The police have raided the house of the person concerned and are investigating the circumstances at the time in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-Release NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started with 3 volumes, is now complete with these 4 volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume, which covered everything from the opening game to the semifinals, this one focuses on just one game, so it's full of new gimmicks!
●"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review submitted by Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●Superhuman pro wrestling has already begun before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are a thorough and careful depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to note is that this does not mean that they are only about the match in the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, it's been hard to get into the game because of the mutual rivalry and the special training, but it's never been boring.
This feeling during the story, in which the tension gradually increases as the battle of the century is about to begin, is surely connected to the heightened tension of the reader, and I can't help but admire the fact that even this period is a very calculated production.
And before the important final, there's one more event you can't miss: Terry Man vs. Ramen Man, the third-place playoff.
Aside from the fact that it's gorgeous as a match card, my favorite part is when the ramen man says to the poster of Kinnikuman backstage before the match, "Now it's my turn to aim!! "
and tries to slam the chops down.
However, a terryman who happened to be passing by stopped him by picking up his sword, stared at him without saying a word, and they parted ways just like that.
What's so amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, so they don't have a chance to fight a tough guy in this tournament.
But there's this kind of agonizing over the mystery man.
When I'm shown something like this, I can't help but think about my achievements in the distant future!
As a manga artist, this is a scene that still makes me keenly aware of what it means for a character to stand up!
The fight between the two ends without much of a fight, but the famous scene is the tearful appeal of the ramen man after the match.
"Don't just rely on the strength of your miraculous luck!"
That's the line.
Would you call this a grand meta-statement about the work itself? Up until now, I think readers have been quietly feeling that, after all, Kinnikuman can't lose because he's the main character, and that he's somehow getting the upper hand in areas that aren't his strength.
But by getting the ramen man to make this statement, the boiled egg teacher has convinced himself that he can't use the wrong hand.
With this one sentence, the reader is left wondering, "So, Kinnikuman doesn't actually defeat Robin?
How? "
You will be able to stir up your imagination for the future development, and if you look at it from a writer's point of view, this is a line that the boiled egg teacher who makes the work has imposed on himself.
I thought this was an amazing thing to do.
I think that's definitely one of the big points of this book.

Winter illumination weekend held at Aobayama, Takahama-cho (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first winter illumination has begun at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, and the park is bathed in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illumination, which began on November 26, features a 20-meter-tall camphor tree interspersed with 50,000 LED bulbs along with walking paths and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised to find a place like this.
It's beautiful and it's a relief," she said.
The illumination was planned for the first time in an attempt to provide relief while avoiding crowding, and will be lit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
There will also be a Christmas event on the 25th, the last day, with a button hotpot and a movie screening.

(In fact, it's more applicable and easier to understand if you learn from Linux or something like that than if you suddenly come into contact with something highly abstract like docker.
It's quite tough to get out of that and suddenly understand everything.
I wish I could understand...
You don't have to do it in order.
In addition, instead of memorizing the contents, they seem to remember only what they skipped before and read it when necessary.
I didn't start reading anything until I had to break it down in practice, and then I read it over and over again, so I gradually got into it.

Online distribution, agricultural and livestock product PR, sponsored by the Agricultural Promotion Association, broadcast live from Yonezawa |Yamagata Newspaper
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which is made up of municipalities and JA in the Okitama region, promoted agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," which sells products while streaming videos on the internet.
Yamagata Ai no Bushotai made a remote appearance on the "Nationwide Collaboration MINATO (Minato) Market TV," which was planned for the first time by Minato Ward, Tokyo, and delivered the charms of the region along with local products.
The opening of the store was decided as a result of the "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," a collaborative effort between the Okitama region and Minato Ward, and was broadcast live from Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara-shinmachi, Yonezawa.
Kuroda Mika, who is active as a "Satoyama sommelier," wore a Yonezawa-ori brand "nitorito" stole and introduced the attractions of the area surrounded by nature.
We also reported on the imoni party with Ai no Bushotai.
At the Tokyo studio, comedian Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tampopo" and YouTubers with more than 300,000 subscribers sampled Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, and more.
When telling viewers how delicious it is," "The smell comes across even though it's live," and "Lots of things that are delicious with alcohol are the best" were some of the rave comments.

this morning's misfortune...
My NAS PC won't turn on anymore<unk>
~What happened~
1.) In the morning, open the windows for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) When I came back to the room a little later, I noticed that the PC was making a sound like a pink rotor, so I shut it down for a moment.
At this point, I thought that the fan movement was only getting worse due to the drop in room temperature (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Does not start.
When the power button is pressed, the power light comes on for a moment and the fan moves, but stops immediately.
After that, they don't say a word.
I unplugged it and tried again, but it still only turned on for a split second.
4.) Connect the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pin only, remove the other parts and try without starting.
5.) I suspect that PSU is the cause because there have been times before when PSU fans have been hitting something and making a buzzing sound.
I'll try to find a spare ATX power supply at a later date.
maybe.
If not... what should I do?
Should I change the case and the mother together...

Emojis are essential for the soft atmosphere that is so valuable in modern communication!
So, what kind of emojis do people use?
[See all images] The most used emojis in 2021 Top 10 most used emojis in the world in 2021!
Overall, positive and bright emojis are in the rankings.
According to the original Unicode, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
The number one emoji accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
The first, third, and fifth crying-laughing emojis are very easy to use.
When it's funny, when I'm happy, of course, I did it!
I think there are many people who use it in a self-deprecating way, even when they feel helpless.
On the other hand, those who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are rare.
I want that style to continue.

What about the punishment of personal computers and peripheral devices?
* PC farms
I've only brought it in once, but even though it's in Misato, Saitama, they won't collect it from Saitama for free.
(Free if you are relatively new)
* Inverse nets
I've never used it, but Sagawa seems to be completely free for delivery and shipping.
I'm thinking about using it, so if anyone knows about it, I'd love to hear what they think.
Coarse and large garbage, etc. (Toll), Addition> Municipal collection box (Small home appliances free)
* Sell it secondhand.
Postscript: Mercari, hard off
I wonder if there are people who sell used PCs at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It may be a wise choice to sell while you can make money.
* Additional information provided by Linnet Japan: /u/CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers and old UPSs that no one will take back are getting in the way.
It's not the size of a large garbage can, so it probably won't cost me any money, but somehow I've been put off.
I collect coins as a hobby.
Can you tell me how much this coin is worth?
Foreign coins are worthless. . .
Banknotes are exchanged in Japan, but coins are not.
If it's a commemorative gold coin, it has value because it contains gold.
There are times when you don't like someone even though they haven't done anything wrong, right?
Yes, it is natural to have likes and dislikes because we are human.
"I don't like something (for no reason)", that's what people who don't like things are like.

Trial campaign underway
She can't, but is she being discriminated against because of her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that it can be decided by appearance.
Because you can't show the inside.
What did you do with your school tracksuit after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Yome used to wear room wear until we started living together lol
Is it possible for a person to become a rear admiral at any time, even after the age of 90 or 100?

Men's volleyball advanced to the final tournament for the first time in 29 years! / Men's fencing freer did not win a medal in 4th place
Ryujin Nippon advances to the quarterfinals for the first time in 29 years! Japan men's volleyball team advances to final T. Coach Nakagakiuchi: "It was a big goal"
I thought it was bad when the third set was taken with the referee challenge x2, but I won the full set.
Fencing men's fleur-de-lis team loses to U.S. instead of Japan medal
I think they were better than their semi-final opponents, but why are they in the third place play-off?
I would like to plant a blindfold tree in my garden. Please let me know if you have any recommended trees.
I would prefer an evergreen tree that is easy to care for and, if possible, bears fruit.
I look forward to working with you.
If you want feijoas to bear fruit, plant other fruit-bearing trees nearby, such as olives, blueberries or plums.
How much of each other's savings do you need to live together?
To each his own.
It also depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better not to live together.
There's a good chance they'll break up.
It is better to make a proper matchmaker, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal events, and have a wedding ceremony and reception.
Cohabitation has no benefits.
I think it's better if you don't...
I went to the arcade today and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Gunbar Rising.

I think it's an ant.
