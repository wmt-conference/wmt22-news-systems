In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
According to the agency, the participants of the event, kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military arrived at the site to disperse the equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now russian equipment has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
This square is now, like the building, controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against rally participants and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor in the Donetsk region.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, the Russian invaders kidnap the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson a special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelenskyy: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and again occupy the de-occupied territories.
Quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äì we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have pulled back a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, then we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Zelenskyy also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something ‚Äì and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äì but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there are no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts became needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
of the Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to enter the analysis of the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Everyone Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in bucha," the message says.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from the Russian invaders.
Massacres of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other again, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was waiting for with sadness is happening...
I removed children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment I had no doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the execution case of his great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence to death is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-court" nobility, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived in hamlets and had several cows was enough to doom the pahar and the breadwinner of young children to execution.
Relatives did not even find out about the burial place.
The grandmother said that nearly a hundred people were then taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give perjury were killed.
In the criminal case there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was the KDBist informant.
An apple from an apple tree is not far away, as you know, falling...
The firing trio that doomed the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources like the "Immortal Barracks" in Russia, which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers were first discredited and then destroyed by the system.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were imprisoned for it, and died quickly there.
KDBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
On top of the thousand-year Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed.
And then, on what happened, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" of 1992, that's how it was.
Zo you saw my photos in a swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what can I buy for coughing .
Sorry because I don't have anyone to ask

According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant on the Boxer armored personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is it us in the first half of the day, or in the afternoon together?

Maybe I can be useful to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up the mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also really hope so
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, at the stop 402 of the bus, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where reciprocity felt my heart.

I didn't go. Yes, she baked herself.  I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers at Babyn Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings at Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans have been seeing it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song to you on the night
We agree, agree for a tour, and write when to be collected
Everyone was sick only Lydia did not get sick in them was omicron a new type of covid

Serhii Sydorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries - for the late supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its aspirations for membership in the Alliance due to russia's position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Oath Questions", together with the editor of "European Pravda", we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia,  may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner marked that my Application is pending.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I wondered if I really needed to look at it differently.
And he invited me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "they have not done this before"
Konashenkov's quote: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
The Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down by Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of a downed rocket of the occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles utterly destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians were planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of russia in order to blame Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" allegedly fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are thrown into a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe's largest cities, Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of strength, touching and a time of despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, vacations.

It clings to the old reality.
You call to work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it's not for long.
Now.... will agree... something will happen.
Mozog refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I don't have anyone and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. Everything that was we spent at home.
Many people are happy leaders in our jobs did not give wages.
Where should I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for children ? Where should I live ?
You don't have the ability to take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from home... you go 1000 kilometres.
You do not know whether you will have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What's next ? Unknown. How much so ? Not known. Children ask for sweets. And you can't . It's expensive for you.

These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first-aid kits to the front.

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (HEI of Ukraine) is a constituency that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located. [1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas Constituency is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national votes are held in the Foreign Constituency: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.

Very tasty apples, what is this variety?
Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak said that Russia was launching a "fake operation" on weapons that the allies were handing us over.
Yermak's quote: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "bring down" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense system transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the Allies, and they are massively switching to the Russian army.
I want to immediately prevent such fakes.
Because the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively sends the enemy to the next world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed these reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements followed reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian troops who had left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depicted the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia's Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an "investigation" on charges of Ukraine disseminating "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelenskyy said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw the bodies of alleged civilians on the streets of a small town.
In only one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äì all in civilian clothes ‚Äì were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed from close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kiev that had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: There is no Kyiv." How the occupiers vilely exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äì the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrayinska Pravda" found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" takes place and whether there are ways to return to the Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, removed children without parents from there, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true Plast members, Denis and Marina packed alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24th.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke both not Russian and not Ukrainian came into the entrance.
They ask: "Who is there?" ‚Äì I say that yes. - "Come out!".
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (who commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all equally Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" ‚Äì they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want a war, ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, loot.
Chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other ‚Äì their white tape and called it "militia".
In Ukraine, they arrived completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have what, artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know each other among themselves, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They delivered 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktar.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so many thousands in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us ‚Äì either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äì it was about Bucha, Hostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, possibly, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äì either with Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to the motherland ‚Äì they say, "you will be shot there, they will be sold to the organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar", we passed an improvised control, many were completely undocumented, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! A rocket shoots, and a trace is visible ‚Äì iskander worked in Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I am a khokhol, I am from Chernigov.
But I believe that Putin with Lukashenko is not established, –ø–æ–∫–∞ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö –≤–∞—à–∏—Ö –≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤ –Ω–µ dobe—å—é—Ç.
Bad people suffer!
And here Lukashenko is so good!
He said, so be it."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents ‚Äì my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.
In the sanatorium they did not keep it by force.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw ballistic missile launches across Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozyr said that Russians there were constantly shooting from training grounds.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was drafted.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their landfills are used to shell Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags now as Estonian flags."
Maryna lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to ‚Äì the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, somewhere in the center you will not be able to ?
Thank you, we always have everything.
Thanks for the arrangement, the bloodworms are good
And in this small apartment wifi does not catch, basically I answer all your questions and now I don't know how to be?And children have online classes from Monday, but there is no Internet.

Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were juveniles.
The headman of the village of Motyzhin Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were abducted on March 23, were found killed and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway, 20km from Kyiv, the bodies of several were found wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, then there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes "European Pravda".
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
When asked if Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war after all," he added.
To recap, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine a new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very rich man, After a while he called and reported that he had undergone heart surgery.

He was a very rich man and believed that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me
"There was a car in my yard, it looked like a crocodile, and I was letting hailstones.

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and radio' was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to blurt out too much when they call."
"For a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law the info about the war.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, Speck (cat ‚Äì UP) has fur peeled off on the belly and hind legs ‚Äì it can be from stress, changes in food and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The speck, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Poleva took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
Both the war and the fact that I was nearby were hidden from it ‚Äì formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver ‚Äì she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always at the bedside.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She doesn't hear well ‚Äì it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. It's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk to her about anything, just not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have a cleaning of 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I somehow didn't think about it :)

A Briton who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC citing Eislin's family members and friends, Atlas News, citing the words of Eislin's friend who spoke to him
According to Eislin's tweet: "We received news from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the soldier's mother, En Wood, and she confirmed that her son said by phone that they planned to surrender.
Military friend Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in a recent phone call, Eislin said of their unit's plans to surrender.
The brigade ran out of ammunition and food, he said.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intended to surrender to Russian units so as not to fall into the hands of so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
An audio recording of a telephone conversation was also distributed on social networks, in which Eislin allegedly speaks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he left to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin was called Johnny by friends and relatives, and on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

On the streets there were always bodies tortured by the Bolsheviks

When you can bring things
Your tradition is very interesting, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere."
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the sphere of economy turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the draft law believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äì it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
One that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "soars" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take off ‚Äì for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the start of the war and bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 most likely will not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
People's deputy, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of him.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in UKROBORONPROM, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in UKROBORONPROM, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate one or another defense enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro also gives arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts at the very first word "war" leave Ukraine back in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
Firstly, it is a manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 children with me.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, an enhanced curfew for 2 days will be introduced.
Pavlyuk's quote: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew was strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the Regional State Administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

Serbia's defence budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the predictions of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyo Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the forceful support of special forces "SOBR", three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to Viasna, during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical attention on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the Railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of the BZD and the administrator of the thematic resources of BZD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, according to @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
To recap: The BYpol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus as part of the Peramog plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, the Russian Federation transfers through Belarus to fight, Ukraine manpower and equipment.

The United States bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision made by more than 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector output includes manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step in the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
The sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they hold in the United States.

My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant at SkyUp, my mother was a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchik went to kindergarten.

Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispensa, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Natalia Nahorna, a journalist with the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social networks that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command has a connection with the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, for now we will stay here
2 driving hours )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
That's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here
A squadron ofüá®üáø Czech drones has started flights over Ukraine sinceüá∫üá¶ today.
Nearly 50 professional coptersüöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them to directly destroy the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to the Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of the https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones as intended: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to use copters as efficiently and safely as possible, we will keep their locations secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything was fine. I love sweets, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have time. Lots of luggage.

But do not feel sorry for the destroyed houses, sorry for the people who are bullied by the invaders
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore off the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore down portraits of heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.

How do I get credited the day that I wasn't at work there is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "It is not excluded that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of personnel of units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, servicemen are recruited from the specified brigade.
The enemy experiences a particular problem when manning the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue strikes on transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the ORLAN-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Zolote area, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
With the forces of some units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopolya, Trudoliubovka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repulsed four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to make it, but I doubt it
And you as much as you can sleep want and I hold you
you definitely don't mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thanks. We didn't watch TV at home, much less 1+1. No need for us to set up :)
I turn on the TV here solely to listen to czech language
I am running out of a monthly rate package today :)
Can we do it by phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
My father and I will meet later, be sure to üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook ,then apparently Google wroteüèµÔ∏è something in its own way. , think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we took the things that you brought, but there are things that are small for us you can bring them in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then I can start going to work from next week because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if it gets there, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working at Teva
Friends are old and not so much, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I've talked to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what they Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later," Sasha replied succinctly as usual. ‚Äì Now, after the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of a very few of you ‚Äì those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places ‚Äì how many of you have done at least something to resist this regime?
Except perhaps for participating in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feeling of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which have now probably placed a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to some extent ‚Äì messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year than 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, you are eventually overwhelmed by such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the back of the tsar, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel that it's safer near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans from the Stasi did, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument ‚Äì and allowed the KGB to lie down, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option ‚Äì and dutifully accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
As he began to level Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum Kalah and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased a new home and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is that the trouble?
Moscow shone festively and glistened with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed ‚Äì Yuriy Shchekochykhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äì many of you were shocked and terrified of what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything at all.
A bit of outrage, a bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia blatantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin swapped places with Medvedev again and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was already too much, and you went to protests en masse.
Navalny's name became a household name, you had not left the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan and never left it again.
They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, reinforcement and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose leaders on their own and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin didn't like Maidan very much.
This was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere, a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his puck suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find the reason because right after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely as new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binbegs, public Waifai and hipster cafes.
In truth, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly didn't understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I myself saw state snipers shooting at my children's peers in cold blood on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
"At first they came for socialists, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for members of trade unions, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent ‚Äì because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done so.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äì such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for the others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with Ukrainians ‚Äì or, which seems very likely, if he fails ‚Äì he will take it up for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely but mostly went out alone to protest and still served a short time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given simply for an anecdote are not in such a distant past ‚Äì and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äì even more so than in 2014 ‚Äì frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing on paper his superiority may be.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
Therefore, be on the alert.
You understand what everything is going to.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hohma, your laws, except for the repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there remains another one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, less will be required of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and is much more afraid of these people than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äì the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized can be created.
There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300 thousand come out, she will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them into in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be afraid in your place too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but are really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äì and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet ‚Äì and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äì and die in a damp cell under police dubs.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and will only continue to intensify, becoming larger and larger.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's going to end.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be at home
That you perceive me as a press secretary
vico, how often do you go to dinner at an expensive restaurant?
once on the rtik I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked the very beautiful one and we wanted something more so it is the best option
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I'm tired energetically.
I feel bad, cough, fever, voice disappeared, weakness and my head is spinning
I have to go to that government of labor
We have already done this,but said who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month
On Thursday, you need a pass, we go with the children to the doctor.
But at night I was written by one lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I expect new news from her and I will definitely inform her.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought that I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.

I walked into natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to pick up the child because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery yesterday opened our children's room until 19:00.
Could this really be the case?
Working time of the room is until 16:00.
And in the end, it's our responsibility.
