The great return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough time in his career in recent months, is heading back to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalie for Litvinov, Plzen and Chelyabinsk in Russia was injured in preparation for the NHL this October.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on NHL ice since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalie was moving from one stick to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to goaltending in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning U.S. time, where he played four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he posted a 94.5% save percentage.
The Pilsen-born hockey player wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had problems with his hips last year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "The Frenchman" has played 36 games and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's veil on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also posted his wish, using a photo of him helping his daughter Camille put on a veil at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, associates and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, as are Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not specify who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The image, which serves as a Christmas card, was also posted by heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at Ascot Racecourse in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and face veil, helps Camilla put on her veil colour-coordinated with her bright dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in a current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was promised CZK 1 million by Prague-based Slavia for the 2018/19 league title.
The server efotbal.cz reported this, adding that it had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, said that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt acts.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretaps, which mainly feature Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berber and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berber a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the first league title.
The police had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia's chairman Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial benefits to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdik.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer in any of football's positions.
Like former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, he was released from custody in mid-January.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the cold war.
The guns will be new, but basically of an inferior type (gunners have to get out of armored cabs and carry rounds by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they've managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent but at the end of their lease, transport- too small with short range but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we have none at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
SAMs: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have this story.
I have a chase right next to town.
There were nutria coming out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I went there to sit.
When I walked in, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came up, but sure enough, a fox went after a while.
I let it come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got down from my perch he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has these days.
So get somewhere visible, put your expensive stuff in a sleeping bag at your feet and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior Ministry got the respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of respirators, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases made by each ministry and found that in a single day the amounts spent on respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which ministries behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We don't even have large stores of equipment for the trained to seize, we don't really have modern equipment even for existing professionals, plus modern equipment is getting more complex so the skills of reservists will rapidly diminish over time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts where anyone can deploy them will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla, and a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
The only time we will fight on Czech territory is in a conflict of this scale and intensity, where a gerilla is irrelevant, and we don't even have the geography to do so.
We mainly don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then you watch a guy who missed an empty net 2 minutes ago go on the offensive alone between 2 or 3 Swiss and go, "what do you think is gonna happen now?"
Well, of course he's gonna get taken for the average taxpayer.
The "bring on the defender" situation is so horrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our striker managed to outrun one opposing player.
The first swallows
Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal for the next weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time and, as is well known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it may cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired through previous exposure to the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon also entered the covida equation this week on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And it is soon to be complemented by Pfizer's paxlovide, which reports a success rate of 85 per cent so far.
But the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for the incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company also ended up on the tape first because the drug began development long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease in horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
In contrast, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown".
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you without hesitation that they do not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Ono in France alone Le Pen and Zemmour, both polling over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so the soldiers don't have to relearn where what is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want nuclear warheads on their own territory, either for security reasons or the speed of warhead deployment due to the more westerly location.
Those underground shelters ( there are two in each maple tree) only held warheads not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy that weapon, a special unit came and retrieved that warhead and mounted it on some sort of launcher.
Except for the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate condition.
In the second grade of primary school we had a classmate who was a gypsy, we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often came and wanted to explain things, he missed little, came regularly, played sports with us, didn't steal lunches or phones, came cleanly dressed.
He also went to outdoor schools, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, his siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, threatening and menacing the other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something on an advert (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and have often sold to gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't make any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself..
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes along, reaches out, trashes apartments and houses, just messes around, makes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, they're going to bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, as long as they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene despite resuscitation care," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, went into the opposite direction at a curve.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being freed, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted in a stable condition to the hospital in České Budějovice, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU parcels, customers often fail to provide details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and give the post office his customs details.
He receives an email telling him that customs is expecting a package to arrive.
He then just needs to fill in the details of the parcel and if the trader has not already included VAT in the sale, customs will charge it on the total amount of the parcel and the shipping costs.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I tick one or two boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
But not all deliveries go smoothly.
Because of new customs rules, the number of daily shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests to provide the information needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
For example, we see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and petrol, do you think this is the way to go?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
For example, how much of a raise did you get (who is an employee)?
I got a 2% gross raise this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven convicted rapists are only put behind bars for even 6 months?
This just boggles my mind, how the court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victim reporting?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He called them to her himself.
But he took a roundabout way of doing it.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
The officers, after calling the emergency number, reached the spot and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made it all up so that the officers would come to the spot.
In reality, he only wanted the officers to advise him on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
On checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, under a nationwide search, and had a warrant out for her arrest.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not Slavic ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme of course, too bad Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague for the US :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
I personally wouldn't consider such a case to be a true belief.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose then?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
After all, even the Ten Commandments say there is no god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of those thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed will send me to hell or some such place for it?
Other: voluntary training followed by inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If one does well one can get a pro offer.
All branches of the Army could use something like that.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: There is constant mention of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only when we grow up, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
There should be a similar blending between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you see NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is trouble.
Oh, my goodness.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already proven that all they have to do is show their backs and they'll take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long run as a guarantor of independence is an armed to the teeth army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of its time.
And every teenager today can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what's not to like.
We don't need border fortifications, that's shit today, but a pimply teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in the box tsunami
Unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home overwhelmed with boxes and stuffing?
This "waste" is once again being used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it's a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to a participating shop (the KAMsNIM.cz map contains nearly 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overflowing blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and the money saved, as packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50% in recent years.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, this also strengthens their brand.
One of these shops is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use all of them for packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the app www.KAMsNIM.cz does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to dispose of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, old electrics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
This way, all the rubbish can end up in the right place, plus reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
"It gradually adds collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron's presentation of the priorities of the French EU presidency - starting in January - before the weekend was spectacular.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they are impossible to do in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And France will hold new head of state elections in April.
The electoral calendar has affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is more concerned to prevent history being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is now going around France saying that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is having some success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and ignore what's going on in France.
Wouldn't there be a need for one?
Students in European countries are often taught history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated who in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they no longer learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" didn't win.
The story, which harkens back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for directing and best actress for Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it topped the audience rankings.
Best Actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the regular flu, it was worse.
I don't get diarrhea with the flu.
(Just a personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, to be published on December 20, will include the traditional literary supplement.
And along with it will come cultural tips.
We are enclosing the book ones for you, the subscribers, in addition to this digital edition, so that you will have enough time to buy books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow on from a previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another serving of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with unusual poetic insight, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose work, photographer Šesták has attempted to capture the essence of small towns and Czech society.
It is a story about a return to one's roots, which turns out to be a longed-for illusion.
The bohemian and comparatist translates the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.
Her rendition surpasses the folk versions in brutality and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the road back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental tale of return from emigration than we have become accustomed to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it worth living together.
Trains are starting to run according to a new timetable, and in some places the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains on the railway will start running according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route will be slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, ČD plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections daily, of which 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also see the railways running services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be deployed in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
Railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will be replaced by ČD here after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 daily services on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned closure works.
The operation of trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change trains on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of ČD.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare.
As with ČD, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil and die.
I've never in my life heard teaching from the slave party's perspective or from that time, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
No one even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
No one teaches you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, right in the schools, both the more northern schools and the southern schools.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happening before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are pretty taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to pass judgement without the perspective of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good accomplishments of their own, and I find it absurd to dismiss them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better than a lot of people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and a lot of things went against them too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately leave out some facts, lie and manipulate, plus for example our perspective doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT where they shut down someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, those students were pretty radicalized and the schools encouraged them in so many ways.
And to think that these people are going to be a lot older someday, it makes me a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it should have and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's become radicalised.
Nowadays, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are labelled as feminists, so are other groups like LGBT, and it leads to radicalisation on the other side too, where it often leads to resistance even on quite sensible things.
Plus the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery either.
More like I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Plus, I find the concept of nationality in general to be useless in terms of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people it is interests, world views and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovakian parish priest is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always yells some bullshit about the coronavirus that puts everyone to shame.
Then of course there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they're Protestant, but in reality they were born out of Catholic Modernism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to services with the Hussites because it's theologically very similar, but the members tend to be more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square is under the Dominicans and they even do a Mass there every Sunday at 3:00 pm in Latin, like they did before Vatican II.
The crib from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flamingo lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna to get it this time because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Breclav.
They also took it at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the troop, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouts take the train to Vienna to collect it.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, 18 December, by Scout couriers who will travel on selected express and passenger trains.
Local Scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations and will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
Also this year, the Scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
This is similar to last year.
We are giving recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear veils, of course, try to keep the spacing as low as possible, not to sing colleagues, just behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and tranquillity along with the flame.
For believers, the Bethlehem Light is a symbol of hope, of light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can pick up the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the basic economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer on the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology(e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and it crashes the free market and the "natural life of a company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-funded by xy project" signs in the corridors and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when that company is somehow holding on and taking contracts/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's demise
I totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age gets caught in a trick or trap too - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don't move me, but then I still catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always avoid it.
That's also why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to put a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all crap, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internets.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mostly in) point 1:
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I will claim is cryptic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has bucked the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Movie theaters, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, premiering a record-breaking two hundred-plus of them to their audiences this year.
The operator of the IMDb movie database has done the math.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring points with audiences in recent years and has seen a significant increase in viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
Four times more Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb only includes in its total those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so realistically there will be many more festive films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales in particular are associated with the season, while popular films worldwide include Home Alone, Love in Heaven and the 1946 classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful.
However, the real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special series of films, the BBC reminded.
Its Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers in on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter that much, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"It's a form of escape for the audience and a way to feel a little bit of peace, at least for two hours, in the midst of all the holiday madness and craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
He said Hallmark Television, for example, uses the same formula for its films, which, while uniform, is successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's some misunderstanding about a half hour before the end, but it's resolved and the two kiss.
It's like that over and over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he will not be involved in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for covid-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place that he took in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of Haas will not be racing in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from last place and Max Verstappen from first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and showing no symptoms, according to a statement from the Haas stable.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
That's because any replacement would have to complete qualifying or drive in another part of the weekend.
The first driver is not struggling with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for covid-19 at the start of the season just ending, and last year Sergio Pérez or Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can get arrested for that, too.
And nobody will give a shit that the boss said
Legally, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
In the same category as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhoid.

"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in my home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his piece over six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France and the 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds softness to the sweater," the designer praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
The engineers, scouts and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish counterparts protect the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in the wake of months of action by the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries into its territory with the false promise of easy crossings of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Omikron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspected variant reported in another child from Adamov, from a preparatory class.
There is no direct contact with the previous cases from the Adamov primary school," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that the cases are two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of the cases have mild symptoms and four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected of having Omicron has travelled abroad
None of the people mentioned had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had there been any contact with anyone abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championships for any of those named, Ciupek said.
Earlier, chief sanitary officer Pavla Svrčinová said the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
Players from South Africa were there and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict arms sales.
It wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain guns in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court opinion upholding Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
But the court was now deciding not the constitutionality of the entire law, but a technical question arising from the measure's innovative design.
Indeed, the enforcement of the ban in this case was delegated to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in the usual court of law.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed Texas' ban on most abortion services to stand, and largely endorsed Texas' maneuver to protect its law," California Gov.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would empower members of the public to enforce bans on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is a term for homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (more than CZK 220,000) and court costs from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for "ghost guns" or kits to make them.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said California Gov.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban here in June as unconstitutional.
If the state were now to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned against extending that legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing select officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where they gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also make improvements to the vaccines themselves based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4th dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, there will be a vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to be on the market shortly, and according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland has threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
Ziobro said the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw down €36 billion from the EU's fund to rebuild economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also reconsider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles", Ziobro also said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on rule by the most powerful and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would result in a reduction of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
But to know herself... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yoghurt more than once too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they had all the selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If there's an avoidance, I won't even go to any market anymore, no action, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
Lidl to take my holiday.

Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day, y'all.
I was punished with a boil when I was a kid.
It was never for grades, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the cooker and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a couple of whacks on my bottom (through my clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishment (when done reasonably and in moderation) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than words.
I think the warning part is important, because in a way it gives the child the choice of disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not getting the punishment.
For me, in the end, mostly just the warning was enough to get me to listen.
Defending the system
In 1999, when Vojtěch Cepl, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, answered a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document sworn to and taught at school, or an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he was strongly inclined towards the former.
Once we have agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a country and its citizens, it is better to be sparing with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just like Czechs like pork and cabbage dumplings, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its authors (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, for example with the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies across history have faced.
A constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians their power.
Covid does not choose, in the Brno hospital they are fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novosti.
The course is usually much simpler, easier, and often without symptoms.
However, there are paediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," Dominik said.
The doctor said there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place in the pediatric infectious disease clinic.
The really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ARU.
Children with post-coronary syndromes have been on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects adolescents as well as several-month-old babies, in addition to adults.
Hospitals are also seeing children in a severe condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, we have children of several months and adolescent age lying in our hospital," the chief minister said.
However, he is happy that the Children's Hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths due to coronavirus.
According to available data, as of 6 December, there have been six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward - the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part.
He also points out that, as in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-coronary syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is recommended even in children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You can't ski/bike in the woods outside of marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not policed that much outside of national parks).

China is building the impression of a contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jiroush: China is building the impression of a contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to contain a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are vying for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are helping fight the coronavirus in many places, including in hardest-hit Italy.
What is the perception of Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend of a friend meets a friend of a friend and says, hey, you want an elephant?
I got one and it's awesome.
My wife likes it because it cuts the grass, washes the car with its trunk, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
I'll sell you an elephant for 5,000 if you want.
Friend: All right, let's high-five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: "Dude, what kind of elephant did you sell????
The lawn's trashed, there's giant shit everywhere, the car's trashed, the kids are scared of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says: you talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
World events are dominated by the superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, this is working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century the mood will be different and it will happen.
I thought of that too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm being wordy.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines" makes it clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that the American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So in other words, I expect it's already included in that broad term and there's no need to specify further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just being wordy :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical requirement

Britain's Vicki Holland tortures Milly the cosmos monkey
Horrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it down the toilet and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, with no regard for its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified cosman.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon again.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and ordered to pay an estimated £12,000 in court costs.
Small Monkeys team leader who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
For a long time the monkey refused even to eat.
Even now that she is settled and comfortable with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will always follow her, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat on drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her home, £1,600 worth of cocaine (less than £50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
How do you take away the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, with honourable exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
As long as you get an A on the test and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can identify the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't bat an eyelash and tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning it for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't have the need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of the reason it's taught is for the many people who will need that thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all that stuff to stand at the machine, I was totally serious... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elite probably plays a part in this) However, the price of having barbarians standing by our machines is simply high.
If only journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these proportions.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to nosy fans' probing questions about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Things have been sizzling between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move out to see her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri reacted angrily to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's now ex-wife's supposed honesty didn't sit well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things and we never really talked about it much in the family either.
I certainly don't want to cause any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't help it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it the most despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I would dearly like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, reads the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he ended up stealing less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
He then thought of nothing better than to climb to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One of the security cameras then shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana in the process.
When the owner of the apartment woke up the next morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The police subsequently arrested Cao.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and tied in effect to a pandemic alert.
If it's repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections for the four municipal councils.
People voted for new councils on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected councils broke up.
A total of 99 candidates ran for a total of 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and especially the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said Eva Krumpová, the deputy chair of the CSO.
She recalled that the covid-19 epidemic made the elections more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
Jana Křižková, the current mayor of the municipality, who is a member of the Private Party, also won re-election to the council on their behalf.
The Komňans - independent candidates won one seat on the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovná association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the re-run elections in Lužice in Most.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The Municipality for the People candidate came second, with 43.27 per cent of voters giving it their vote, so it will have three representatives on the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves won the elections in Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened its position compared to the regular elections in 2018, winning one more seat and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff people write here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic standpoint (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I do mind how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, like the 30 years
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have no business together
The man fell upside down from 12 metres.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived the incredible fall on Sunday night, with the help of rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Workers at the regional operations centre received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ambulance crews - medical and paramedic - immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, the paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and landed head first on concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should have, and the fire brigade went into action.
By the time the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further pre-hospital emergency care measures, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma centre for further care, informed the spokesman of the MS Region's Emergency Medical Service, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the front line in the fight against the disease is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Rezac.

The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends his belt
MMA had a great gala night full of interesting results.
For things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found an opponent in seven years.
Lightweight Charles Oliveira didn't falter, showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a win, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
It came in the women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "midget", because Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of the paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peña was not going to be forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with an arm bar herself.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents graced each other with plenty of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena took Nunes to the ground where she began to choke her out.
She had to give up the effort and tap out.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Although Poirier fared better at first, the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, as he tried to hit his opponent with an arm bar.
He was not very successful, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of shots.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost for the first time in two years.
In the next fight, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph by landing a hard right hand on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of accurately aimed punches to record his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to get the better of Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, now losing for the first time in seven years.
The hip or the hip?
On the face of it, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it's no problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a fairly large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they take on double endings and in some cases remain in their uncloned form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "hip" are both masculine and feminine, the former inflected according to the pattern "machine", the latter according to the pattern "song".
Another group of nouns have different forms in the first singular case, for example, "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are spelled the same way, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, as are other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some of the words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally non-cloned, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the word 'image', which is both masculine and feminine, or the word 'bufet', which has remained uncloned in the middle gender but has masculine endings like 'hrad'.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped obstructing them.
European politicians are pledging support to Greece, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, now in their fourth month in Australia, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impact, as critics claim?
And what will the country need to prepare for in the future in the face of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to lock it away.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I do know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how those people are often treated by their neighborhood or even the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who make false accusations.
It's disgusting and a spit in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is awash with half-built houses, families have no money to finish
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a difficult situation.
This is because they do not have the funds to finish their houses under construction and banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also rising.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the houses they have already built.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people are moving into unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year and fifty percent of them have been built.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult in that we have to keep certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are making no profit," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to experience financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house to cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň said.
Of the materials, copper and iron have become the most expensive, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction firms are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic and a pandemic is holding back the influx of foreign workers.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But real visions are missing, says ČRO commentator - mujRozhlas
Apart from the traditional celebrations, the entry into the New Year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
As in, I find the thesis great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
The internship is totally fine here, unless you are a total macaque and have something left in your head, the committee won't choke you on theory unnecessarily.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam and when I was stumped, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I got right away and I got it right.
Otherwise, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do their term project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the course that incorporates the knowledge gained in the project, not just a defense.
All ok but don't flood the emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along, otherwise something might happen to them.
But you might as well put a statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it so that he's grabbing Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing sticks at artists.
Once you don't put up stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Plus they keep changing what feature is more important, whether to like, comment or save.
It's pissing me off terribly lately, so I may have to downgrade to tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my industry have success and barely give a shit.
Eventually I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Donbass Workers' Party
Union - yes, break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Belovezhskaya Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open acquiescence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with a population of almost three hundred million.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has shrunk by ten to eleven million.
Even ignoring the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They have deliberately deindustrialised, put the brakes on agriculture, severed from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first of the socialist camp and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a 'power vacuum'.
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day, mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs CZK 189 per kg.
I buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain discounts it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take things like this to help the temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like, it was good stuff, full of completely unnecessary lectures about how I should wash and not be a pussy.
It's a shame about the paper, they wouldn't have to cut down the forests for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail gets you to comply because you like the person without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she'd break down in tears and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she went nuts.
Then I ended the relationship, telling her I was breaking up and insisting that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and keep her from having another fit.
A man like that sucks the feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better to keep your distance
when insurance companies are rampantly ripping off people who wouldn't even know about this horrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we accomplish is complications for companies, carriers and others because of their employees getting five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the west, they've stopped the shenanigans and recognised that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he has to steal some more and fuel his ego by inventing faggotry.
I see we're getting the good old scumbag back again.
After a few years of decline and suppression of this crooked business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight again.
I was one of the recruiters, I gave it a try (I was 20 years old, freshman in college), the initial promises of product and sales skills training quickly morphed into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering as I wanted to help people, however the training was more on how to scare and talk people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realised that if you wanted to make money, you had to pitch a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made you feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every tip and to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, the managers mind their own business and don't stick their noses in our business.
So regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form it's done here it's quite good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, etc.
Company events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we are a kind of almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us too much as long as there are results.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, 12 December, Jakub Kulhánek, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the resignation, announced on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon the British police confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
In respect of the family, we will not give any more information on the case.
Our condolences, Kulhánek tweeted.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work, before she was due to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
London police subsequently launched a manhunt for her, with Interpol listing her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police had already arrested a man in this connection a few days earlier.
However, it did not disclose what role he was supposed to have played in the case and what it suspects him of.
Four municipalities gifted themselves new councils towards the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region elected new councils.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils broke up.
99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats in the new elections.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won seats.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men ran for 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to the municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
On Monday, the results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease here at the very beginning, but it went off without a hitch.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of much of the population at all levels of the population is something I still have a problem with.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He'd be stripped of the presidency and eligibility to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are very slim as others here mention.
Plus, I'm not sure if the mapping of the dossier could even be considered treason.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who go without sex for a year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who are sex-abstainers rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women aged between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of media, social networking sites and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged between 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among people in marriages, with only 5% saying they had gone without sex in the past year in 2021.
For single people, the figure was 29%. Stone added that married people under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religiosity also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided in their opinion of premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the prevalence of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend caught on especially during the lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of mandating vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a section of the population to engage in behaviour that they do not want but which could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and one on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be to blame for the death of an eighty year old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, heard some misinformation, and as a result didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a die-hard opponent of vaccination, who is here shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
A snow-free Czech Republic.
How will a mild winter play into the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent memory in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizera 50 cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it is not about the pan-bikers.
Once in high school, a teacher took us across town to the boathouse so we could ride boats on the river.
On the way there, we walked down this one fairly wide street and who do we see in the middle - a follower of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily I ran away, but they got into a fight with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are very spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already breaking down, says Orozovic
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki told a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor said the crisis, triggered by worrying Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, as night after night we see hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He has discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene after a while, but another nun was driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her licence for failing to yield the right of way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle had been hit by another nun who had asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her driver's license after finding that she had over two milligrams of alcohol in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
But Juraj Šajmovič has not protected his film.
Czech family comedy filmmakers have looked to American stories about pet dogs.
But in doing so, they forgot one important thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitsch film Gump - The Dog Who Taught People How to Live, another film is now competing for the audience's emotions.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. is loosely following his previous film, Here I Watch, from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some familiar characters return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Sumava guesthouse, which is failing and so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmović (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the narrative techniques in their previous dog film, but there at least the children and the dog had fun.
This time, the creative duo have written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, though a scientist, succumbs to the darker delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates specify - on the hood of a car or a church steeple (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), Mojmír, a retired colonel, despite his years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the woods, who falls into a coma, whereupon she is taken by her family to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude with a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing healing of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed to convey this message.
A pair of female staff thieves, a dog-walking contest, a Sumava charlatan, cops arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs the fertilising power of bone meal - which the drunken family at the guesthouse, of course, get drunk on.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and sits, toned and made-up, with a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and flakka as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the filmmakers explain to the viewer that "sometimes that happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a sense of character and punchline, and directorial direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parts, they don't have much to play.
The only positive point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a couple of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters commit.
Nor is years of membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the lady producer - an argument.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and human-dog friendship, there must be a knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and minimal sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from exactly the kind of morons you are.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here it's obvious you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to these kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore more of an exception.
That's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas setting, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests that are at stake, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water managers warned of drought long ago.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be less rainfall," predicted Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tankers on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders are up seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," reported tanker driver Imad Suleiman in September.
Clashes have erupted between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely without water.
The region has experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said that talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington that preparations were under way for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is staying in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a news conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna have made "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing them."
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
I eventually found out that my suspicions of a pyramid scheme were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady with more doubts and questions for a while and finally said thank you and left.
Call me a punk, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers hit the mountains this weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators are not complaining about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people hit the cross-country trails and the slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers were favoured by the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Jested Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the period after contracting covid-19.
René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We have only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales shops are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokisova from Skiopava in Opava.
She expects more traffic during ski courses.
David Šinták, the managing director of Snowbear in Hradec Kralove, also feels that there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be because of the covid.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost out of rentals.
Compared to before the pandemic, we're at about 50 percent, Shintak told the Czech News Agency.
He said people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learnt to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental shop in the Novako complex in Bozi Dar is seeing a high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested in renting skis now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the resort.
She said there is also interest in the ski school, which is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of a company really doesn't just go abroad.
But I agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started because one fine day Orban won, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the elections in general.
If life is going to be bad here, some traditional V4k lunatic might as well win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on a plane will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury or is it make-up for the sake of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor, from the Lambeth police department where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech left work at around 7:45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by a co-worker on December 3.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the message continued.
MP Harriet Harman, who raised Srncova's case during a press conference on Saturday, is also urging the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case and he remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of doing.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. approx 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
These are not "huge numbers" but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to the situation in 38 is off on so many points I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it wasn't going to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, they will affect mainly suburban connections
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will have to face several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will start running on the route from Beroun to Český Brod through the Prague Central Station.
The R17 fast train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
The PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among others, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go as far as Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 runs via Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimon and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation on ten local lines in Central Bohemia has been cancelled or restricted, among others to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague is being extended, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for food is to go next door to Billy's or a little further down the road to Lidl.
Since I don't get any exercise after work I don't have the energy to exercise so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most pizza buns and for snack yoghurt and apple.
Question: what healthy, uncooked food would you recommend I buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you do, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And it's not the trees you necessarily need to see.
Only the tip of the tree may be hiding under the snow.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved's relationship.
The famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She says he hit on her, not the other way around.
For three days they have been the centre of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it's jumping out of the can, or us, whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's as if some of you want an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or if you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedved is a long-time vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They only came out now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana had been separated for three years, but had only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are only human too, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband too, and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said all the essentials, just confirming that dorms are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends within the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which I find to be the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments aren't usually advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it definitely doesn't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc. are pretty bad addresses), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it's close to most of the faculties of the BUT (I don't know where exactly you're getting in).
So I've never looked for a rent, but I'm a native Brnoer, so I can possibly advise you about Brno as such, if you're still missing some information :)
But that's an example of completely "normal" thinking to me.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or let them go by the state and the state will pay for it.
We can't let a private actor take over a piece of the education system just because he throws in a few crowns on top of the full state contribution and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier made such a statement about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in the town square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've experienced when cataloguing/digitising that they (even long-time professionals) either throw it away by eye somehow, or write something along the lines of xxx *** or ... (depending on convention) and put in a note that it's illegible.
Truth is, in this case it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you could look in some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character to match what's physically on the coin.
P.S. Isn't that more of an Odryan empire (kingdom) than an Odryan one?
PSS: someone already broke it down for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse embarrassment than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood a text is laughable.
All the important documents that are approved are examined word for word; some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relations.
Plus, it's quite interesting about the English language, after the UK left the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Ceylon.
This is my third year working there and I'm totally fine.
Many times I drive from work I 10 pm and never any problem.
Only someone who has hardly set foot there in his life can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, probably most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the centre, I'd go for it.
Plenty of apartments there are newly renovated or newly built now.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
Most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath on Sunday, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but he does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annika, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
But we were still talking, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying presents all the time, and I'll definitely buy something for Dada and Lucie, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and can't afford it, so are firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is only capable of defending Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the countryside should not just be a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has become scarce in mountain and foothill areas, and even places where there has been no shortage of water are experiencing lower rainfall.
Climate change is the cause of the drought affecting much of central Europe.
But the way we manage our land is also adding to the impact.
What can we do to prepare for drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it's gonna be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know shit about playing hockey, and the tactics (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total dud too.
And whether you're hockey team is "bear Russia" or "lame China" losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than being tied.
But anyway, listening to Czech commentators nitpicking what referees don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's the way it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it's like any other time, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than they've won, I guess it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, 74 others.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily count since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK's Health and Safety Executive, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospital admissions occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour boss Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz by saying that it was conducted "virtually", via computer.
However, it was attended by groups of Downing Street staff gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV's commercial television in Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him as Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can it be expected to be?
It will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because the last two elections under Orbán were not either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies in order to profit from this, and does other tricks of a greater or lesser degree.
The latest one so far is that, in practice, everyone can vote where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition might succeed.
So just to reiterate, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether they would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and seats will be won by a united opposition.
This is a great unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not play even harder in their bid to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new developments.
It all starts with the language.
I've been beaten up quite a lot, last time I was 14, my mum's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has for a long time but then bangs her extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time I'm very choleric and used to rage terribly as a kid, to the point where I'd lie on the floor in convulsions and be all blue, I was probably taken to the shower twice to calm myself down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, when I was a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I'll at least punch something to get it out, and when I was younger I'd slap my parents on the arm like that (so I wouldn't get hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it too.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting kids is just plain wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that point when it was no longer "parenting," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, I guess it's impossible not to screw up your kids at least a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not worried about loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you having the money to pay the mortgage?
Kocner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia's trial of journalist Kuciak's killers go?
The main trial in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová has begun in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It has stirred civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How significant a turning point will the trial be for Slovakia?
The press are hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition got orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition from the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and the company bounced back.

Another government ends and the law on municipal involvement in the selection of storage sites is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste is still not in place.
The government's Legislative Council has suspended consideration of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities concerned, which are associated in the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments are expecting from the law a significant strengthening of their options in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the repository site is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will proceed at all at a given site.
This can be ensured by obliging the Repository Authority to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposal for a substantive plan almost completely disregards public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set-up of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
Under today's legal standards, municipal representatives realistically have few options to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a repository site.
They can only comment or appeal in certain permitting procedures, but the authority or minister whose interests are at stake decides.
Any appeal has no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-determination of local authorities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly applied in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as Sweden and Finland.
Moreover, the drafting of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and which follows on from the contract with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for this work is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage said: After the industry ministers, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We offer a helping hand in this regard.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of the lack of municipal rights in such a crucial construction project in a similar way to the municipalities directly affected in the selected locations.
The Platform Against Deep-Sea Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to advocate for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that is not limited to deep-sea repositories.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was finally scared off by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new figure at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I used to put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in a 2018 interview.
This time, I wanted to take it slow.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects a gaming reader, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, for example, and maybe a college text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that don't need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life where there are bosses but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's probably not possible to translate a boss in one word, English and other languages don't solve it (interestingly, only Catalan translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply an important for the story or the game in general, computer-controlled adversary stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or a task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
The Czech police have also joined the search.
The police have been searching for the 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since 7 December.
The British police are also assisting the British police through Interpol.
The Czech woman Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular about her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are cooperating closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
It said she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She is believed to be from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The local MP Harriet Harman has joined the search for Petra.
She has been involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face on them.
"We are very worried about her," she told a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorising the Czech Republic in the run-up to Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight drop in attack campaigns, attacks picked up significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We saw a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeting the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's malicious attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was labeled as Copy of corrected invoice for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in late August and early September, and with the holidays and the end of the year approaching, attacker activity is on the rise again.
The Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists intercepted campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still behind nearly a fifth of all detections.
Attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt also continued to appear.
An attachment in Czech may be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and suppression of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demos of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media is reporting.
From the footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That is to say, a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led them to find common ground.
Anti-vaxxers, anti-Russians and others alone could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are on the rise in popularity, reminding me of the Million Moments for Democracy turned inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be birthed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the money coming in, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-plus-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left or center movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we are going to have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action by scientists of which humanity is justly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister who is advocating change
Bulgaria's President Rumen Radev has tasked Kirill Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties, which claim to fight graft and abuse of power, failed to reach an agreement, leading to two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived have been calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech left work at around 7:45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by a co-worker on December 3.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court ruled that the paintings of the Mole in the rooms in Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a manhole cover had been gaping for a month.
A life was at stake.
The municipality referred complaints to the Regional Directorate of Transport, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to gap.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "address the situation intensively".
