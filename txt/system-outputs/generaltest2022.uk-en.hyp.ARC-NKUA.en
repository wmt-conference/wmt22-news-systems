In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the Agency the participants of the event, the Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This area is now, like the building, controlled by armed Russian troops using weapons against protesters and kidnapping people.

Zelensky: Mariupol - the heart of the war, will cease to fight - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) - people who pulled away a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we ascertain.
We believe in our result, in our victory.... "
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Quote: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I do not think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there is nothing, there are no people. "

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine reported this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha, "the statement reads.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be brought to justice.
You can view the list by the link.

In the liberated cities and villages recorded mass killings of Russian military civilians.
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But I was not surprised at all. What is happening is what I was waiting for with sadness...
I took the children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and I remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was allowed to remove a copy from the execution case of his great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-yard" nobility, never in serfs did not go.
The fact that they lived in hamlets and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the pahara and the feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the surname of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
Apple from the apple tree near, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio, doomed to the execution of peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia excellent (without sarcasm) information resources like "Immortal Barrack," qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that on the computer found files with child pornography, for her put in prison, and there quickly died.
KGBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why do you suddenly wonder at their actions now?
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year-old Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were imposed.
And then over what happened, made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.
So you saw my photos in the swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough?
Sorry because I have no one to ask
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the children went, because Galya can not know them

Everyone is following the Facebook page.
Asked to send you greetings and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about the people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.

So in Nestor so far only frostbite and in Galinka the temperature is 37.7 dinners 38
General Chapek's turn is very slow there.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I do not know how in Europe, but in our country people marry for various reasons, mostly selfish, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I do not love a person, nothing will work.
Yes, we took home and took my aunt away at once.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there would still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it is not necessary. Only if it will. I am also very grateful to you.
I really felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had a lot of questions to ask God why there are situations in my life that just made me despair of everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a meeting
This is so, but we are not yet oriented in the area and do not know where everything is. Today, the supermarket was looking for an hour and returned on foot. Two blankets are not suitable, so two and need a large size
Even now, I thought of you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only know how to communicate in Russian or someone else from the family?

In the vodafone application, I can neither change the tariff so that I have normal calls and the Internet does not replenish the number.

According to "European Pravda," writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the version of the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to be matched relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps formed will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?

Tell me how to get to the city center?

For me, marriage is the sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman themselves solve issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are around.
Why not try this way yet

Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that it was without errors.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also hope for it very much

Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where I felt my heart reciprocity.

That she was not afraid that no one came
I did not go. Yes, I baked myself. This I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you leave the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history. "
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, the Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must continue. "
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of cities blocked by it and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange a tour, and write when to be collected
Everyone was sick only Lydia did not get sick in them was omicron a new kind of covid

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides during the war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries - for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Damn Questions," together with the editor of "European Truth," we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in the negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here

I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do very decently and I left him.
After a while he came back again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.

Russian Army Threatens to Launch Missile Strikes on Kyiv: They Say "They Haven't Done This Before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army had previously refrained. "
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorohozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the occupiers destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kyiv, and in addition, on the outskirts of the capital there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a number of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod said that near the city allegedly fell "Ukrainian shell."
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is strongly against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.

Mozog refuses to accept...

You can't take a lot of things.
You did not take anything out of the house... you go 1000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what's next? Unknown. How much so? Not known. Children ask for sweets. And you can not. It's expensive for you.

These are heroic guides who, without fear, go to the war zone, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into wagons.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that under fire take out garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first-aid kits to the front.

Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is this?
The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" on weapons handed over to us by the allies.
Direct speech of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to" knock down "the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 SAMs transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the world.
Sorry, I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost per month and whether it will work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and resentment after evidence emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed the reports as a "provocation".
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must respond to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "a violation of international law."
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who" ordered "this story," - said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another statement of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Russian Investigative Committee issued a statement announcing an "investigation" into Ukraine's "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," Zelensky said in a video message, moving from the Ukrainian language to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head, "he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw on the street up to 10 bodies.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near the site, which locals say was used by Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kyiv, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupiers viciously took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list, there is another item, which is currently much less information - the removal of the local population to the enemy territory.
Since about the middle of March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrayinska Pravda" has found exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Yosyp Zachepynsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true Plast members, Denys and Maryna collected alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own cars, and suburban buses did not take anyone anymore.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke both non-Russian and non-Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They asked: "Who is there?" - I said yes. - "Come out!."
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, whether there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys 25-35 years old.
They said: "Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bilyi (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO" Viking, "who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was good that they came because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looting.
Chickens brought himself, one tied to one leg St. George ribbon, and the other - his white Scotch tape and called it "Opolchenka".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to reveal their own or someone else's.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, and behind them - the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - our constantly got into it from the "Bayraktars".
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been moving since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor."
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say that we do not want either there or there.
To which they answered: "Pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and began to shoot from under the house - or "Grad", or mortars.
And then came back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit in the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland - they say, "you will be shot there, the organs will be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were fires, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that Russian equipment was immediately taken to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear the shots! The rocket shoots, and a trace is visible - it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around on the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonky" near Gomel.
His head, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: "Here, I am a hohol, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until they reach your goal.
Poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, it will be so. "
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were called so) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian Consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station said that without passports no one in the bus will not take.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr, said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from landfills.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe.
They say, "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland were waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we pass the registration, decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, perhaps, as many as Estonian ones. "
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, could not - the house is no longer there.
Nobody really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center can not?
Thank you, we have it all. And we are always waiting for you!
Thanks for the arrangement, the hoes are good
And in this small apartment does not catch vayfay, basically all your questions I answer and now I do not know how to be? And children from Monday classes online, and there is no Internet.

Can I agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk reported the joyful news - on March 31, the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some tied their hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the dead - minors.
Olha Sukhenko, the elder of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband Ihor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
On both sides of the road 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth."
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
Because when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100% support, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes, "Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no such war, or it would look different.
"It would unfold differently, we would have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war, "he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war ended and return to home

"I tell her that the" repair of the TV and radio "was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances were warned so as not to let go of excess when they call."
"For a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law the info about the war.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in the Stain (cat - UP) on the belly and hind legs skinned fur - it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The stain, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions. "
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polyova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in the apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and the fact that I was near - formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours. "
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hears badly - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I was hiding in my room.
First of all, she hid her receiver and TV.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. These are 6-7 people.
Asked to talk to her about anything, not about the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments:)
Good evening, I somehow did not think about it:)

I tell you the embassy is only here,
The Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, participating in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Eidin Eislin, a Briton who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke with him
We received news from him: "It took 48 days, we tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon. "
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Journalists of the air force contacted the mother of the soldier Ann wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son said that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brenan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about the plans of their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrov" units.
Also in social networks, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed, in which Eislin allegedly speaks with his friend an American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried in civilian clothes to get out of the city, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere."
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere was... the place for which the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making of the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - this is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The one that was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be part of them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law takes off under patriotic slogans, then others may take off tomorrow - for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this provision was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denys Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to it!
MP, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All the fullness of power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because the draft law 7176 does not introduce any changes in the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the first word" war "leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
First, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine," to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In the Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, they will introduce an enhanced curfew for 2 days.
Pavliuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5. "
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean up and mine the territory.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6: 00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After Russia's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyj Swaboda," human rights center "Vyasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the strong support of the "SOBR" special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Viasna", during the arrest, the men were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of "BZHD" and the administrator of thematic resources of "BZHD" in "VKontaktie and" Odnoklassniki "Valentyn Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports @ belzhd _ live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at the railway transport and infrastructure facilities of Belarus within the framework of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian "rack partisans" thus try to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a statement on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision of more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector output includes manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms, "the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
This would prohibit U.S. citizens from carrying out transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blockade of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

Good afternoon, Mr. Reirard! Sorry I didn't see. I'll do it now and I'll send it to you right away.
We will now go to the medical commission

Tomorrow I listen, the Internet does not work well. Good night
You are happy what you will do
Thank you.. found something from things, but there was nothing from the technique...
Both beginners, except the alphabet do not know anything
Nothing happens.

Children can be taken with you, there are enough toys here:)
I guessed about dad
Probably, I am very naive or very in love, but I will come up with something with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how it will be paid, please, no credits.
Write me straight and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Do you need to take with you the outfit that they gave?
Today is not my day. broken blinds in the living room. morning one. now in the evening another
Something came from you, I do not see that
I am also very sad
Let me remind you about the invoice later
Do you have only a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do a house cleaning and how much does the house have windows?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for the son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dyspenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons connections
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1 + 1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which she received from the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to take part in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As the leader of "Azov" Andrey Beletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by the soldiers of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same, while we stay here
2 hours drive)) walking, mom shopping and back)!
It is not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here.
The squadron of Czech drones has started flights over Ukraine since today.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https: / / www.facebook.com / examplehere101 / Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of copters - the place of their deployment will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I did not worry, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't have time. A lot of luggage.
soon I return to Ukraine, continue to work
Okay. If it's okay, I'll agree
I will try myself, but if there are problems I will write to you, if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in Mrs. Starosta in a village in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Perhaps she will be happy and her mood will rise
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze on the street.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have to overcome 😊
mom and dad need to obey
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's carriage.
Today it was cooler and rain. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But it is not a pity for destroyed houses, it is a pity for people who are being bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore the flag of the European Union, destroyed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They demolished the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom, so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given
In Czech there is someone to talk about, if anything.
Because I live like in a hostelDo twelve people will be here, and then go to work
Hello, a little better.
Today I was in the manger.
Even today I slept there.
Therefore, we already have great progress.
I will definitely bring dumplings another time!
today I have no power to do them
Since I am pushing away from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say in late April or early May.
Just asked if you have something to say about it..
hello, sorry, I did not write off cooking dinner for a long time and slept a little
if you don't mind yet, could I come today?)
or we will meet after your arrival)
He is modest with us, he has been learning a lot lately. I realized that he needs it very much in his life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the Director of the Department of Economics of the region Vysočina.
She was very happy with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the manger.
On Monday, I have to bring proof of employment as well as cash payment for the nursery.
I'm lazy from Friday
I do nothing only a lot of them and I sleep (and I drink a lot of water)
if tomorrow I go to the doctor and I went with you, if you can
I have to deliver another analysis
and so do not have to go again
The drain tank works very poorly, it washes away badly. You need a master. You need to adjust.
So there's just enough
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have signed up for.
And children are fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can go there is one question
If you still need help write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we did not really want you to raise funds so that people do not believe that we are speculating on this!
But for online filling I did not have two points:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
😄😍What a great idea. Now I'll watch the video. It will be good, because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.

so can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
Collected several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day that I was not at work there is a pass
Summary of staff: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Trans-Dniester region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Quote: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Trans-Dniester region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobozhansk direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzia, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, the recruitment of servicemen from the said brigade is carried out.
The enemy feels a special problem when recruiting positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of warfare, will continue attacks on transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, some units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10."
By forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Zolote, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
The enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to catch, but I doubt
And how can you sleep you want and I hold you
Do you really mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see me today, tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and even more so 1 + 1. We do not need to configure:)
I will turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
I am running out of package tariff for the month:)
Can we do that on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, embroidery thread
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, be sure to 🙏🏻
I read the announcement on Facebook, then apparently Google wrote something in its own way., I think the phone number is enough
Hello, we are the things that you brought, but there are things that are small for us you can bring them in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then next week I can start to go to work because tomorrow I plan to go to the Labor Office to submit documents (if it happens, because there are very large queues) and on Saturday it rains:)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working for Teva
Friends are old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilt and shame because of the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is subjected on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, succinctly answered Sasha. - Now after the search we go through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Medusa, Navalny's organization and a number of other places - did many of you do at least something to resist this regime?
Except that participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which are now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you to some extent owned freedom and democracy - messy even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year for 1917.
Why, whenever you finally have a revolution, do you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer near him. Why is it so?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did from the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, refresh, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option - and humbly resigned to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to equalize Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I then worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and with my own eyes saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens. "
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to make good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but isn't it a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shone from the chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuriy Shchekochykhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the case did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or fell silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much if we did anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a bit of sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when there was such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went to the protests.
The name of Navalny became callous, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European aspirations, they once captured the Maidan - and never left it.
They built a tent camp on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit to it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shayka suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding new things in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which was started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbegs, public vaifay and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and it becomes only better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I allegedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw on the streets of Homs state snipers cold-blooded shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I was silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I was silent because I am not a member of the trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I was silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say something in my defense. "
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did that.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really speak now - as, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
The majority allows themselves to speak from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new gulag or make a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin will deal with the Ukrainians - or that it seems very likely that if he does not succeed - he will take up you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly alone went to the protests and still held a short time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, were not in such a distant past - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority is on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues at all.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what everything is going on.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights still remain.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or you'll be crushed.
I doubt that you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which in the end will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not break out of you: because of the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to light up in the province, in small cities.
When prices soar and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies in itself, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was defeated, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300 thousand, it will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them into Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a clear fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I would be in your place too afraid.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really tries to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a chat computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a raw cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and will only continue to intensify, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home

I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes and Mr. Valeriy yesterday opened our children's room until 19:00.
