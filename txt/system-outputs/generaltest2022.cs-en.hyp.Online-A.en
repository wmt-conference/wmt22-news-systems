The great return of the Czech underdog is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Pilsen and Chelyabinsk in Russia was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he alternated and since then he has not appeared on the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower body injury," the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He made 94.5% of his saves in the AHL.
The Pilsen hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL ,Francík played 36 games, his success rate of saves is 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's mask on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt, as are Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot race in June.
Charles, who wears a cylinder on his head and a face mask, helps Camille put on her face mask in color matching her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns from Slavia in Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz reported that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice Club, said that the Red and White did not commit any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly involved in its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminologists reportedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 sk slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should be promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file does not indicate whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opponent's alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was unleashed last year in mid-October by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football positions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The guns will be of a new, but basically worse type (artillerymen must leave the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, we have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria climbed from the river and did damage to crops, so I was seated there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down calmly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went in a moment.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, he was gone.
That is, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a confluence of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermovision, which almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, dear things put to your feet in the spacak and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts for the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of čsla, which were experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that the trained could take, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can be led and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will no longer be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
mainly we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had him.
Then there is such a situation that you watch like a dude who did not hit an empty gate 2 minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and says to yourself "tvl and what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "watering down a defender" is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to outplay one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: a variant of omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
That being said, Merck's molnupiravir is the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up on tape first also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking "how our beak grew".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their jobs and lynching the media.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in the Czech Republic and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to learn again where what is, so all objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of security or speed of deployment of warheads due to a more western location.
In those underground shelters (in each maple there are two) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
At the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was often too expressive, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he walked regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkeys, but he was fine, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same grade, a different class.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called a month later that he had already rewritten it on himself.
I say for myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (they work, they work, they don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But as soon as someone comes, stretches out his hand, occupies apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble. so it doesn't matter what color it is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for as yet undetermined reasons drove into the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice, Fajtlová said.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post office is often free," says the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he now has to add VAT and hand over customs data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail informing him that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, there is also a problem that people do not respond to calls to deliver the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about half here, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
This year they added 2% in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are only sent to prison for 6 months?
This just doesn't bother me how a court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future reports of rape victims?
A man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers found that the woman was on a wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer Slavs ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should man then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god than Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of thousands of gods and the one real god I didn't hit send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All the components of the Army of the Czech Republic would like something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being rehashed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never again invade here.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Well please the lord.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what would not be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's these days, but a stubborn teenager behind the knob of a remote-controlled device can cope.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the project map KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased in price by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugstores and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, high-volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all the garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such sites.
"Gradually, there are more collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I rather find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to use the technique from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Ahead of the weekend, Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be completed in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and the left agree on little, but Europe does.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has had quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a us versus them story and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being nachcípanej" A few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With influenza, I do not have diarrhea.
(Personal experience only. I don't think everybody has it that way)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on December 20, will contain a traditional literary supplement.
And along with it will come cultural tips.
We are attaching the books to you, the subscribers, in addition to this digital edition, so that you may have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.
Prose texts that follow on from the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unusual poetic mindfulness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of small town and Czech society.
A story about a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a desired illusion.
The Bohemist and comparative artist transports the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its presentation surpasses folk versions in brutality and escalates into a horror film about emotional emptiness.
And about the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we have become accustomed to listening to.
Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about each other to make for a life together.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or even slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services under the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in Northern Moravia or West Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Daily, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned closure work, the carrier also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
Carriers will also be exchanged on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they died.
I have never heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't seen anyone deliberately conceal the facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
Rather, my point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in anyone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and a lot of things they also resented.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our point of view does not exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT where they turned out someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them in this many times.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young it is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT and it leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even on quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more he is heard.
In conclusion, I also did not see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was a two-way :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be generally unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If there's one thing that connects me with people, it's interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has sermons more about theology than about politics, but then he always gets some cocoon about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services with the Hussites because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. St. Michael's on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Scouts did not go to Vienna for him, and in the morning they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year as well.
The Light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the club, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing changes in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrl.
The subsequent distribution of the light on Saturday, December 18, will be taken care of by Scout couriers, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic even where the dormitories do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep their distance, there were as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the bethlehem light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its dissemination for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website of www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make good use of this money, but I do not understand why this money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-financed by project xy" notices in the hallways and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is a delay in development where this company is both holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads do not move me, but then I catch myself that they also influenced me - it's just so worked out that you can't always resist it.
That is one of the reasons why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling of this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim to be krytic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record more than two hundred of them.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being created.
Four times as many Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are mainly associated with this period, such as the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom in Christmas films didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter that much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive frenzy and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years," Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, but it is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be involved in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he should have attacked for a better finish from 20th place, which he drove in qualifying.
However, Haas' Russian Nikita Mazepin will not make it to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher taking the track from the last place, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms, according to Haas.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all partie formula1.com s involved," she said.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can he.
A potential substitute would have to qualify or ride in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not struggling with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just ending season, and last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for that, too.
And everyone will be stolen that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in our home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there is another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Mutation Omikron spreads in South Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor was there contact with anyone residing abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill on his return.
California will restrict arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that kept the Texas abortion ban in place, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established abortion rights across the U.S. until about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge him in the usual court order.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed the maintaining of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He said he instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sell assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits for making them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would confirm.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also the vaccines themselves are improved, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that.
Another fact is that in a short time a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should come on the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and internet providers.
Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used the new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's €36 billion plan to draw on the EU's recovery fund to rebuild economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally withholding us from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw faces "political dictates carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to know it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an avoidance, I will not even smell in any market, the event does not happen, the golden shop on the square, there may not be such a choice, but mostly they have everything I need and it has some order, so I am done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most of the anti-vaccine opponents are just a little more out of the picture than most vaccine proponents.

Binary reasoning: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.

Wow, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon as a child.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "catch" she just brought the spoon and laid it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few blows to the butt (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and degree) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in a way whether he doesn't obey and gets it, or he gets better and the punishment won't be.
In the end, all I had to do was start listening to the warning.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether the sacred document to which he swears and which he has been learning at school since childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes they are better spared.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exert their power.
Covid does not choose, in the University Hospital Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
However, there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires staying in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in severe condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
"At present, a child of several months and adolescent age is lying with us," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination also alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the application of the vaccine dose to children," the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on the mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He is fed up with the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra and the Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is better facing the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, hey, don't you want an elephant?
I've got it and it's great.
The wife is glad because she grazes the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want for 5000, - you elephant sell.
Friend: so yeah, I'll slap myself, it's going to be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is broken, there is a giant shit everywhere, the car is dismounted, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says: you're talking badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works for its integration.
It is still operating at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.
It also occurred to me, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm vocabulary.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment on 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for 'Spanish fruit and mandarin' it is no longer clear that mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further for American forces.
But again, if only I'm just a little :D
Be that as it may, it is a nonsensical demand
An earthquake of five magnitude was recorded in Tokyo.
The Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and surrounding areas were hit by a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on Sunday.

There was also no tsunami warning, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
The horrifying footage shows the moment when a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehab experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehab with monkey world in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a twelve-week prison sentence with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned for life from keeping animals and has to pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on a woman's phone following a raid on her apartment over drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (less than 50,000 crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?

So what the fuck is this learning?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly taught for the lot of people who will need that thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I meant absolutely seriously... ... because you just don't need to.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably due to our communist past and incitement against educated people and elites) However, the cost of having barbarians standing at our machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, covid here probably never reached these proportions.
Wedding at a Glance: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to curious questions from curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to cut off all contact and even block him on social media.
It was creaking between Kadri and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was upset in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling, and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity as his now ex-wife didn't like his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, it just won't give me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe for what.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In one security camera, he is captured walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, while drunk he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

Isn't that enough for you as a reason?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
People voted for the new councils on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the councils elected here have disintegrated.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-Chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and staffing.
In Komne in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member assembly.
The STAN list received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the assembly, with 18.52 percent of voters casting their vote.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, also got into the council for them again.
One seat in the assembly was won by the Komňané – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the List of the Municipality for the People, which was voted for by 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates of Naděje pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the 2018 regular elections, won one more seat and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing the fool to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve yards.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was hit by rescuers of the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and fell head on concrete!
In Vítkovice caught coal.
But not in the way it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the EMS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus about inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the infection is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Penova managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate at light weight, he showed great throttling against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored the victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt away with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pene.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", nunes did not lose for seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Penova got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and knock the attack away.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier fared better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn't do very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the throttling away.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a masterful triumph, putting a hard right back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he recharged him with a series of precisely aimed strokes and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she has lost.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether it is a masculine, feminine or middle gender.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the genus is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declensed, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an uninflected form.
For example, the words "trouble" or "hip" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the first they are declensed according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the pattern "song".
For another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/line", "kohlrabi/kohlrabi" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally inflected, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle gender uninflected, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There are tensions at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to march to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we were suffocating, says a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires, which Australia has been battling for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the inhabitants themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic repercussions, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how these people are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have money to complete
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a precarious situation.
It does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already under construction family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're doing well and we're going to get even better.
But real visions are missing, says the commentator of the Czech Radio Association – mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO Chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What essential things have we learned?
Like in this, my diploma seems great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
State exams are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something remains in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the state exams and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got it right and I had it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
But don't overload your emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as them.
The people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it in such a way that he would put Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a spanner in the works for artists.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, they constantly change what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been fucking me up a lot lately, so I might have to stoop to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry have had success and can't let it happen.
In the end, I might even like to see something user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party in Donbas
The Union – yes, broken – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On the eighth of December 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Białowieża Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one session in the Białowieża Forest what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put the brakes on agriculture, broke away from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of force".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with the idea of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which this meat by changing its price becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - nothing.
This about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like a good matrosh, full of completely useless precepts, like I should wash and not be a dick.
Too bad for paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how much of a f*ing situation they are.
She threatened me several times to hurt herself because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year it was a great relationship but then another half a year passed and she started to squint on a stick.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I told her I was breaking up and lied to her but I could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get caught up in some kind of amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Prefer to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbed by buying a cloud of tests and rushing for positives, who would not even know about this terrible disease if it were not for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator have been placed under house arrest for five days.
In the West, they have stopped the antics and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing buzzing.
I see that the good old scumbag is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises to train products and business skills quickly turned into "you may not be interested, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more on how to scare and talk a person out.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to swipe a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, you learned not to jump on every bacon right away and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
There are people successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In the corporation where I work, I have not experienced many such things.
HR is at peace, managers are mindful of their management and do not stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form that it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will look at what came out and what did not) - it is more of a self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're kind of a near-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched to no avail for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from the Uherské Hradiště region had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not share more information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on Her way home from work on November 28, and she was supposed to collect money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by her work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, interpol listed her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police detained a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of, but did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new councils were given at the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the councils elected here have disintegrated.
99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for new municipal elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
To come to terms with how idiotically a large part of the population at all its strata is what I have a problem with until now.
I'm most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will make me finally less dependent on other people not being.
He would be stripped of his presidency and the capacity to regain it.
However, the chance that this will actually happen is very small, as others here mention.
Moreover, I am not sure that the discarding of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who renounce sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they haven't had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks and video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report having not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them saying they have been sexless in the past year in 2021.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious disposition also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided by the opinion of premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts that trend," Stone says of the thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, most importantly, social drinking during the pandemic, are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without a job or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order for a COVID vaccine is about whether society should force part of the population to behave in ways that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's quite a difficult question, which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we do not order them to do so and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an octogenarian who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination who, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, is shouting something about bullying and the totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizerská fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about the gentleman.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and who we probably don't see in the middle - the followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but he and a friend started talking.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, artificially triggered the migrant crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When police told her she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun crashed into the vehicle and asked for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after discovering that she had more than two per mille in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog darlings.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the Dog That Taught People to Live, another film Here We Watch is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and the director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some well-known characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, so they start inviting dog owners, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's sum up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he just determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken away from the hospital,  so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog could take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a doggie competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the pension will of course get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits naked and make-up with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and chatter as a cured vegetarian, one cannot help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters' characters and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression is down-to-date.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parts, they do not have much to play.
The only merit of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog buzzwords, let alone the more vernacular profanity that the characters commit.
The argument is not even the long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a bit too much erotica and a minimum of a sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It is a job like any other, in which case a brigade for extra earnings.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for israel's Water Management Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
On the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, tankers are increasing.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
Clashes broke out in Isfahan, Iran, between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I the lady a little and grilled her during a conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I spent a moment with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
Downhill skiers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts.
While lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set out on cross-country trails and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," jakub Hanuš, the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people went to jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare praise the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the Czech News Agency.
"We have only seen incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rentals and shops.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
A greater strain is expected in the period of ski courses.
David Šinták, Managing Director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, great demand is recorded by the rental in the Novako area in Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who have no property go abroad.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election at all.
If life here is stupid, then some traditional V4 madman can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behavior and we're starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnec worked, said in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last reportedly spotted on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care group said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help her find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Mp Harriet Harman, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably scared to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family, and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine in this way either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in '38 is off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.
Suburban train transport will be served by S7 trains, which pass through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will newly stop the express train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines extending into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and operations will be adjusted to 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka was also established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when express line number 404 will newly depart.
Lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of ten Central Bohemian local lines has been cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes are also awaiting passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko, is being extended.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do a classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy at most pizza buns and a snack yogurt and apple.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the sapling can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from riding off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of Gifts about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing more than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been dragging it together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she has kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer to her ears.
But apparently he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it jumps out of the can on them, or those whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or you insist that everyone really knows the list of your former partners in detail and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's žúžo, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare their new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there for a long time as vice-president of the Football Club Juventus.
They went out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been separated on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are also just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything essential, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly does not hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., this is quite a bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides, it is close to most but faculties (I do not know where exactly you are going).
So I have never been looking for a rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own pocket, or let them go according to the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he throws a few crowns into a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier had made such comments about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone going to have an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
I would consult you directly with the person who assigned you the work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it from the eye, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and into the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer has simply created his own emblem that fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Oder Kingdom than an Odryan Empire?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our Presidency will be.
This is a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with the English, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's totally fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but all they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, so confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we were always talking, so christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm going to be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy Dáda and Lucie something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And are we Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and far between, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, and smaller rainfall is recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture so far.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it will be so, I can barely keep myself in skates on the ice, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also overall hallucinations.
And whether you are a hockey team "copper Russia" or "lama China" so lose by two goals even if you do not have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what the referees do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic 1967 are at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK's Health Safety Authority, said on Television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister defended that the quiz was taken "virtually", via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, there is growing pressure to remove Johnson from the premiership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election by an overwhelming majority.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can they be expected to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They are unlikely to be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of parliament and one of Fidesz's leaders, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, telling intelligence chiefs that the opposition was a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has her for a long time, but then she bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a child terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and it was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me a slap in the face, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, as a child I was quite fighting, now I hit at least something to discharge and as younger I slapped my parents on the hand for example (so as not to get too much over the hold), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my explosiveness, but certainly the upbringing has a part to play in it.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just something, it's probably not possible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why op should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call pussies those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial begins with the four accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his links to the top slovak politicians and the judiciary.
How crucial will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and the company bounced it off.
There were deaths on Czech television with covid half a year ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of repositories nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a fundamental overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their possibilities in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is reproached by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a factual plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for storage, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not really have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for a repository.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but it is the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit to decide.
Any action shall not have suspensive effect on the execution of the exploration or construction work.
The codecision of local authorities requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with havel & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following the contracts with attorney-at-law Jan Zemánek.
According to the Register of Contracts, the total amount for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman of the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities in search of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in a similar way as the municipalities directly affected in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to a deep geological repository.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman ( 69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than a standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is probably not possible to translate the boss in a one-word way, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is simply significant for the story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since December 7.
Through Interpol, he is also helping the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of it.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in posting leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a news conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it's not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the year drew to a close.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively scans for stored credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but continues to be behind nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's demo of clever people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of estimating around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That is, there are a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I would argue that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the constant discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found common ground.
Only anti-vandals, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association have a rising popularity, it reminds me of A Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this discontent depends not only on the money inflow, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists of which humanity is rightly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
Of the "secretly" captured footage, it is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, information about the children's hospital worker is also being called by her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behavior and we're starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnec worked, said in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last reportedly spotted on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care group said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help her find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) was reported by an anonymous person that his paintings violated copyright.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of the Little Mole in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the RMD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole was still there.
Eventually, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RMD began to "intensively deal with the situation".
