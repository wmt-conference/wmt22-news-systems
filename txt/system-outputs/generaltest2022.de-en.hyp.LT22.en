The goods have cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods...
I'm #PRS_ORG# and so it's not a problem for me.
Do you only need a number or instruction about what to teach the package to be tracked by you?
I ordered #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I think this is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it for the better price or do I have another option?
I also find, in principle, that children should not be allowed to play a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it's great siblings also good to take care of the little ones.
Take a look at the bottles.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough child, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy for a short time and it is OK for him, this is good.
You can best determine if it suits your children.
It is not that he wants to develop K2 and accompany it for hours when sleeping.
In legal terms, it is likely to be questionable.
So perhaps the statement of psychology comes as well.
After all, if something should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;).
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember a few years ago to have read a Krimi / Thriller and I can still remember almost the whole plot, but I don't want to miss the title partout here maybe someone knows here.
The story was of fear and torment.
In the beginning of history, an animal nurse commits suicide by exaggerating himself with food and going to his cats.
The case is taken by a commissary who, after a brief investigation to his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece who has a fear (before fire) and lands on this therapist.
There is more self-morning and there is another protagonist - a photographer charged anonymously before any suicide will go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately the patients face the most extreme way.
(a woman jumpt out of the window another rides with intentions to death).
This fear is described in the book as "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the rough plot I'm quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh, I have the password for Wlan not available.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps must I take after this?
Is it possible to get the price difference?

For Omicron: Johnson Wants to Prevent Refreshing
Always new Omicron cases care for politics and science in the UK.
For this reason, until New Year, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance faster than ever before in the coronavirus vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a Booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in parts of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why immunization must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that protection levels can be increased with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let you now grow! ", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were registered in the UK, increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65%.
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am arguing for all of them.
I sent out an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I have lied him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can I help someone?
** I am a foreigner and I also want to keep no official over the feet.
Conclusion: everyone should think of pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only one I bought today does not go.
Apparently the chair had an invisible lack of sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days not anymore.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me.
[CW] The feeling if I can not help.
Content warning: I'll write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really likes to me and unfortunately too often is that many victims do not help or think we could not help them.
I understand that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do with such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation among four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can not reach all.
I do not know what the reason, perhaps it is fear of fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, in part itself is very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can not.
It will never be easier.
Please, remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so inconspicuously important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking recording: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, is recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-debacle of the MHP Giant of Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least, on Youngster John Patrick, it was forsaking.
Nothing: For the second time in not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg’s coach John Patrick had said: "We still have some rage in the gut.
However, the game wasn't put on the table, but it increased again, given the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball League.
Still more than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
Representing this is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The Three Quote amounted to just 13%, 4 hits (all from the young John Patrick) to say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained.
Take the ball.
Others have responded to his opponent Sebastian Glim: "A horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It feels like 10 000 people".
Only 750 visitors were allowed to attend the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, but those came at their expense.
Last but not least, BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Glei still praised.
While in Patrick’s team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) prevented the Giants from a total debacle and came up to eight points after having already retired 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also came to twelve points.
Fortunately, there is a lot of time for Hadern.
The giants already receive a maximum of 750 spectators in the Frankfurt skyline on Wednesday (19:00).
we had another mail address earlier, but I changed that.
Yes, I have already reported some months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed and have written them again.
Originally we had already reported about half a year ago.
Always as sniffed from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59.
He likes to delight his audience with new interpretations of drums from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently he is on the way with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to happen.
Max Raabe would like to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won’t happen.
The planned concert was relocated in May 2022 - "to the authorities" to contain the corona virus.
Other performances planned during the Advent season also have to take place on the website of the singer who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, artists will want to catch up with their appointments already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a adolescent.
In Berlin he studied opera singing and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with the composers.
Since then the Bariton has established itself with its repertoire of drums and chansons in the style of the Commedian Harmonists.
He has often been awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women this is not a problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it from the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair is hard-cooked and labelled, Max Raabe is no longer to think of the current German music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear happiness" he has been on tour since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?
It can be added with existing furniture and so we could check if it fits colour.
It still does not I can only see the cover but not flip it over.
Germany’s Minister of the Interior, Clara Geywitz, does not create a new home.
The new German Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the expropriation of large housing companies, as in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain payable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not close talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further tightening in the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rental price brake by 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to do it as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk with coalition partners about further steps," said the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.

At least 100 dead by Toronto in Kentucky.
Many tornadoes have been pulled by the US in a devastating storm.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The images from there recall a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the US have caused severe devastation, and perhaps required up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a 320 kilometers long snow of desolation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
After a visit to the disaster area, Governor Andy Besear said that everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He is alone in the state of Kentucky with up to one hundred dead, the official numbers rise every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she is sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That is a pity.

If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that only can I order the blanket now and leave it to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or given a return and wondered if it was received or processed since I have not received a confirmation.
Companies pay Vaccine premiums and Change Advertising Promises
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for the vaccine.
Thus, they are on a line with the Socialists ÖGB and Economic Chambers, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to use COVID-19 vaccines.
He is changed to a company that he has operated.
This does not make his situation better than yours.

And that he did not find you good at the time: naja no matter.
He did not find his job well.

Aid at the top of the Campaign
Boron to greeting!
For a group of 4 friends I'd like to lead the Adventure Over the Greifen Pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign dedicated to the player.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations, the individual acts are thought out and now I'm writing the entry-level adventure and stumble at the first Encounter on my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a fowl with grains of grenades to a small village near the Lake Thuran.
There the further action will develop.
A few miles away from the village, the hero is said to set up a group of Goblins and lure them into a halt.
I would like to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: conviction, action, threatening to detect the danger early on, whatever happens to the players.
Group Strength: 8 common Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with arches and saber armor.
In the case of non-consisting, the Goblins lure the hero into a cave and flank the three left and right arrows, while two with spears stop the movement.
If it comes to battle, and the heroes are subject, I have two approaches to resolution.
1. The heroes are all deliberately and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village school, a half elf.
The carnage is gone, of course.
2. If defeat is unavoidable, that half elf is attacking with two of his servants and comes to help the hero in battle.
The caricature is still there, all super.
How do you consider Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter as an entry into the adventure too much?
The Goblin group will play a crucial role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll be sure many of your ideas are appreciating and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp apart again.
And yet again.
Unfortunately, it still does not.
That's why I would like to send them back.
If you then let the backlight come then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #RS_ORG#.

I am nervous about Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was broken in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 reporting on time.
While the timing and timing of the schedule was far behind the planning phase, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it seems that for legal reasons, the F1 will take precedence and must limit itself to everything else, so that Sky DE would have no choice here.
Nevertheless, since Sky UK has handed the race to the end.
Still, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Parkeyes did the difficult situation around the heavy accident well.
Then there was the F1 again regularization with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that they had to change the tyres under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that the tyres had to change the tires when there were corresponding radio responses to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL both commentators knew immediately that there is this possibility for pitfalls.
I think such elementary rules should be easily known if you comment on the F1 at a pay TV station.
It is not the first riddle, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally I do not like the style of comments written by Roos, but admit that the taste is.
But there I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
To this end, constant nightmares are made, both of which simply seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at the (also unreasonable) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment that he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over Sky, in the round-the-clock Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV, since only the German track has to get out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also these two channels make in the training less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone doesn't let me go beyond the drawbacks.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very strong and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is the worst German TV channel broadcasting the F1.
RTL makes a better job in the four races that they can still transfer to the advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that still is not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and had nothing to date.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Air pumps are excellently suited to supply an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs can be connected to multiple outputs.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump but also offer to put a accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a shell, or something like that.
The MK series has a special sound-damaged design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outflow current or similar by means of a 4/6 mm air hose.
The fan pump should be the same or higher as the water level and should be attached to the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should set a back valve between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, once water would run backwards, running the water from the pool through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture as well as other air pumps.
MK Series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Even if we specify the processing time in ebay with 3 days, the package will be packed daily and the packages will be picked up daily.
If all goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so no one is certain, just because it took a little longer.
It would be like, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course there is no corona.
Please do not evaluate the same bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively for the package service.
Of course you like to chat about these services, even if we are currently saying...they have damned it hard.
This is also very regionally different.
Be no one evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.

Amazon founder Bezo sends Astronaut daughter and presenter into the world.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip to space.
On Saturday they were transported by the missile system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under brilliant blue skies, Bezos personally received the freshly cured astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Original, the six passengers climbed up and reared the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Original, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds on the way, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard, born in 1961 as Nasa astronauts in space, after the Blue Original missile system was named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorable guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket did not share Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after a short flight.
He has worked hard on his bets and had to do everything on his own.
She was just so flown, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would prefer to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres.
The missile system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the missile during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily with gravitylessness before the reusable object crashed off large parasites.
The International Aeronautics Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers of Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international arrangement.
It was already the third manned all-in-all trip of Blue Origin: In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor, William Shatner, who was world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origins of advancing business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and regardless of the climate.

I have of course already informed me before studying about career prospects, but I also thought at the time that I wanted to study until the promotion.
At the moment I am in doubt, especially depressing my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear super career opportunities and the profession is completely searched, on the other hand you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really care:
1) As what do you currently work?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your responses!
I'm really insecure at the moment and I think 2022 might be able to cancel my studies and make an apprenticeship to a professional computer scientist.
If you have any experience please write it :).
Extra stress on Holiday & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That’s why it’s just a post.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As seems there are also days before holidays plus bridge days.
This was the case: last week was the pilgrimage of the Virgin, which is called "Accord" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day which is semi-official.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to emails that had to go out before the race, order here order there, all *conditionally* before the long weekend.
Why?
Because "next week then" sounds so much time and that must not be?
Or because people want to do as much in a shorter week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully energized.
What is this self-governing about holidays?
What more do we have holidays if we don't really allow them to have them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all self-sufficient.
My question is simple: are we just the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no presents yet.
"The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
They will agree on the feast by baking and battling with their son.
"I love this," said Catterfeld.
But, until the timid days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I haven't got any gifts, I'll have to start now.
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of the mouse and the recreated.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 sg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the pest damage occurring in birds is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the cone consists of protein-stained substance, a particularly rich and balanced malnutrition of the bird is required for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are based on insufficient or unbalanced protein feed and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly considered and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the application of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or via the softener.

Still not Work
GDR handcraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in Silesia and Central Germany in use, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the renovation proposal of the model railroader ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and missing parts, see photos, function good, the series E 95 is a heavy freight train locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the extraction of heavy coal extracts in the Silesian grid, probably also comes from the small-series ZSCHUTSCHEK and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on the job.
The German Railway Company commissioned the AEG in 1924 to present proposals for an electric locomotive, which could carry 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains with a travel speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the supply as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with actuator drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the E 95 01-06 operational numbers.
All of them survived World War II and found themselves again on the territory of the future GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives were converted into the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The design of all six locomotives has been determined in the Dessau railway station.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked on, while the other machines served as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities were built.
Only when the E 94 was designed to ensure that the number of processing was not further increased, the E 95 focused on processing.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
As a result, protections in circuit breaked.
At the same time, the hammer and wooden wrist on this locomotive had to re-enact the protection during the journey.
Damages on the motors occurred more often and resulted in months of failures at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new building locomotives in the late 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric company at that time was not planned, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splittings, so that the E95 were put out of service.
In addition, they concluded that the German Reich's electric locomotives only wanted to occupy a single position, which would have caused a problem in the train due to the problems with the machines and the visibility of the driver's seat.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were released in the middle of 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which quits the service on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02 all locomotives have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating system on the main station hall.
It took some time for the responsibilities of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first outer design of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Museum of Transportation as an unmanned museum locomotive.
In 1986 the interior design of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the production of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time to an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five motors are capable of operation.
-The locomotives were used by 1945 on the Silesian mountain railways and the branching secondary railways, where they proved their worth on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig.
Initially, Silesia was the main area of use.
Handcraft model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical replications at the locomotive in self-employed, dusted, with play tracks, basement smell !!!, very rare handcraft model, very small edition - maybe the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHINE and BACHMANN.
The packaging can contain labels and bearing traces.
Yes, the F parts are.
I have received a bed of you.
But there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is kept from two feet. Unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately flawed.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new mails.
When will they be sent out?
no more flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right of the form, they were only too narrow.
But that doesn’t matter.
Their main purpose is to do so.
They are not flat with me.
Could I receive them?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Housing Fire With Two Squanders and High Damage
Two people were easily injured at a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
Moreover, an estimated damage to the six-digit euro area has been caused, as the police said on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were hospitalized on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not expect a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the further investigation.
But that comes much later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs.
To remove fake news - Biontech-CEO Published Vaccine Photo
On the social networking network "LinkedIn" published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021.
So far, Biontech’s chief of staff had not publicly endorsed his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccine.
The illness of a friend has led him to share it with him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, U'ur ®ahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation in the social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," he wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"After a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I will be vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
So far he has rejected that, because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply troubled when I learned that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe COVID-19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, he continued to write.
He did not ask for reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear can be difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which U’ur ’ahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle made it clear.
"I am not allowed by law to get the vaccine itself," he said.
In Germany, there is a prioritization of the vaccine.
The priority is now lifted for a long time – and the Biontech boss has dropped three times as appropriate.
Fire in Heat: Tens of People Without Power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity anymore and in many cases no heating.
A fire had lubricated a circumference station.
After a fire with heavy damage in a circumference station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg District in North Rhine-Westphalia have spent about 24 hours without electricity.
On Friday evening, the fire killed 41,000 people in several communities killed the lights.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators had been in operation until the large-scale disruption was finally fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and the helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered shelter in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The caretaker thanked the persons concerned for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We would like to thank the affected communities, the circle, the firefighters and the THW for the tireless use," said the head of the Primary Technology Division, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take several days to repair, as the Westnet assemblies could use some lines only temporary, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire following company indications.
The Flows of Power
The fire broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m., according to the data from Westnet, was severely damaged in the circulation station Neunkirchen-Seelscheid parts of the 10,000-volt circuit.
It requires extensive cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 Volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 o’clock, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppiertoth would have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seescheid have been moved to a step by step from 9:30 p.m.
Since 23:15, even the most recently affected would have electricity.
More than 80 assemblies from Westnet and partner companies have been in operation.
After building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighborhood aid.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of the elderly or the elderly and communicate to the local fire-fighting equipment houses when needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus was on setting up and operating emergency generators.
Moreover, state-of-the-art facilities were temporarily set up in schools for those who could not provide themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or need medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy and pay in Euros?
This is the daily blanket #RS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy - ”.
I can't install it on the table below.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#.
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it up and thus shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise I would have to send them back because it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate feedback.
yes this is really easier!
Then we do it!
send me the return code by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before buying, I didn't restart the E-PRS_ORG#.
Should I do so now?
I find such low credits almost ashamed.
We disagree.
Combining Northern Combined Riber Wins

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have made both s and use the version 4.5.
could be that they have heard of trouble many times.
I have bought it directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it seems to be.
Once I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

I also have to work!
To clean the application evenly and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before you apply the brush the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The First Line on the Part
Drag the brush evenly next to the stroke.
Easy overlap of the color layers creates an even surface later.
Avoid quick and easy wipes with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark may otherwise appear.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to a conclusion with a separate brush.
Otherwise, metal slitting may occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally maintained, the models reach through the decals or drawers.
From high-class aircraft, to ship names, to toll strips and car models, the Decals give the model the final glider.
Insert the Decals in the correct order as long as the parts are still well reachable.
An airplane cockpit can be easily glued to the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, pills and dentures, are the sticking time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required Decal individually and put it to you.
Decals are also referred to as water slides, because you'll moisten your back with water until the paper becomes dark through the noses.
Then move the image to a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have pre-selected before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you drag the paper sideways.
Attention: Always check if the image is correctly placed before moving it completely from the paper to prevent it from sticking, cracking or even cracking.
Excessive water with a household towel.
Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book in a short time as soon as I am looking for something else then I don't have to read the book and register and reload the book and find the place until I read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me.
Thank you very much!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Do I get back without problems?
Children's treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hi,
we were some time in child-welfare, now when it comes to reckoning with the PKV, it suddenly turns.
The string after:
We had requested the children's training in advance at the PKV and received the announcement of 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and conducted 2 (successfully) attempts, but they did not count on the PKV.
We again requested the takeover of the PKV and received 3 further tests.
After some other attempts (we have done more than promised, logically calculate the most expensive with the PKV) we filed the bills at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: with the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts miss the first promise.
The second wish for children is a new insurance case.
However, according to the GTC, "The insurance case begins with healing treatment, it ends when there is no need for treatment."
The questions to experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Would the PKV have to remind us that with a birth the remaining attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would make your opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how I best to reach them again?
In order.
We will not order anything from them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to pass on this to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment was made and now tell me that I have to send back the thing.
I don't know, I can't say that the command will be completely destroyed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I still do not receive a refund by #PRS_ORG#.
You can arrange to your manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must have a normal use.
Otherwise they may not sell him as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty period is 24 months.
No, it is not possible to buy another kind of packaging.
I will reduce the cabinet and provide it to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional hockers, but unfortunately we cannot find them.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low budget movie is, for that there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What do you think of it?
And what do you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Would like to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you.
A Consequences
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, there is no chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give up soon because it doesn't work here.
Hi
"Halber Victory" Against Belarus, with high costs for the EU.
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong the evangelical press service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU did not resolve the confrontation, declaring the researchers of the Berlin Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This virtuous state - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels itself a winner - goes on for a while.
The handling of people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not turn decisively against it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This is also weakening union cohesion.
"It does not seem to prevail when a member state puts itself in its head," as currently Poland, which not even the EU border protection agency Frontex, allows access to the border.
Moreover, the EU pays another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Rethinking the Front Line
In the meantime, according to Poland’s border protection, migrants have tried again to get to the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, said a spokesperson of the agency on Sunday.
In the incident near the place of Czermsza, the Polish officials were thrown away by the migrants with stones.
According to the data, a soldier was taken in the face and had to be provided medically by a military physician.
Altogether registered the border protection 52 tried border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border lockdowns.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU blames Alexander Lukashenko as the leader of Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania, according to press reports, closed sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
EU commissioners also traveled to countries of origin to prevent their departure.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"Therefore, the EU has thrown its market power into the quagmire and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard gangs and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also needs to consider domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not the case that the security apparatus regularly closes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes Protests after the controversial Formula One Final
In the opinion of Mercedes, Max Vertape is said to have committed two breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula One finals of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has taken the lead.
The silver arrows suggest two rounds of the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is to have overtaken regularly.
A second objection was filed against the score at the end of the race.
According to the Mercedes opinion, the protocol was not compliant on a regular basis.
At the last lap of the season, Lewis Hamilton was overtaken by the Mercedes and was in his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken cars before him.
I test it.
I speak with the bank and I am again with you.
Thank you for the support.

In order to get an optimal visual field, the magnification should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanet-acromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier virtually without any distortion and without color.
Often magnifications are marked with magnification information.
However, this information is only valid for precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the terms of use.
In order to make optimal use of your magnification, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including insulating lamps.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
When observing the optimal conditions of use - magnification close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.

#PRS_ORG# I'm going to do very nice and good service, although lasted until you came to a person, you were super.
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# Team,
I have already reported to you under the customer contact number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was said before.
You cannot deliver to England because of #RS_ORG#.
Candy sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women are looking for the Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situation when selling a tune.
Once a man should be back home even without his partner, because both could not agree.
Each year, it planted well 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situation.
That makes the pre-Christmas time always funny, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm away as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We need no discussion of the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a spinning dish.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would be something like the "danger", which by far does not seem so tasty.
Problems with Glassfibre + Deflo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiberglass connection for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Delo DLan, which had received and sent 50 Mbit/s up to a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer the full 500, but the more I continue to remove myself in the house with the module, the less coming (that is, using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc.
This means that the Internet with the new fiberglass connection is now even slower on the first floor than it was before (e.g.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses.
Could anyone explain to me why with fiberglass as much internet speed on the power line "lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely costly to store LAN cables in the house.
I'm really despairing why I created an account here.
That's why I'd be glad about an answer.
When is it time to change the account?
If you had thought that now would be quiet at the Giro accounts for the first time.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the increases in fees in the past with tricks of their customers, negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, has long been relatively generous with a 100,000 euro limit.
Now it has halved the free money and even quartered for day money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only to customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to €50,000 in Giro and Investment accounts and €25,000 for day money accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower fees apply for the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly agreed individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had been down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still true, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is currently popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the funds to two stages, initially to €50,000, and now to €25,000.
After all, more than 100 banks have, according to the Internet portal Verivox, a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at €25,000, but there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which, first and foremost, have even gotten right in front of the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should be resetting – in the event that even the upper instances, negative interest rates must be declared inadmissible, and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table has been supplied for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The lower floor is the one for 6 persons.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole Beauty Army
It now officially stands at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, which made 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, Aniston, she likes to get a chip on the day (yes, properly read: a INCLUDE chip from the bag).
The fact that you fly the hearts of the female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck - and still is looking for the great love.
And the baby wish was removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
It hurted.
The people who asked this have no idea what happened to me personally, medically, why I can not.
It was really offensive.
Stays to hope that also make success and glory happy.
Reviving Raikkonen’s End of Care
Kimi Räikkönen’s departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than intended.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn drew the gloves and washed the sweat from the forehead.
That was.
After a car crash and a slight ligament, Raikkonen had to cancel his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after less than half of the distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishes his career in the motorsport class.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children had travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen’s biggest success was the winning of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times to the podium.
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup Winner - Nolte wins in the bikini - Sport.
The brand of the Norwegian biathlon Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the aim of the bob pilot.
"I have thought that this time, I would have to enter nine and a half wins per season, then I could create it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner of the BSC Oberbärburg, who had two successes in two days at the Winterberg race.
It was only on Saturday that he rejected the attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something to the material setting and ran a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
Together with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbalenburg) and Alexander Schlüller (SV Halle) he took over the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have taken greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
Johannes Lochner, who is running for Stuttgart, took place two times earlier on rank five.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he is doing differently, then I would do so," said Holner.
Noble with Home Victory for Jamaica
On her home run, Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the double booby.
After the fourth place on the previous day in the Monobob, she ralted the World Cup victory on Sunday with the German three-time winner Deborah Levi.
Two Bob-Olympia winner Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thuringia came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to their Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on place three.
For me it was supercool, first podest place at the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I am superfroh with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and said: "It's not only a push, but there is also a lot to do.
Jamanka resented a little about the non-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction".
I had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I haven't received it, so I can't get it.
By corona I had different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he was said to have gone out of the way.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to give it back and then order again, since it is just reduced :).
Why does shipping start on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your site.
No, when I type it, there is an extra field with the message.
Was taken yesterday from your colleague.
Why is this a Problem Today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivered.
But we want the shelf module anyway, a new unharmed one.
And not to cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
hello love girls and girls and women.
I have something I just want to write and maybe it's one - or others like it...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogma - except that my dog is not screaming or in the kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J) is sick, has got a burn 2 degrees fetched on Monday and is depressive for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have boiled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him when showering (because hand is in the band wg combustion).
He is chilled at the top and we see less (1-2x week) what makes me very much with my needs for affection and love.
My dog’s child has just cooked for him, I’ve cooked for him, and now he’s lying in his cuff’s blanket and has a bit of relaxed after having a heat lamp and smiling for him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and that is straight for a month.
Now we have to share our housework.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is quite well set, I'm well therapies and I'm right.
Not good, but I'm right and I'm almost symptom free.
My university just requires a lot of time (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not yet done and will take anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral examination on Tuesday, and what comes in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place anymore.
So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then is weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just before...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental points, because otherwise I pack the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but differently I do not.
Are they?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
Really infinitely thankful, I can't even write in words.
Do not know if I would otherwise have survived my kpts.
I think this also has some things to do with Mental Load of Women, so I thought I'd find passionate women here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has printing.
During the first delivery was the color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we now exchange the table I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
For the rest, two times.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found at the time in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and there is only one other subject for them, like Mathe or Erdkunde.
For me this was always something strange, maybe also because I was born Christian and I always believed that way.
What do you think of it?
You may also be able to tell from work or college colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
Is there also called curriculum etc.
But it is simply strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What does one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
Culture is true or so?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can not change it or do not write English that I understand well.
That’s a long time, I’d look away.
Is good, thank you.
I expect to receive a response at the latest at the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Searching Aid Please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (about 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two time axis (or parallel worlds).
For one, the Modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (Uniform similar to that of the soldiers of the Caribbean curse).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself I mean.
The transition is also I believe the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this is something I am grateful for any response.
Our little one sleeps from week 1 to only on the stomach.
Fast forward: Still live :D
Relax.
Such a child thinks much more than one thinks.
Make sure that everything is right around the corner, no cuddly animals, sometimes slip and look, but no minute monitoring.
That makes you mad!
Clean air in the room.
The room was clean and comfortable.
No cushion.
Ahso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it be something from the belly?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can decide whether everything is fine.
We have all become great and when my husband came to the world, it was about time and there were the kids to sleep on the belly.
In addition, we are already a regular customer and have already bought a lot of articles.
But why do you offer me only 20 EUR?
Hello, yesterday I wrote with a colleague of you and so far no feedback.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is not currently used.
To be clear about it.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this transmitter is now under all sue.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time to go on a big bed tour.
It was said that one is an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be a running lid.
What is now?
A 0815 advertising station that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course for everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They must, of course, continue to offend the people.
A crocodile who lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms trying to make ashes.
How to find it all?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a wake-up call because my delivered wooden table was broken.
Corrupt by damaged delivery of #RS_ORG#.
Whether as a scaffolder or simply a squeegee – My small warmth friend is versatile.
Cherryker pillows are a traditional home-made solution for beneficial heat applications, because cherry cores can absorb and restore warmth.
The removable inner pillow can be easily warmed up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft look makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel at home, even if they aren't doing so well.
The cherry core pillow with reference is only suitable for the following fields of application:
Before warming the pillow, check for untypical odours, floor or fire stains and immediately dispose of it when it is present.
Please take the inner cushion to warm up beforehand!
Warm up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for 2 minutes (according to the microwave manufacturer!).
Directly after heating the heat is spread evenly in the pillow!
Then put the inner pillow to the fore.
During the first warming, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, which disappears in repeated applications.
Keep in mind that there are no signs of warming, because longer times or higher energy can lead to damage (deflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instruction manual.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back in relation, please check the temperature of the pillow on suitability for babies (max.
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverary diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, blood sugars and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensations.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was not loaded by my power supply anymore.
This I bought 5 months ago, should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is also sufficient for operation.
Missing display, the battery is empty and the laptop doesn't start up despite the plug-in power supply.
I then expanded the battery, but there is nothing here.
Do you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want to deliver the #RS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But do not know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still much equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 litres versions also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely contaminated using the cushioned FlexFold-parts.
And what else you need in everyday life, thanks to practical access in an individually configurable interior, remains well-organized and separated from the photo equipment.
With the “Update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series is still in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that reliably protect the backpack's interior while providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally through the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a metal shutter with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
In contrast to most of the backpacks, Peak Design has covered several “fills”: there are 4 anchor beams, stable, in which the hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Folding closures and hooks are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can be reliably closed without shaking the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other backpacks.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to go through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the daily use of the backpack: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more details below) and so you can easily trust each other separately - and you can access them independently by the two side openings.
You can also drag the rucksack from the right hand side to the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right-hand compartment, while everyday things remain in the left-hand rucksack and do not come between.
Easy, uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And because the outer shell of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately I waited for the email from their support.
#NAME# gave me an email confirming the order.
Contact from the forwarding company to pick up the wrongly delivered table announced.
Until now I have not received any news.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, no one came further than the promise that I received a mail as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrong delivered custom #NAME#.
It is worth noting that the wardrobe could be delivered again?
To keep him so is no option for me...
It works.
Thank you for helping me.
Would you like a nice evening?
hello, my orderer is #NUMBER#, when is the article delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.2.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order, but at the same time I have retained the damaged piece of furniture and will not be returned.
And that the last year was different from what I thought I was not able to look at and haven't solved it in a timely manner.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern slope of the American River discovered luminous rocks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the novelty spread rapidly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” from ‘49.
Thousands of people came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were laid off, tents stopped, and saloons and hotels emerged almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues to not go with the rest of them pleat.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose simultanely your actions, have to deal with your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called “Engine Building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to gain additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can create your individual game style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years of 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California acquired the official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will be able to choose a location at the same time, where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one-half of the site - reducing the number of actions.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, placing tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening businesses and positioning revolving heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The prize winner turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes so long until the price of goods has moved five times, i.e. every location is hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting shop in which players must defend Coloma from an assault on angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolving heroes and are superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score.
The player with the most points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power.
The ARD documentation is in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
The children psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff likes to be a guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce education debate.
Former patients: insiders and guardians now charge heavy charges against him.
Please fit on you, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsibilities must never, never, go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for his development and to make the framework for the child as big as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still shaken.
Holeschek: Countries for triple vaccinated
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide path to testing for three-fold vaccinators.
"We countries need clarity quickly, whether and from when, for three times, vaccinated the test obligation," said Klaus Holeschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, "Picture on Sunday".
The path of 2G plus for three times vaccinated is not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holeschek.
German health minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the health ministers' conference on the next Tuesday.
So I Want to Return the Light
What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I find the #RS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can not see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do shopping with my #PRS_ORG#.
Show: Ups, there has been an error.
Purchasing via the #PRS_ORG# page on your computer.
I updated my account data.
What can be done?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sense perceptions under general anaesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most common is to listen to sounds/voices, more rarely to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: Imperial cuts are associated with increased rates of Awareness, since it avoids very deep narcosis to protect the child until they are absent.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcotic conversation.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are accompanied by a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of me describes Awareness correct, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read their comment wrong.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately we don't help the 20€.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in eCommerce.
Please check again if you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair then private.
We also lose some money.
I already sent you a mail that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is it?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture in the first floor.
will I not call?
I asked a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle died 97-year.
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an artist.
He later wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
Here is the new book on the table: "An old man is older".
The chilling diarium of a slow farewell to the world, which led the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I'm witnessing my life."

Rounding Tips & Tricks
I got here a week ago many great tips for the perfect gulag.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tasty!
So thank you again :).
Now I came to taste and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time in New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any tips for me?
Note: I have no stove, but only a big pot.
What Next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it.
It is a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I have already been notified by mail that the refund was made.
But, until today, the money has not gone to me.

The VT+ series amplifiers also offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which can be used to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and the distortion.
Furthermore, the POWER LEVEL controller is already able to get even a power reserve if it doesn't sound bad.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone book can also be used as a line output.
The signal shown here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or direct shot.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX connector so that you can jam on your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 footer, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn on and off the effect blocks and "tap" the tempo of the corresponding compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step in the future!
But it was seen by others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me?
And the Comedy?
Will we receive an update for the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they have been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs.
If not, I would be happy with a discount or voucher.
In some circumstances I find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 Euro for the goods I do not need are there a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and waiting time has not paid off.
Is there a Premium Customer Status for you?
Iran views progress on negotiating the Nuclear Deal
In negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear deal, Iran’s data show progress.
"The two sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran’s chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first I didn't even agree on the issues to be dealt with.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had continued after just a week’s interruption.
Trade negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free state now state with the highest coronavirus incidence.
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest federal incidence.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia is located at the Corona-Incidence on Sunday above the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute issued the Seven Day Value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last but not least had the highest incidence nationwide, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but also had above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections were reported with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection.
200 patients with COVID-19 have been treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, notice delays may occur.
Moreover, health-care agencies have been overloaded for weeks, and are barely behind when new cases are recorded.
I understand this.
As the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick to the package and leave it at the post, that was or?
here I do not have to click/delivele/fill?
I want to avoid that, so I write to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a matter of my opinion.
It’s Time for Change
###M federal day are greeted, I'm u/StratorDE in the Plenar Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the federal state, you can see one thing: it is not existential.
We came into a winter barn and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what is it?
Most of all, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have expired here, and how we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many still have a back on the federal government.
#What We Must Change
At this point, the community is asked around the German Bundestag to keep it alive.
The implication came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days, and one, just said, has found upheaval.
After a while, several people have found themselves in the community who want to rebuild the project.
However, once again I would like to urge all to participate, only so this project can continue in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, where we can exchange ourselves and develop concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the federal government function in the future?
* Which orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we be outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm quite sure that I have forgotten something, but that is not bad, we have the discord at the end.
If you have time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp screen with you that is still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/color and not suitable for my taste.
For this I already ordered a different suspension.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, is there also in excess size, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to make that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# may contact me at any time to arrange a pick up date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long should I have time to take care of it or to opt for the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has lived for a while vegetarian, is rarely even meat at the moment.
I was a vegetarian several years ago.
When asked whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking.
While I thought that I would support the animal welfare as a vegetarian, I eventually reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal goods.
So my decision to be vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that came up on her side of suspicion, she then defended vegetarianism and told her to know where her meat comes and how to reduce animal suffering as vegetarians.
Now I wonder if my answer was “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as vegans are quickly put into a corner and get up without any conflicts.
It greets a harmonizing vegan (;
Clearly, it is not an exception in accordance with Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not remove you from the legal requirements for remote data.
I am on the assigned date where #PRS_ORG# my return will not take place.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, this can't be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I am back in time.
Lahnstein’s Water Rescue: €45,000 from the Country
Recently, in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus, the interior minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz handed over a €45,000 grant for the new equipment car water rescue of the Volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein an Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country Rhineland-Palatinate supports us here," says Labotte, Chief of the Lord Mayor.
The equipment car is used by the diver squad Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They perform water and ice rescue tasks as well as technical assistance.
The boom of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the cargo as a leisure flow contributes to this.
I bought a book which I could read only 10% and then the problems began.
I cannot open the book.
But I followed their recommendations but have synchronized, removed, and the app reloaded NOTS has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and hope for help now.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection from #RS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

Thank you for making the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also talking about weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go on!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistic.
But, in principle, it should be said that, of course, the public servants are more likely to come from the liberal and conservative spectrum, not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That of course, even in the special uniform and weapons refer people to the right of the right should also be clear to everyone that these people can naturally cope with the lived reality is also very difficult to handle, of course, because of course you have, of course, in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't mean that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because this in the executive there aren't so much, but ordinary men and women who can't remember it if they're not told them) and also these people, and I must also leave me, because in doubt, in doubt, save you save your life or set up this for yourself.
But these fringe groups, too, even if it sounds strange to my experience of a conservative stance, are proud of Germany, and feel less fetched by excessive left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposed to work for them or are supposed to do it right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, of course, because police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly tell their opinion there, or even openly forge any state-imposed plans are medial exaggerated and annoying me.
Of course, even police and soldiers who were often abroad were often able to pause because of negative experiences, and sometimes things say that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also possible that even right-wing connoisseurs may meet, who have a lively exchange of ideas.
However, my opinion is well addressed and it is also countered by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very international and I think that we could not afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German page.
Why should England do so?
When I ordered was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or it is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner.
but above on the edge of the wooden part are two deep pits filled with some yellow.
and the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Ordinary by Child?
Hello, me (w32) busy one thing already longer.
I'm very disciplined and organized on the job, (myself, very little spare time), but I'm getting it worse than right down my budget permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up.
But it isn’t really that “someone could spontaneously visit.”
My husband is ( unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household simply loses to work and loss.
The kitchen is cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more properly with a child?
We don't have anything but work on it, and this question has been for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as there is no visit and i.e. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do children have a greater incentive or do they stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insurance personality disorder?
I've made a training in software development and I've been learning software development for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I always remember that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insurance (or anxious) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means that I have no sense of self-esteem and that I am accordingly shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people at the same level, but it's hard for me to make loose conversations and I've been told more often that I'm working inconvenient (which I've already got better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, the search consultancy or family support.
But I don't know if the daily work is really as I imagine it and it's hard to find something on the internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("it is already the easiest things to do again") and it's hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help. "I'd really know how to do that"/"I'll keep it with my stupid questions from work"/"I'll have to keep me true for inferior" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it in the place.
The sofa did you get back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I Wait for a Meeting
What do you mean by returning !
If I downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, the message will be #PRS_ORG# authorized this book.
are there problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) obtained with the feed isolating the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual proteins (amino acids) and in turn builds up its own proteins, which it also needs to be fertilized.
The formation of the nestling and the re-education of the nesting birds are very complex procedures and for the overall organism of the animal with a particularly high strain.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, otherwise it may occur to malfunctions in the breeding process.
Following this curable dose of NEKTON-Bio, it should be transferred to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral hydrogen preparation).

It is recommended to prepare only as much water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A painted measuring spoon (included) equals 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
The double or triple dose of NEKTON bio can be given at the beginning of the year until the re-education approach becomes visible.
After that, the normal dose will be taken until the recovery is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to tell that my order has been damaged and pictures attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Responding to the Articles of Association in return to the Articles of Association.
Hi r/Legaladvice German,
I have the following problem.
There is a walnut tree on our property.
So request to be made to the community.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, the Waluss is explicitly stated as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your responses
We understand this.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message.
Well, then I still have a soft without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What, then, were more expensive?
Yes, I think only the question is yes, whether I can pay in euros and send me the blanket to Germany.
Can you examine this?
The Own Message
A heavy traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the connecting station Selb-Nord and Pössberg.
As the press arm of the police has announced today (14:03), a car has arrived in the traffic during the overtaking.
There are casualties.
Ah okay understand.
Well, thank you again that it went so easy!
Ratings and Ideas for Competitive Work
For the first time, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is moderately good, because my head is just breaking everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here now .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation - i.e.
I’m just doing the reform as a crossover.
Originally I've studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't call this more precise).
The whole thing was too boring and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some time I am at the apprenticeship office and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that doesn't matter to me.
I have arrived at the third "I google other vacancies".
And it is only half a year around.
At the times before I have always decided to go further and at least to finish the reform, after that I can still change.
But I’m absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month, which I am completely exhausted.
Now are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the reform I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening my holiday.
I was free.
And the stress on work was no matter in the moments.
Now myself is the family celebration too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that also annoying me.
Basically it makes it fun and from the outside, the Ref also runs well what the feedback and so on.
But I am completely insulated and wonder how much stress my body stops before being completely dense - if it does not.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of the work life - just when I read some posts from you - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was valued, I was able to take me free time when I needed them, and the work was somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and together in a team what worked and not as single fighters as this is the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if I'm not back in a year at the same place as now and unhappy.
You notice, it's all somehow weird, but maybe you as an outside council or ideas, as I came out of this situation, which I am completely finished and almost at the smallest thought to cry out.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas - that is enough for me for the first time.
Thanks for reading and apologize for the soft undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been constantly evolving, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait for authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
These amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix pre-amplifiers.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed casing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only rinse.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and correct historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound like you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which has led to a further boost in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 – with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists will find here a maximum of sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a smooth sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and strings, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the final stage determines the tube character of a amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this findings.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, makes the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfect.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers.
The defeat of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but not enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable velcros, it is designed to meet the requirements of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes up to full-format SLR cameras.
What fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
One possible component would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three removable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLR cameras such as the Sony-A7 series models or Fuji X-T2 let room for more lenses.
You can also find a lot of accessories.
And who has a small DSLR (MFT-camera from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for other things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavi Pro including remote control and accessories.
La Palma’s Volcanic Extinction
In the last three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available about previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-named volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists continued to dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state television channel RTVE.
The Loss of Million
In the last three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to nearly 1700 football pitches.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
On the coast there were two new lands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
The island was heavily affected by the immensely important banana cultivation, about half of which lives directly or indirectly, or indirectly, before the volcanic eruption in the crisis.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is in front of the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and thrilling excitement, have something to be tempting.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologists Marcel Mauss, has been a peaceful "social contract of natural people" that escapes rigid routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Wasted
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the present.
Prior to this, gifts were handed over to one or the other on Nikolaustag.
The background of this still popular site is that Saint Nicholas as Bishop of Myra three women in a night secretly thrown gold in her window to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the custom popular in Germany was to fill the boots above all the children with gifts.
Protestants came to this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "secret worship".
For these reasons, they hold against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind from the Nicholas and established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifted to the Christmas Eve.
As most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to Martin’s use with Martinssingen and Martinsumzug, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you will find everything you need in boots and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all of the Christian countries, however, there is a joyous teddy bear on the question of who is giving gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christmas Child appears in the Holy Week, or the Christmas man who is, in principle, a kind of Nicholas, who has been assigned some properties over time.
This includes, for example, his white colour of noise, which has little in common with the rather strict assyrian representation of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas at Christmas is the central figure.
In Spain, the saints of Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, which has given them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, at times, fables bring gifts, while in Russia it brought frost to some glory.
Here it is not rentier, but three horses that pull his sleigh as troika.

Police Meaning Presumed Bankers Near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told that callers had reported a man who had gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped little later by officials.
Shoes were fallen and the man had been hit.
He was still explained in the deed for dead.
The police did not run out of a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that flourish in color.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is a “smart stone”: the sun alone makes the solar light fascinating – either in white or colored light (in six different shades of colour).
The no-nonsense, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: as a natural formed large gravel, this modern light object is presented by day.
Its organic roundings fit into any natural environment – on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
He is also well-known in the vicinity of larger pebbles and finders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his greatness.
Large screenings can be saved: as a solar light »Smart Stone« requires no infeed or batteries.
Set the "Lightstone" to any place of the day of the sun.
Two supplied ground pistons ensure firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charged when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of sudden dusk, »Smart Stone« starts to illuminate yourself; in what colour you determine yourself: six attractive light colours are at your choice – in addition to natural light – for your choice.
Also switching off is done automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a given minimum or it becomes lighter.
As soon as the sun is shining again, the charging cycle begins the next day.

The Pillars Problem
Hello dear female,
I hope I do everything right, after one year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I started to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so unbelievably bad pain during the period and screaming PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this out again, because I have to take enough medication because of chronic diseases, which I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pistols I got them everywhere.
As far as this is superficial, but I was very impressed and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years pause the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe there are some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are free of perfumes, but maybe there's something I can recommend.
Unfortunately, female nurses did not take me so seriously and the doctor arrives.
Thanks to everyone for reading the novel!
Yes the loving skin is so ne thing.
Had pre-popular bad neurodermitis, then a time rest, then large-area nodules and the acne theme.
Diet I have also tried everything possible in the course of chronic illness and have remained on a meal of sugar, milk and poor meat, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm inside, but if you like me, you don't want to go looking for anything else.
I already had all of her colleague semina o. a.
and now I lost the conversation and do not know what was answered on my request.
I always have to work on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what to check if the money was there, I had seen it?
Please check my bank details, maybe there was wrong.
but there is it in general in large.
because it is available in black.

Hello, unfortunately I do not enter the customer account.
Could you send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the above address?
The material of the packaging can we dispose of?
We have no options to keep them for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.
Do the wardrobe have to be completely dismantled for collection and refund?
and when would the deforestation be?
The 110-kV Earth Cable is built in 2022.
The permission for the new high-voltage cable from Tann is valid.
The Federal Government's resolution of the plan frees the way for the construction that will begin in 2022.
This is now part of the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long earth cable will connect the Tann converter in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolts line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a master of the release line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good Tomorrow,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts of us.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with #NUMBER# has been returned by #PRS_ORG# with the name "Additional not possible".
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how to do this?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget that I told yesterday several times!!
This is a combination of glass and the entire sides are placed, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken.
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the comma cannot be picked up, because no one is allowed to slip into my apartment.
Thanks for the News
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it's for all books, so the query is #PRS_ORG# because it's a general problem.
Re: Lessons plan (EK).
Hello dear colleagues,
Since summer I am in the Ref that makes me fun, but I still have big problems to plan my teachings in the field of earth science.
Unfortunately my school isn't technically equipped at all, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, in the school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for edifices).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
We do, for example, the topic of geospatial factors.
In principle, the methods always repeat, but on the other hand I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (which I need for UBs etc.).
I always go out of the learning goal (which I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the work in the book I am rather unhappy.
So the worksheets.
Maybe I can have a pedigree like you can work with the book at a time.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I've already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I'd like to take the retour as soon as possible.
Trading fears Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated are allowed to eat or eat.
Trade is holding that for unnecessary and claims sales incursions.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations derive from the view of the German Chamber of Commerce (HDE) from the retail trade the important Christmas business.
In the case of transactions with non-daily items, sales drops should be complaining, HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey by HDE under 1100 dealers, more than 70% of companies looked negatively to the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive culmination of the year is now often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions therefore lost just about one-third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It works well only in food retail and online business.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the chief executive.
"2G in purchasing does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he said.
The current rules discouraged customers and required high human resources.
The band rules have to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer must be controlled only once on 2G (victims or genes) and would have access to all shops with the received tapes on that day.
Moreover, in the retail sector - as in public transport in the 3G rule (injected, genetic or tested) - sample controls should be sufficient.
Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were at least 75% of the prior-Corona level, with no 2G.
These figures will now fall safely in the midst of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economics Week".
Due to the high level of personnel and administrative effort, the Centers are trying to find solutions and to get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, where, for example, the visitors at a central location in the center once again provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that was tried with a yellow filler to be cascading.
That looks uneasy.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already put it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for the retour now?
The lamp is designed for dual- balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities ensures the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flames.
The 120-degree exposure angle with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
Also in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both film set and studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficult accessible locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included).
Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory cards, you simply press one of the memory keys for a longer period of time.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp while it is switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery, one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before set whether the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery tester equal to each of the two battery compartments - a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply power to the headlights via the included power supply.
Building the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for mounting, so you can get directly to your photo motif.
The inclination can be adjusted reliably on both sides by means of attachments.
It has been taken care that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard work.
In addition, a wrist is included in the package.
This bag is also included in the package.
This way you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
I have paid for the damage and it is too small :().
"Party, which we wanted to shoot": Frankfurt is celebrating after a long comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two wins in the series were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga lead.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration of an adult season start from the soul and triumphed furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the guys have done today," cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke of a "Pauschal-Lob," to everyone who was involved.
At the beginning, it looked like a new shock absorber for Frankfurt, still ahead of its expectations.
Patrick Schick had brought the Leverkusener to the lead with 2:0.
What happened was also impressed by the SGE trainer.
"However, the players have returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glarner said.
I am really happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
He was also the first player to be able to stand up again for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is unbelievable," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to shoot today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glaser wants to keep the focus on itself, but sees itself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top-level constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now you want to go on step by step and stay modestly" and "do the tasks up to the change of the year "on this level".
The next one will be on the programme already in the course of the English week, with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 a.m., Sky).
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred and the order is returned?
Couldn't say that I'm not going to order again because it took a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Champions for Handball Women vs. Spain
Germany’s Handball-women, after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes of the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at the 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers was a fierce defeat and must now compete against host Spain in the quarter-final.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," states trainer Henk Groener.
Spain needs to be different.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany completed the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a pity that we could not take the flow.
That was a bad game of all that we must delete," said Captain Emily Böl.
In the battle for entering the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup II of 2019 next Tuesday, in order to keep the soft dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German Werferin in the Duell with the three-time Olympic Champion Denmark was the backinge player Alina Grijsels with six goals.
"We weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, who asked: "We must now look forward quickly.
From the front to the rear not on the Height
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the high.
Bugs and technical failures in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 back after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at work temperature and prevented with some parasites worse.
The first goal was to reach the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseel successfully completed a rapid strike.
The hoped-for initial ignition, however, was not.
German women could hardly be in the scene against the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
For example, at the 3:10, the match was set early in 20 minutes, at the time, backstage playmate Mia Zshade saw a little later because of a hard foul at her rival Red.
In the quarter final, however, it is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half the DHB selection came a bit better into the game and up to the break at least five goals.
The only quiet hope for a catch-up hunt after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener referees all over the world, making it easy for the well-funded opponent to be among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer get up to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

Is this about them?
The title exists, I am a physicist in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is v.a. v.a. in nursing homes.
As these are soon finished to a large part, it goes partly to the vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not personally related to one (e.g. "I take medicine X, is responsible for the vaccination.").
In my field of work, the Enlightenment for the Vaccine, the Indicator (person is entitled to a vaccine for corona vaccination, and no reasons to talk about it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care of allergic reactions (I have never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical personnel.
In immunization teams, however, we often don't have anything, but "just" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but who can't perform vaccines, so that I can do most of the vaccines themselves.
Serious "Huidler" Question: Amberger knows the Solution
What please is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television show "We in Bavaria" has been stirred up with intense reflection.
However, unlike many previous days, the term "host mi?" was not mentioned by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "man who is nervous".
And no one, "that everything must go fast".
That, people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg provided the solution, and thus, even in the case of many Oberpfälzers, it was a surprise.
"The Huidler", experienced the viewer, "is a lamp with which someone wipes the stove".
This was confirmed by dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been an expert on Bavarian television for years.
With the comment that this is a typical superficial term, derived somehow from the more familiar word of mouth "houdern".
What a gap in education was closed - probably also for a number of people who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I can't buy books for 2 weeks.
It comes after the confirmation always following error: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
tyre choice at the race bike - really so exciting?
Tomorrow morning I was awakened because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour in the coming week.
Suggested, done and I drove with my bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in every downtown (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud tongue and my back tyre wanted to do the rest of the track in any case.
Due to the fact that I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and spare hose due to the weekdays, I had to turn around home with halfway bad mood and take the first track home.
If it wasn't that bad, maybe it's better if I practice the tyre change before the bike tour.
Now I face a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long track over several days before me, I would be very pleased to get this problem more often.
Now it wasn't bad, as even the old tyres from the front-passenger (very nice old man, on the day I got the bike up to 2 p.m.!
But if I think I have to change the tyre when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly lamented :D.
Now I came to the talk with an older man at the train station who wondered me why I didn't have the marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unbearable.
Now, of course, it sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unchallenged?
I have little desire to spend 40€/trips, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore I wonder: I have at the moment on the bike I think 25x622.
This is also available at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tyres at a racing bike?
The Schwalbe site seems to recommend my absolute!
Thank you very much in advance for the help and dear greetings!
A Car Killed Against Tree: Drivers Deadly

After the release of our new High End Breeding Band B 100 - 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would again be available again.
SOLO 15 is the new springling and reminds visually of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct sound position.
It has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people with the maximum volume playing a rather inferior role, but can be achieved with an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large noise levels.
But this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal has been tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common for wide bands to optimize the high frequency of the band.
The SOLO 15 with its very clear and fine sound is perfectly aligned to the auditorium.
Easily rotated outside, the high-tone range can be reduced, making the sound image more warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharpened and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic look for the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution capacity and battery capacity.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning to plan for changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to change the housing, you need to adjust the lowering of the loudspeaker, since the veneer is applied again.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place to perform the cable without any problems.
With the help of an upper mill the loudspeaker opening is followed in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used in parallel.
The opening should be provided with a 45° fibre to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible.
The four screw-in points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted, as shown in the image "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two sides on a flat surface.
Now the backwall, the lid, the front and the ground are mounted.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if needed, for example, if you want to use finished bars from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
The second page will be displayed in the next step.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forstner drill, the opening of the bass reflex tube and the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Then you use a circular milling machine to round off all edges of the actual box.
The topside of the footboard can also be rounded.
The footboard is bonded firmly with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
The following is the indication and forging (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection clamps.
After the case of wood dust has been cleaned (washing / blowing), you begin to lay the cable.
This is the simplest result of the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
At the same time, the entire and shortened wire is shifted to a piece by the 8 mm drilling in the foot up to the terminal opening.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable leads to the loudspeaker opening.
The frequency difference is then prepared and used.
The installation plan of the frequency deviations as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation guide Softe Solo 15.
If the frequency switches are installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal is followed by the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, it is possible to drop hot sticks on the opening and close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follow the stunting as described.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is attached and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this process, so that the plus wire (marked cables) must be sold to the speaker's plus pole (grey contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and plugged into the specified length of 28 mm (the total length of the pipe).
For damping a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
Opening around the bass reflex channel should be freed.
Can I place an order now and send it to the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> finally we can announce that this year we will host the OSCAST again!
> We are not able to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which means a higher planning effort and the short-termity of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it is still pandemic – but we will do everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> There will be about 0:30.
Have a good time with your friends or family.
