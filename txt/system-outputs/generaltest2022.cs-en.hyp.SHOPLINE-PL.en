The big comeback of the Czech smoker is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult time of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 30-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the AC and could soon reach the goal as well.
Former goalkeeper Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game with Vegas, he has changed and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when an experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out of approximately three to four weeks with lower-body injuries," said the Denver unit at the beginning of October.
His return to goaltending in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, the American time was called out of the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The student of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had hip problems and did not catch a single match in the short pandemic year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, its success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a veil on Camille on a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as a Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo on which Camille will take her on the races to help put on a veil.
The British news station BBC reported on this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, it is not even clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile in her country house in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also published a Christmas card image.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who has a top hat and a veil on his head, helps Camille put on her veil color-coordinated with the bright dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for her title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with Roman Berbr, the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, to have been promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018 / 19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got to a part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that no corrupt behavior was possible.
The server published a transcript of the police wiretapping in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, figures mainly.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for gaining the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Praha officials should have a million bribe to win in the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal negotiations, we have never sought to affect referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context, "Tvrdík said for the Zpravy list.
Nezmar will insult some former dark-skinned Slavia players in wiretapping, among other things, and he will also avenge his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through arbitral tribunals was sparked last year by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like Vyšehrad's former sports director, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but in principle of a worse type (gunners must take cartridges from the armored cabin and carry cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, it was possible to get rid of Praga V3S even for specialized units.
Planes: Combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
PVO: Central - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
They were climbing nutrients from the river and damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped to leave before anything came to light, but, of course, in a while a fox went.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost laughed, he was head-on to all sides, so I called to him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of my seat there was a mess.
I.e. even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, that would have to be a interplay of many coincidences to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal image that almost everyone has today.
So to a visible place, put expensive things at your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be cool.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Respirators found themselves significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy an auction?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stores of technology that could take up trained, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly lose weight over time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists / territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can lead, and it is also a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in the conflict of such scale and intensity, where guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have the right geography for that.
Above all, we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act as if they had it.
Then this comes to pass such a situation that you watch a guy who didn't hit an empty net 2 minutes ago drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they vote for him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "trick" skill is so terrible that I'm honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent's players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, it will last for some time in hospitals, and, as we know, a new unknown has added to the pandemic equation: A omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the Covid equation this week: The possibility of treatment.
A new drug, an antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and it is possible to treat them at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports the success rate of 85 percent so far.
However, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools suitable for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic also highlighted the question of how the local administration is ready for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will first reach domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape, even because the drug began to developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how the beaks grew up to us".
See you do a research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you without circumstances that no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist beasts.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west looks good, the east seems bad.
But they will find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both, according to surveys, have over 20%.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to study where what is happening again, all objects on the hair are the same.
Of the one, there is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want nuclear warheads to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either for reasons of safety or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads and rockets, as they say, were kept.
If it was necessary to put on this weapon, a special unit was arrived to pick up this head and mount it on some carrier device.
In addition, museum maples, are the rest in a desolate condition.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate Gypsies, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but it was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often walked with him and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he went cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, other classes, entered the same year.
Shortly after that, there were often police dealing with something there, they threatened and threatened other students...
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called in a month that he had already transferred it to himself...
I myself say I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other as long as they act as they are in a decent society (works, works, women don't, just don't take normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he reaches out his hand, clears the apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color he is, but will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start business, work with us, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care for as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will also respect their traditions and culture.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who carried the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for so far unknown reasons drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After a collision with Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle finished on the roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not supply data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, newly he must add VAT and hand over the post office data for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officers are expecting the package to come.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT on sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not take care of the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkbox, put in two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year they added me 2% in gross, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business they run at work.
Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his / her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and overall.
And not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob logically helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom a warrant for arrest was issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went wrong.
At first, he approached the passerby and made up for a story that he was robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted advice from the officers on how to submit a notification to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore resolved by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we have not been ethnically or culturally Slavic for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with my meme, a shame that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the US: ')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence only because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree to Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world if I don't drink, something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods do you have to choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who punishes you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the tenth place, it is stated that there is no other god other than the one of Jesus.
So in such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing wrong of the thousands of gods, and the one real god that I just didn't punish will send me to hell or to a similar place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in reserves.
I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry has been constantly floundered, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of blending, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or, for example, a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
He will come to me funny as you consider NATO to be something stone-cropped, we have allies, and they will therefore defend us if there is a pruser.
Well please, man.
Just one election in the US is enough to screw their budget and the whole NATO goes to a pick.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown once that they are enough to show their backs and will take what they want.
The only thing that has long been working as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, as it would not have been.
We don't need border fortifications, that's for the first time today, but hit a teenager behind a stick of a remote-controlled device.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is full of boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That is why it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
After agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging that is currently in short supply on the market and also money saved, as packaging cardboard has become more expensive by 50% recently.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling material will be brought to Popůvek u Brňské by individuals who accumulate at home, we are also contacted by companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything in the packaging of shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It is used as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take away sorted household waste, where to hand over expired drugs, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Rather, I feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but it does not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (especially in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency before the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be managed in half a year.
However, French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of the breakup between the right and the left agree on a male, but in Europe, yes.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such a work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately commentated with criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right French presidential candidate, Éric Zemmour, is currently driving around France with the benefits that the Vichy regime, which he collaborated with Hitler in World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with it in the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries tend to learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated in which battle.
But if they have no enlightened cantor, they will no longer learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held first place on the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy / fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was about like "having a flu / being a purple-cropped" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to common flu, it was worse.
I have no diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it go for a common life.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday, trains according to the new timetable are starting to run on the railway.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time, or even their route slightly, will be adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the dormitories.
Carriers started selling tickets already during the autumn.
The Czech Railways plans to run on average 6,783 passenger transport connections per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be Interjet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 route Ústí nad Labem - Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will travel a total of 16 connections on the track every day, eight in each direction.
Other changes apply to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářík, despite planned exclusive works, the carrier tried to keep its long-distance trains as running as similar as possible.
The operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
For example, passengers await changes in the Czech Republic, where the trains of the German company Die Landermann will run on the track from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere, we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
In my life, I have not heard classes from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks often sold themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you at school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they were murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone intentionally hiding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we are already with those southern states, yes, the confederation flag and famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also have some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in South Africa was slavers and a lot of things were also against them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT, where they will leave someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that it was terrible at some universities, those students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them as many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since reached what it had and it is no longer the same, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact are called feminists, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in the end, I also did not come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual: D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If something with people connects me with such interests, views of the world and common experience, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very good guy, the sermons are more about theology than politics, but then they always agree about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholicism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to Hussite services, because it is theologically very similar, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael's Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3: 00 p.m. they make mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic even this time, in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in every year with the section, I'm looking forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing changes regarding the delivery of flambé in the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally went by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the parish bishop Vojtěch Cikrlel.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep an distance, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply behave in such a way that it was as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokesman for the Bethlehem light event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light traveling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame at the same time.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvětlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money properly, but I don't understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices "xy financed / co-financed by the xy project" in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the retardation of development when this company adheres to and takes orders / employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its termination
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born Internet time is also caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think Internet ads won't move with me, but then I'm just as likely to affect me - it's just so overwhelming that you can't always resist it.
That is also why I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all a candleholder, in the words of a classic one - I would disable the Internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'll claim is critical thought"
2. "After all, I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
The TV has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present their viewers with a record-breaking more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been affected by audience viewers in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so these films are getting more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their name, so in reality holiday movies will be much more.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came to light in a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, then included four movies and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the agenda, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, it doesn't matter much about the story again, it's important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that they're snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday craziness and craziness of the world we've been living in for at least two hours," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, however, successfully resolved and those kiss.
This is how it is all the time, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.

Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack on a better position from the 20th place he went in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will finally not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will go on to the track from the last place, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, while safety will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved, "her representatives said for Formula1.com.
He will not or cannot send a replacement driver to the Haas race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi " had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings in it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters have never worn much with us at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work within half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were delivered by Swarovski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
"Wool and cotton are the basis, but silk will give the sweater softness," praising the creator of his work, which, however, is not recommended to wish.
And it has one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater so far, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help the Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland officially asked NATO countries to help, in connection with the actions of the Belarus regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to their territory with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.

Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the ZŠ Adamov is not proven, "said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region in the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children from one of them, two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four risk free course.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of the mentioned traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, come into contact with anyone who resides abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
The main hygiene manager Pavel Svrčín previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was tested.
There were also players from South Africa on it, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to proceed as Texas in banning abortion.
California governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous US state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion detection of heart rate embryos.
People would then be entitled to compensation in lawsuits against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's position of the US Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in effect, although it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to apply across the US until the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged yesterday's (Friday) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said California governor.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use this power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work on measures in cooperation with the state parliament and the justice minister to authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers are designated and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation from at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, ghost "parts or kits for their production in California.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets, we should exactly do so," said the California governor.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June the federal judge struck down the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state had now really renewed the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US countries in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas did not grant full immunity to court review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses has already been widely valid from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should soon be on the market.

I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change the TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobr, the European Commission would act in contradiction with the law if it used new powers and stopped the payment of Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure of the European Parliament to go on and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a sentence on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in access to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent for Ziobr effect threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to subvert the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of a colony," he said.
But confess in it... With us in Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's true, in the narrow sector there were all the selected, uncommon and specialty cheeses in it, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If it's avoidable, I'm no longer going to any market anymore, I'm not going to take an action, I'm going to go gold shop on the square, maybe they don't have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don't really care anymore.
I have been watching data like manure here for two years, most of the vaccination opponents are just a little more out of line than most vaccination representatives.
Although rational discussion takes place at a professional level, only extreme opinions reach the public space.

Sorry for the climb and I wish you all a nice day.
They punished me with a wooden spoon in their childhood.
It was never due to grades, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I would do it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next "timed" wooden spoon only brought and put it in such a way that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few blows on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, it is important to me to see the part with a warning, because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether he will not listen and get it, or the punishment will be improved and the punishment will not be improved.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether the sacred document for which he swears and for which he learned at school from childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely leaning towards the first concept.
Once we have agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has become more and more and more common among lawyers.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right in one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, the constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set game rules for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
COVID doesn't choose, they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby in FN Brno
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novim.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially recently, "added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-COVID syndromes were at the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age," said the primary.
However, it is happy that no child deaths have yet been recorded in the coronavirus at the Children's Hospital of the Brno University Hospital.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist is in a children's hospital - not only at the coronavirus department.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"That's why we also recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb a fence into the field).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside of marked paths can't be anywhere if you don't have an exception (but of course it doesn't apply even so much outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music goes in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He is satisfied with the Liberec Opera and originally played on the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically all repertoire and works as a conductor not only in the F. Šalda Theater in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for not being able to stop the infection that was turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors often help in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with a trunk, the children play with him.
Well, she's just great.
If you want for 5,000, - I will sell you the elephant.
Friend: So well, Yes, it's going to be great...
After some time, they will meet and the one who has bought complains: Those who you sold it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, everywhere giant shit, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants to divorce.
What he sold says: You talk badly about an elephant, you won't sell a elephant this way...
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, this still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will lead.
It also occurred to me and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that these are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept, and it is not necessary to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just playing words: D
Whether it's the way it is, it's a ridiculous request

Vicki Holland tortured the monkey marmoset Milly from Britain
Horrifying footage shows the moment when the terrified monkey cowered in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed it up and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who take care of Milly after her abuse say they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother pleaded guilty to two accusations that she caused unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat and for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, her point of view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychological scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone after raiding her apartment due to drug accusations.
In the footage, it can be heard how Milly profanity profanity.
Another video shows Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to keeping cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found in her house for 1,600 pounds (roughly 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
As if you take away the same things in the breast as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffooning, when no one, with exception, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Without and on the street, you ask random people if they can manage to determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority will not even hide and tell you that they are completely in a pick.
So what the fuck is learning for?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need them.
And at that point it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need the thing they need.
But as well, the note that you really don't need all this for standing by the machine really doesn't need it all, I thought very seriously...... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly reach the time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and bullying against educated people and elites probably also play a part in us) However, the price that barbarians will simply be high among those machines will become our own.
For example, if journalists could count, the covid probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately, "Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
It was creaky between Kadri and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, i.e. at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He immediately dealt with Kadri's accusations of lying, gambling and debt in response to Andrea.
Even his younger sister Linda didn't like Kadri's supposed honesty now.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things at all and even in the family we've never really said these things very extra.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and beat the name of someone I like so much, I just can't get it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm more sorry for that when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in a confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao started his robbery trip in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he finally stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he didn't think anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment with an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
The footage from one security camera shows how he goes along the street away from the crime scene, while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank something of alcohol on a day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob him of drunkenness.
The whole thing is still in investigation.
The monkey climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and becomes effective tied to the pandemic emergency.
When it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Although the law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.

Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Election Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to "argue with".
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which after all was the goal for them to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what they do.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old one
Tl; dr: Believe, for example, in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operating center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
Upon arriving at the paramedic's place, they discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man should have fell out of the window from a height of about twelve meters and fell head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and firefighters went to the event.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue service team, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, ensured artificial pulmonary ventilation and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokeswoman of the EMS of the Ministry of Health of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than from the coronavirus from inadequate reactions of both the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are primarily on the first line of the fight against infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
There are things to do at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a defeater.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in a lightweight bond, he put a great choke on Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a female bantamweight match between famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňová.
The American entered the mutual battle as a imaginary "dwarf", because Nunesová had not lost for seven years and grinding her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the start of the duel took place in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively, and the opponent even pushed the kick she sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced to any other mistake, and she tried to attack with a lever on her arm herself unsuccessful.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents started with a lot of excellent blows and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock off the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the card gradually started to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to match the opponent with lever to hand.
He didn't do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and filled him with a number of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, on the other hand, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiv in the first round.
He then charged him with a number of exactly-aimed blows and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated her next triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are masculine, feminine and central.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they then acquire double endings and in some cases remain uninflected.
For example, the words "rope" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the first they inflected according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the "song".
For another group of nouns, different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example: "Rádek / rádka", "kedluben / kedluben / kodlubenna" or "/ brambor" (in the sense of food).
At the same time, both forms are literary, they have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example, "okurek" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is uninflected, there are also other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "Okure" and "kopa, "donut" and "donut" etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained uninflected in the central gender, but has endings according to the pattern of "castle" in the masculine gender.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to venture to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future for in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I experienced how often they are treated by their surroundings or the police.
The victims should always be trusted.
The trend has happened that victims finally open up about their traumas.
But still, only a lot of people keep it for themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations is made up of" and that it is only a "trend" you help sexual rapists.
The Czechia is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to complete
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of that.
She does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and even pay rent for it, "says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
In a year, we build two to three family houses and fifty percent of them happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult for us to abide by some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earning money, "said the owner of the construction company Zdeňěk Slivoň.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait, "added Slivoň.
Copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive of the materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, construction graduates are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We're doing well and we're doing better.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by the speeches of politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO, Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
As in that, the diploma looks great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor, I always work on it all year round and then I write a written part in a week or two.
Stateswomen are completely calm with us, if a person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him unnecessarily on theory.
For example, I learned a week at the stateswomen and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to guide me to some logical derivation that immediately came to me and I was right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they will teach them) and then they will just learn the project and they are sufficient.
In my opinion, it is great if there is an exam at the end of the course in which the knowledge gained in the project is reflected, not just a defense.
But don't hit everything ok with e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same pee as them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put her in such a way that she can kick Xi Jinping's ass or somehow.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you can't store stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether a lawyer, comment or save.
I'm very sorry lately, so maybe I'll have to reduce to tiktok, where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and can't almost commit to it.
In the end, I would also be happy if something more user-friendly came to light that doesn't drain all the creativity and energy of artists
Declaration of the Workers' Party of Donbass
The Union - yes, it will break - no, in the picture I express my opinion of the opponents of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Association of USR entities of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
One budget pen "canceled a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
By the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the Bialowieza Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, separated fourteen republics from the world's greatest power, which were previously economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the extinction of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all as a result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first of all, the socialist camp and the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "a vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly due to the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the fact that I will put it in the fridge and make it a dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and that meat be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
These crap that when something is cheap must certainly be wrong, spoiled or of poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth; -)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies distributed some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about god, I was confused, but I suspected it would be a kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found who released it and finally Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good matchos, full of completely useless lessons, as I have to be wrong and not to be a PiCUS.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to cut down.
I experienced something similar with a former girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with this person because you like him without realizing how much there is in the situation.
She threatened me several times due to the fact that I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
And also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she was terrified and begged me not to go anywhere on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then it took another six months and she was started to fight for a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship with telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch a amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously cutting down here by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positive ones that wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we do is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being put under house arrest for five days in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped with that cloud and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I'm looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, the MLM recruiting is again returning to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you may not be interested, especially among people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make people talk.
When the first money made came, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to pitch a few certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, or you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump to every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in one bag.
There are people who are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't experienced many such things in a company where I work.
HR is calm, managers look after their own management and don't poke our noses into anything.
So regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it works quite a bit for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll look at what worked out and what not) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that we are such a near-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't bother us very much as long as there are results.
The Czech Republic is missing in Britain after its death.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched without success for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that they were found dead by a woman from Uherskohradiště.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that she found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Considering the family, we will not disclose more information about the case.
Honest condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
They last saw a young woman on the bus on November 28 on her way from work, she should have collected money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol included her among the missing persons around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
In this context, the police arrested one man already a few days ago.
What role he should have played in the case and what she suspects him of, but she did not disclose.

The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03: 49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that here we have a quite dangerous contagious disease took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its strata is, I have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to him I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be rid of the position of president and the ability to acquire it again.
However, the chance that this really occurs is very small, as the others mentioned here.
Moreover, I am not sure if shredding the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is such an act that the president of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: There is increasing number of people under 35 who are without sex for a year
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex life increased from 8 to 21 percent.
There are more than ever women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in recent years.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has risen rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them said they had been without sex in recent years.
It was 29% for single people. Stone added that married under 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married people under the age of 35 is still falling.
Young people divided the opinion of premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's fine.
"It is true that they are a minority between singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving this trend," Stone says of these 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has risen from 20 to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who have been participating in religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less religious", the trend rose from 10 to 20%, "Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing this need".
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order for vaccination against covids is about whether the company should force a part of the population to behavior that they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
I.e., for example, the question of whether if we don't recommend it to them and they die will be our fault.
My argument is that we certainly could for the death of a 80-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, is talking about bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do so themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a pan-girls.
Once in the middle, the teacher led us across the city to the shipyard, so we can ride on boats along the river.
On the way there, we walked along one such rather wide street and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they met with us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we also asked her and the teacher what she was saying to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul, "she replied.
All, including a teacher, we laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
There is not much happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Matěusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is beneficial, using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group" bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor informed the chancellor of a situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record 100 attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He discussed other sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in a dispute with Belarus, and condemned Lukashenko's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunken Polish nuns blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was managed by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police told her that she could still lose a driver's license from the scene of the accident, she went out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came to their sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took her driver's license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing about it: The laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce Gump's cheesy film - a dog that taught people to live, another film Tady we are now looking after audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film Tady Hlídám ja from 2012.
A talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the boarding house in Šumava, who is dying, so dog handlers, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika, will start inviting him to it.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also a film producer) struggled with the storytelling process already in the previous dog film, but at least children and a dog had fun there.
This time, the creators of the pair wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child and if a proper "constellation" comes true, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, despite years of training), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite her own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which a family takes her to the hospital to the heart of the miraculous healing process.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content PelMel full of implausible situations and figures were needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog competition, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving at a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and immediately sits curled and pours with a cigar at the family table and demands father's whiskey and flambés as a cured vegetarian, it can't be laughed.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after the coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for characters' characters and points of view and directorial leadership.
The acting performance is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
However, Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they have nothing to play.
The only plus point of the film is the poetic footage of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshund.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, flimsy plot and dog talk, let alone the more popular profanity that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long-time membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of a person with a dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse exactly from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer if he is not, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such KIDy furt, you may change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in which case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"Such a complete absence of precipitation during November, as we saw at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
That's why the two-day rain this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
She didn't rain here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is abrupt and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
They dry out without them and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to three last rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water has warned against drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that precipitation here may decrease depending on global warming and climate change," predicted Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israel Water Management Authority in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tanker trucks on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to two previous years," tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has the driest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defense minister said that negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and that he informed Washington of preparations for attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians will play with them".
About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
Finally, I discovered that my suspicion of a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these fakes, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, plenty of snow and nice weather awaited them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas started operations thanks to that.
Skiers were also not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While the staff do not complain about the interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are happy, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the director of the Ještědáakub Hanuš Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná in Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today, an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not bear the praise of the representative of the ski center in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after experiencing covid-19 disease.
On the other hand, people are ready for it and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in recent years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of Snowbear Hradec Králové company, also feels that due to covid there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were already almost halfway through.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people got angry with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested have to order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest in a ski school is also comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich to not go abroad, it must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a doctor of specialists.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company will not just go abroad.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started in such a way that Orbán won one beautiful day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
Another question is elections at all.
If she lives crazy here, some traditional V4 maniac can also win here.
Its supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain young and educated.
Horrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood due to a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor published a photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srncová worked said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7: 45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
On December 3, one of their co-workers reported her disappearance.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petr, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who could have any information that could help it find to contact the police," the communication continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová also calls on the public to cooperate, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably settled to death," she said in Labor politician, holding a photo of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our healthcare," Harmanová said.
The police have previously arrested one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like this either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are revoking the threat of Invasion and began to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has GDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That's all, and that would correspond to the "concentration" at the borders.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables, mainly suburban connections, apply in Prague from Sunday
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) have been seeing several changes from Sunday, especially related to suburban connections.
New lines arose, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main railway station.
In the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station, the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will newly stop.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Starý Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Regions.
77 lines will be repealed, 37 new lines will be introduced and traffic will be adjusted on 12 working ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague – Královovice u Rakovníka was also created, replacing the canceled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will now depart.
Lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, is newly canceled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02: 30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended, following from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
Changes were made to the routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk and the routes of some buses to the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen region are modified.
A healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the power to exercise, I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at high speed I will buy pizza buns and a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it's the case.
And these are not trees that you must always see.
Only the tip of the trees can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why they ban us from riding off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confession of Dara about her relationship with Nedvěd: I didn't look forward to that at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, even because of the singer, the famous football player has been able to divorce.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to the fans in which she explains why she hid love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to her ears.
But he packed her, not the other way around.
They are the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If those who are not interested in it at all, it also makes it stand out from them from the can, or we, whose lives they hand over to each other in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match to each other, or if you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
After all, that's a joke, you want it, bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there again for a long time as the vice-chairman of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth only now that they were waiting to conclude Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are only three weeks in paper.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us for it.
We are only people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and as he stands by me, I stand by him. Rollins concluded in good and in bad, as he stands by me.
Hi, the other commenters probably have already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very long before, so you probably won't find it very well now, but look at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejlů, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and in this direction it's fine, in addition it's close to most of the faculties of BUT (I don't know where exactly you're going).
So I've never looked for a lease, but I'm a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
But that's an example of a completely "normal" thinking.
Due to what several doctors somewhere decided to do in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either whether they are learning what they want and paying for it from their own or whether they are traveling according to the state and paid by the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because a few crowns will happen to a full state contribution and thanks to that, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed this about a five-day action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a voice against anyone going to abortion is the same for you as a voice against a statue standing on the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing / digitizing that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it from the eye, or write something like xxx * * * or... (according to convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it seems that you are pulling it out of a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own mark, which sits on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian kingdom (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with "
Politicians do not even know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood any text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with that English, after the withdrawal of the GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I have been working there for the third year now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 a.m. and never a problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has almost never advanced there in his life.
Yes, probably most of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't have it: D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go to it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček was not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light up.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist Blesk, confirming Patrasová that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where it will be at Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together AGAIN!
But we still talked about something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dade and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I will always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luděk Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I know no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in the crisis.
There are few policemen and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of people with healthy training at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is up to the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies must be changed, the landscape should not just be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going to undergo the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture have also been recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also intensifies the effects.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, that's going to be the way I barely keep my skates on the ice, the mushrooms I know what it's like to play hockey and the tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total mess.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who are listening to what they notice, what the referees do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the opposite, it's just as always, and that the Czech Republic lost more often with Russia than it won, it would probably be classic "they lost" vs "MY we won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 100,000, 871 for 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, it is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, said on Sunday on TV by Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical order for the British Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects them to increase.
So far, no one died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labor leader Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is rising to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial ITV for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a vast majority two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing it from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because there were not even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of voter precincts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one is in such a way that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided precincts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a great increase for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even more hard in order to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
She recently leaked a recording of the chairman of the parliament and one of Fidesz leaders, László Kövér, to independent media, where he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my mother's parents didn't have much patience, I'm not too, the dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely extremely hard (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely now have a tendency to solve things with violence as a child I quite wanted, now I'm going to get into something at least and, as a younger parent, I have been slapping over my hand for example (so that I don't get much over my handle), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I am not able to determine the extent to which it is my explosiveness, but certainly the education has its share in it too.
I am also afraid that I will lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible to at least a little bit of a child seams, so I don't blame them for that.
It doesn't make me feel very vague, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call kundas those that the laws create in such a quality.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can people really count on the fact that they want and buy the product and you will have something to pay for the mortgage?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of four accused of murder by Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
She was mobilized by civil society, but she also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists can do great for this.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the opponents of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day ago, two later?
Whereupon, they let themselves be fooled and the company rejected it.
Czech TV was dying with ČOVID even half a year ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is over and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government over years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from law a more significant strengthening of their options when deciding on storage, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, is set by municipalities in particular: The proposed extent of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of decision-making on the selection of a location for storage, is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be really effective if municipalities or the public can affect whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The submitted draft substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not really have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for storage.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the office or minister whose interest is to issue an permission decides.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
Co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which rents external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with lawyer Jan Zemank.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who simply pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities to state authorities in the search of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, I expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
For support, we also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage alone.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear of losing weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyles for years, doctors finally warned him.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There is a completely different person from the fatty from the sitcom Roseanne!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body caused the furniture to creak.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in an interview for AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it were some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, formal text and, for example, university text, I would probably look for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses to everything.
For example, the game like Dark Souls, etc. has several bosses, that Yes, so there is "boss" something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where bosses are, but the player can't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's probably probably not even possible to translate boss in one word for that flat-rate, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (an interesting one is only Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for the story or game, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watching over the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also joined.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště has been looking for since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We will share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues fear her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her
MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czechia before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks significantly increased last month with the approaching end of the year.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice had an invoice, this time it was called Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021... exe, "said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively searches for saved credentials that it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity increases again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and in November security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still worth almost a fifth of all detection.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook most often contained the attachment of the file extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear as well.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
Security analysts for the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of the attack and in the Czech Republic have not had any major attack campaigns in recent months, record a significant decrease and decrease in activity.
Today's bunch of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and according to my experience of the demonstrators, I am not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People filled the embankment and the bridge in the procession and the opposite embankment road.
That means that people really do a lot.
A unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers themselves, anti-maskers and so on would not be able to fulfill or pay such a large procession.
The actions of the association wanted the dog are growing in popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy disturbed.
Sometimes I have such an impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or center-right movement, bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to revaccinate every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action of scientists, which humanity is really proud of.
At the end of the foot, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev instructed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement to assemble a new government from the November elections.
This has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April, when the government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests last year.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking at?
From the "secretly" footage taken, there is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain during the weekend about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived is calling for information about children's hospital employees.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srncová worked said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7: 45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
On December 3, one of their co-workers reported her disappearance.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petr, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who could have any information that could help it find to contact the police," the communication continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumper (and also regional pirate councillors), reported that she violates copyright with her paintings.
But the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumper's rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
Magistrates referred to the complaints about the ŘSD that the road belongs to, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
