The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should enclose the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs 179 €.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of credit?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help out, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it is OK for him, that's good.
You can best gauge yourself whether this fits for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
In purely legal terms, it's probably questionable.
Perhaps that is why the statement of the psychologist comes.
Because if something like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. should actually happen, it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot but the title partout doesn't occur to me anymore maybe someone knows about it here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his big cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who after a short investigation gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide before every suicide and to document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death on purpose)
This confronting fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
Have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, has splinters of wood under the thumb nail (outside) over the entire length.
Tried to pull him with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log on fully automatically to a suitable digital control centre.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable control panels.
Auxiliary registers exist for control panels that can program only the CVs of 1-255.
Engine oil users benefit from up to 28 speed steps with 255 addresses.
Three further engine oil addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking distances as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic commuter train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC traces.

Because of omicron: Johnson wants to push ahead with booster vaccination
Ever new omicron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
By New Year's Day, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on coronavirus booster shots in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers than previously targeted.
Every adult in England should already be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since vaccination was vaccinated, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One is facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccination dose.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. DPA

I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
* * I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
* * I am a foreigner and do not want to kick a civil servant over his feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Got a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today is not possible
Obviously, the chair had an unobservable defect in sales.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write a little bit of detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let us help or think we could not help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing distance, I can not reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What good is the series for "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Again, nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with the review of the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach."
However, this did not settle after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby even more than the naked result disappointed the manner of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma is representative: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) at a whopping 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and didn't implement what we trained."
Namely to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team itself the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15), the Giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points, having already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to squabble.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 spectators.
we used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally came forward six months ago.
Always as if peeled from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned for the Advent season must also be cancelled, as the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de) states.
From January, the artists then want to make up for their dates already moved in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone with its repertoire of hits and chansons has established itself in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and considered on etiquette, Max Raabe is an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the programme "Good day, good luck." DPA

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent price brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent level.
I will speak to the Minister for Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the US.
There could be more than 100 deaths in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes wreaked havoc in the United States and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long swath of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tornado raced through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she showcase #NAME# sold out.
That's a pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
by when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form or gave a return and wanted to ask if this arrived or is being processed, since I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees cash premiums for the vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company he was blaspheming about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.

Help with your first own campaign
Boron to greet you!
I am currently leading the adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought up and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble over my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to lurk at the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
In non-mercs, the goblins lurk at the heroes in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three arches each to the left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village Schulzen, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be unavoidable, this half-eleven intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The Goblin group will play a decisive role later on, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly heed many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
If you can then have the return receipts come, then I can pack the lamp and take it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to breathe a little with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 preliminary reporting on time.
Due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else has to limit itself, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race at the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, they both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen would be allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on the subject to Hamilton.
On Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew there was that possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally do not like with the artificial commentary style of Roos, but admit that this is a matter of taste.
But I seriously even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillings that make both simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment, which he obviously does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the phase-out round, Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not leave me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very meagre and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, apart from advertising, RTL is doing a better job in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the terrific F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me it will be sent out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will review and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on the 12.12.19.
One of them already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire plants can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (can be found in our shop) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to call.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an exhaust manifold or similar... and you can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards running the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even if we indicate here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is out of tune just because it once took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate the same bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
You like to scold about these services, of course, even if we say at the moment... they're having a hell of a hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Do you know how to order the legs in bright here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 flown into space as Nasa astronauts Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess son.
How much they each paid for their ticket did not tell Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his assignments and do everything himself.
She had just flown along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space right away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object slowed down by large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned all-out: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought at the time that I certainly want to and will study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially depressing the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What are you working as at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
At the moment, I am really unsure and am thinking about dropping out of my studies in 2022 and completing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have experiences there write them also like Mal:)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there's also the before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "driveway" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which had to be sent out before the driveway, order here order there, everything * necessarily * before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that's not allowed to be?
Or because people in all seriousness want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What is this self-hostage because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves to them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independently so on it.
My question is simple: Is this just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking cookies and tinkering with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts, I finally have to get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and the formation of new feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the plumage damage occurring in bird keeping is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately still not working
GDR handwork model Old E-locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal-fired trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have been refurbished
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG determined in March 1926 about the delivery as 1 "Co + Co1" locomotive with AEG bearing drive with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives took place, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The remanufacturing worthiness of all six locomotives was determined at the Reichsbahn improvement plant in Dessau.
[4] As the reelectrification of the Central German network progressed, an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service arose. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger quantities, were first of all preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable with the E 94 that the reprocessing number could not be further increased did the E 95 come into the focus of reprocessing.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
So it often happened that contactors remained stuck during switching actions.
Then the co-driver on this locomotive had to loosen the shooter again during the journey with a hammer and a wooden wedge.
Damage to the traction motors often occurred and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most splinter genera, so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which entered service on 5 October 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system on Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external remanufacturing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is supervised by the museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Hall P have been working on the operational remanufacturing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig to form the Central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Manual work model H0 in OVP, function good, visual rework on the locomotive in own work is necessary, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell!!!, very rare manual work model, very small editions - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam can not be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center beam does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get sent new ones.
When will they be sent?
no No flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the mold, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I have these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has arisen, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday, according to the data.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But then it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To quell fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur posted a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, "Şahin wrote in a post on the" LinkedIn "network on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumours."
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not be about himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling severe Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask about the reasons.
"However, the most common cause appears to be anxiety, which is frequently fuelled by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the verification vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the BioNTech boss has, according to his own information, been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities to go out of their lights on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale fault could finally be completely remedied late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts, "said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out around 19.15 o'clock on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10 .000 volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, complex cleaning and repair work is necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 o'clock more than 21.000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
Further 20.000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 21.30 o'clock.
Since 23.15 o'clock also those last affected by the failure would have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
Authorities had also called for neighbourhood help after setting up an emergency power supply for key buildings on Saturday lunchtime.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire brigade equipment houses if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the main focus was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?

I would be happy to receive feedback
yes this is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
Do you send me the return form by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E- #PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
Such a low credit I find almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that

To make the paint application uniform and clean, you should clean the components of dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping quickly back and forth with the brush.
This results in unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
True to the original appearance, the models achieve through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trim strips and license plates for car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when pasting time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the backing paper away sideways.
Caution: Always check first whether the image fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, crease or even tear.
Suction off excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place to where I have read.

Will I receive this via email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
ok nevertheless thank you very much!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But will I get that back without any problems?
Fertility treatment at PKV/What is an "insurance claim"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
In turn:
We had applied for the fertility course in advance at the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied to PKV for reimbursement of costs and were again granted 3 further trials.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more tests than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insurance claim.
According to the GTC, however, "The insured event begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the commitments that with one birth the further attempts lapse?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
OK.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I first have to send the thing back.
I can't help the fact that the dresser arrives completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It says clearly that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition for it with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
> A * * low-budget film * * or * * low-budget movie * * is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Yours sincerely
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position... I will soon give up again, because it just does not work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at high cost to EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus "border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
According to the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP), the EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way.
This state of limbo - Belarus does not concede very small, but the EU feels as a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a member state gets into its head to do its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to cross into Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, Border Patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as a leader in Minsk, of having lured it with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most impactful element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"That's where the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protest after controversial Formula One final
Max Verstappen allegedly committed two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Following Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula One final, Mercedes have appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to a supposed breach by Max Verstappen at the Red Bull in the final safety car stage when he is said to have overhauled irregularly.
A second objection was lodged against the standings at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had still overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I talk to the bank and report back to you
Thanks for the support

The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bits/31250 kHz and finally offers hi-fi quality on your system.
There is practically no difference to the original audible anymore.
A Class-D audio output stage with up to 3W output power drives the loudspeakers, which may have between 4 ohms and 32 ohms impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All individual noises can be individually adjusted in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid flow chart allows the model-accurate simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it to their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave that completely.
Yes wow then you are as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely solved.
Because of me, one God got the whole thing going.
But once you're creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just tapping nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and color errors into the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (See instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an antireflection coating.
While maintaining the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, although it took until you came to a person, you were great
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# Team,
I have already contacted you under the customer contact number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yeah, but it said before.
You can't deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many a curious situation when selling fir trees.
Once a man is said to have driven home even without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
That always makes the run-up to Christmas a bit funny, he says.
What about the voucher??
Otherwise I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate this accordingly!
We don't need to have any discussions here about the better dish, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning skewer.
And both therefore have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher," which sounds far from so delicious.
Problems with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems to build a stable Wifi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, at the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I move in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket, which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\ ~ 45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" via the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought, now would be quiet at the current accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has cut the allowance in half and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to EUR 50.000 for current and investment accounts and to EUR 25 .000 for overnight deposit accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers."
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin even got right against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly form provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table top for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people was delivered.
The underframe is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But her life resembles an uphill and downhill ride.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the Most Influential Woman of the Year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance is taken care of by a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to one chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly to her is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she is simply unlucky with happiness - and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby's wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang touch, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo after less than half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the premier motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and finished on the podium 103 times. DPA
Friedrich fetches 60. World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I have calculated this once, I would have to take nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, in which he went from third to first place.
Then he changed something about the material setting and drove out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds a bigger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
The Berchtesgaden driver Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after finishing second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte took her third victory of the season in the bobsleigh of two on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She posted her first podium finish this winter alongside her Olympic qualifier.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay, "said Burghardt and emphasized:" It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it. "
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said he had expired which annoys me very much.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare bench seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again as it is currently reduced:)
Why is shipping not started until 16.3?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was accepted by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the mis-delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it goes one - or another so...
I am 24, have kPTSD, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because Hand is in the dressing due to burning).
On top of that, it is chilled and we currently see each other less (1-2x week) which bothers me a lot with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework coming up to us, which we of course divide up.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and coping.
Not good, but I can cope and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental cues, because otherwise I'll pack the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can not do it...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would certainly find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you in any case still a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately all the other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12. #NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What then makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserve culture or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? Like to write in English that I also understand well
This has been a very long time, then I would refrain from
All right, thanks.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world anyway, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live for himself, I think.
I think the transition is also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that tells you anything, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one only slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Relax. Relax.
Such a child can stand much more than you think.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up from the stomach?
Or is it face first Directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We also all grew up and when my husband was born, it was eg gang and would be that you put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
Then why are you offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
But it is simply the case that the politics of this station are now under all sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One wanted to "not be a running Litfass column."
What are you now?
An 0815 commercial broadcaster trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a recall, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Broken body due to damaged delivery of the # PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for cuddling - My little warmth friend is versatile.
Cherry kernel cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and release it again in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or burn stains and dispose of immediately if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover beforehand to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (observe the information provided by the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but this disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (ignition and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 ° C) on your crook of the arm!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensation.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores emerge, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the device shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 ° C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after Hinserie - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table.
For Ingolstadt, it does not work under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top flight, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Vllt do you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 litres capacity also swallow larger photo equipments without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
A metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack is located in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stably riveted, in which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without latching the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the suitability of the backpack for everyday use enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and easily store both separately from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left backpack half and do not come in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if it is due to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# yesterday sent me an email confirming the assignment of the
Contact announced by the forwarding company for the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, with none I came further than the promise that I will receive an e-mail as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not have guessed and just could not redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread, triggering the so-called "California Gold Rush" of "49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your fellow pioneers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered at Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the roster where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a lock!
This deactivates one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the players have to defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up on my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
> The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! to go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the frame for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries deliberate on removal of testing requirement for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and from when the testing requirement can be dispensed with for three times vaccinated people," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers "Conference, told" Bild am Sonntag. "
Eliminating 2G plus for the triple-vaccinated is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers next Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I best proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error has occurred.
Purchasing via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called * awareness *, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often it comes to the hearing of sounds/voices, less often to the seeing of images and most rarely to the perception of pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since very deep anesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child up to the time of unbuttoning.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned at the anesthesia audition.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
* * EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but * * u/Nitemarex * * by definition had none.
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 € will not help us.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We're also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an e-mail that you have not answered.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the doorstep - because of # PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man is getting older."
The harrowing diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I already testify to my life's intention here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not collected
New York takes MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After losing 1-1 in regular time to host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in the penalty shootout 4-2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Roulades Tips & Tricks
I had received a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that:)
Now I have come to the taste and would like to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my # PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can do that
IEs is about a refund of € #NUMBER#
I have already been informed by e-mail on 18.01 that the refund has been made.
But to this day I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube output stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other hand.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT + series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up, it sounded already that you can even make a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the entire potential of the VT + series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or during direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot switch, you can also call up the sounds comfortably by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it in others like that.
Is it then possible to send the lamp back to you?
Since she hangs too low for over a dining table?
Well, I'd like to send them back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it does not work, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait has not been worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
Progress is emerging in negotiations to revive the international nuclear deal, according to Iranian figures.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that are supposed to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development," because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revitalize the agreement had continued after a one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only state to be above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day figure with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 received intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print that out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, isn't it?
here I do not have to click/specify/fill in anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at your own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes a cheekiness.
It's time for change
# # # MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: It is not extistent.
We got into a winter stare and extended the summer hole to a few months.
# What is the problem?
Yeah, what was the point?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has become increasingly apparent that many here are still really looking forward to the MBundestag.
# What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of fragments.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a disc server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that's not bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and the time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for this and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this as I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread # PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or to decide on the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently probably also eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that on her side resentment arose, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without which you would put it on it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be there because of a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date, please.
From 01.02. #NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the land
Recently, the Interior Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of 45,000 euros to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall for the new water rescue equipment trolley of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was €135,000.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this, "says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, increasing stakes are expected in the long term: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now hope for help.
Okay, so it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, ie we were also arms bearers in the executive, I do not want to go into this further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the public servant rather comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and weapon carrier people to the right of conservative magically attract should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality difficult is of course also clear, because you have of course next to the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (And by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché smugglings, because they exist in the executive rather less to nothing but quite normal men and women whom you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in case of doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds funny in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, that is to say they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if these politics supposedly stand up for them or think they have to do right, but they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they may openly say their opinion there or even openly make any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially policemen and soldiers who have often been abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
Also, it happens that certainly sometimes right-wing comrades meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very entangled internationally and that is also good so in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
it was confirmed to me but so in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More neat by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for some time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am independent, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stops, and every now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come spontaneously to visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time household just loses against work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it and this question has been on my mind for some time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and eg always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and squats)

Edges of inner sleeves notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wristband computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have loose conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has already become better).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I do not know if the concrete everyday work is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("again the simplest things are messed up") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("In the meantime, I should really know how to do this myself "/" I keep him from working with my stupid questions "/" He must really consider me to be inferior" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned at the point.
But you have already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean give back please!
If I downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with # PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The bird breaks down the protein absorbed with the food in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds from these in turn its body's own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of plumage.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A painted measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of new plumage formation is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is administered until the formation of new plumage is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15 ° and 25 ° C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So felling application made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that cutting down fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just crushing everything that can be crushed.
Before I pull this out... In short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - from you.
I'm doing the ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I do not give anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up teaching and I was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
At the times before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swing around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time the last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but since my weekend was also my weekend and my end of work my end of work.
That's when I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely closes - if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I'd like to have that the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here -, or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my free time, when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and together in a team what worked out and not as a lone fighter as this is the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I have not returned to the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of confused, but maybe as outsiders you have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation that I am completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20 + to the VT120 + with two speakers, the new VT + Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists in search of maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a rich sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt address.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT + amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite scoring 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-foreign things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused major damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, at 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, "Island Council President Mariano Hernández Zapata told state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 apartment buildings and other structures, according to RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a combined size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
Above all, the banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples," escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gifts.
Previously, gifts were presented to each other on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to save them another life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving emerged the custom, popular in Germany, of filling the boots, especially of children, with gifts.
Protestants clashed with this custom because they reject mediators between God and men as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only angers the fewest that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the use of Martin with Martinssingen and Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches, you can find everything your heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful cuddle about the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police Shoot Suspected Bank Robber Near Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man allegedly walking into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officers a little later, according to authorities.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color inside.
Quite harmless, on the other hand, is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither supply line nor batteries.
Place the "Light Stone" in any place illuminated by the sun on the day.
Two supplied ground skewers provide a firm hold if required.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar panel conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; in which color, that's up to you: In addition to daylight white, there are six attractive light colors to choose from.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this several times, it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear woman people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year of reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and fucking PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples on my last roughly two-year break from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but I was quite burdened and I did not feel comfortable.
In the two-year hiatus, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without thunder is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Gynecologist has unfortunately not taken me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone: n who has read through the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär bad atopic dermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale nodule lichen and the acne theme.
I also have nutrition in the course of chr. Illness tried everything possible and I got stuck on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because otherwise nothing worked really well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you have like me everywhere construction site you just prefer not to go looking for what else is wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague semina or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
In between I always have to work and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...

110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The planning approval decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the grid operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I currently still have big problems to plan my lessons in geography time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped at all, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me, every hour actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for divisions, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe an geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
Retailers fear Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered will be allowed into most shops.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments sales slumps.
He also has a possible solution at hand.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth criticized the decline in sales of non-daily items.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's only going well in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, the chief executive said.
"2G in shopping doesn't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
The ribbon scheme must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the ribbon received that day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business, "CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed." DPA
I recently ordered and received delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a flaw, which was tried with a yellow filler to be concealed.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and pasted it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The colour temperature and brightness of the lamp are set by a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in places that are difficult to access.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to carry out the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, one of the memory keys is occupied and finished simply by pressing it for a longer time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again the known situation is present again - Very convenient for studio work if eg. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is also installed - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of fixtures on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that the scope of delivery also includes a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy without problems.
Too bad I got it as a present and it is too small: (
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in series victorious Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SBU turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration about a mixed start to the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It is madness, what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and pronounced a "blanket praise, to every single one who was there."
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurt team, who are now in ninth place and still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had taken the Leverkusen 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SBU coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of play and his overcome muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," the 27-year-old said, looking forward to the result in particular for viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December that all the players are physically in a top condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and "carry through the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky) on the program.
I just get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would mean for me then unfortunately that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women ahead of quarter-final against Spain
Germany's handball women crept off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and their eyes empty.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection conceded a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game by everyone that we have to erase, "captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday to keep alive the tender dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defence," acknowledged backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed with the kick-off.
Miscues and technical errors in attack and gaps in defence were responsible for a quick 0-4 loss after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored their first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-kick.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial ignition.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she can participate again.
It was only in the closing stages of the first half that the DHB selection came into play a little better and at least five goals by the break.
The already only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-laid opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer rise to an increase in performance and went off the floor as a clear loser.

The title specifies that I work as a vaccinologist in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these are soon finished to a large extent, it continues afterwards in part in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, this is compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the information for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but they cannot (may?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations there myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" (We in Bavaria) provided for vigorous reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, this time the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unperturbed by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also no one "to whom everything must go quickly."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," viewers learned, "is a rag someone uses to wipe out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern."
This closed an educational gap - probably also among many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in 2 weeks.
The following error message always appears after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# gel #PRS_ORG# n, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for the road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove off with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tyre did not want to take part in the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again with a reasonably bad mood and take home the first track.
Was then also not quite so bad in terms of whimsy, maybe it is better if I practice again before the bike tour with the tire change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would get this problem more often than not.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires of the previous owner (very nice old man, has the day I came to pick up the bike until 14 o'clock 120 km demolished!) and who had already called them suboptimal, because he has driven with them for several years on a roll.
But when I think about it that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I am really in a bad mood: D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; These are supposed to be unflattenable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend now 40 €/tire, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore I ask myself: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
Although there are also (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use other tyres on a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Amateur knowledge rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car slams against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a central island and then got on the opposite lane, as the police announced.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old, as well as his 23-year-old passenger, were seriously injured in the crash and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but sonically an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably grown-up and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in treble.
This is generally customary in the case of broadband in order to optimize the bundling which increases excessively at high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that looks for its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adapted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all plates have been cut to size (e.g. in the DIY store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45 ° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer."
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example if you want to use finished strips from the DIY store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, ie the two sides, as well as the front.
The fitting of the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as of the connecting terminal on the rear wall is facilitated by means of a suitable perforated circular saw or a Forstner drill.
Then you use a round milling cutter to round off all edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the base plate can also be rounded with it.
The base plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming/blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
You push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot up to the terminal opening and let it protrude there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions for Crossover Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and only have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For well-known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people by Switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - yet we'll give everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get some drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
