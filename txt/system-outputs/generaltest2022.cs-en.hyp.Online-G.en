The big comeback of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the match with Vegas, he alternated and from this time on the ice rinks of the NHL has not yet presented himself.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver-based fullback announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning us time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of his shots.
The Plzeň hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his senior year, he had hip problems and in the shortened pandemic year, he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Francik" caught 36 games, his success rate of interventions is at number 92.3 %.
Charles puts on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate as this year's Christmas card chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille at the races helps to put on a veil.
On its website, this was reported by the British news station BBC.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and the foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a T-shirt with a collar.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, it is not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the races at Ascot.
Charles, who has a top hat on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil in color matched with a bright dress.
Slavia by efotbal.cz she promised Berber a million for the title, the hard man denied it.
Prague-criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former deputy chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman berbr was supposed to have promised Slavia Prague one million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
It was reported by the server efotbal.cz with the fact that he got to a part of the police files.
Jaroslav tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the vršovický club, said that the red and whites had not committed any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly figures its former sports director Jan nezamar, who last summer in the Championship club finished.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red-whites was in frequent contact with both berb and the former sports director of the then second-league Vysehrad Roman rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The criminalists allegedly worked with information that Slavia berbrov promised a financial reward for this when she received the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors slavie Tvrdik.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, did not seek to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard, " Tvrdík said for the news list.
Among other things, Nejmar indiscriminately insults some former players of dark-skinned Slavia and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
In mid-October last year, the case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by a police crackdown on several places, including the FAČR Prague headquarters.
The highest ranking in the affair is berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPS are LARPing the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen have to take out of the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars-Toyotas hi-lux-are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles-at a decent level, in addition, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga v3s even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport-too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones-few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
Air defense: medium-cold war, obsolete; short-range-good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I got a chase right outside of town.
Nutria were coming out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat down and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course the fox came in a minute.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, he was waving his headboard all over the place, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got out of my seat, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive stuff in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Homeland got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The irozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for a respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka kabrhelová speaks with Dominika kubištová, editor of the irozhlas server.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the numbers that the older generations have suffered), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that could be seized by trained people, we do not actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where who can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced need to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will be conducted only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
especially we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there are such situations that you watch a dude who missed an empty gate two minutes ago, go on the attack alone among 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they'll take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill" get a defender " is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect any major reversal for the coming weeks.
The onslaught in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As it was said, the first to get to the domestic patients is Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, eastern Europeans, and especially Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak has grown".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the west, they tell you how they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
They're afraid to cancel culture, to say this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where what is, so all objects are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of deployment of warheads due to the westernmost position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Apart from the museum's maple, the rest are in a state of disrepair.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was absent a little, he went regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He went to school in the countryside, did various monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, they threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on the ad (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I sold often to gypsies, they always had money, they did not try any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later and said he had already overwritten it..
I myself say that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves the way he belongs in a decent society (works, works, does not beat women, just normal behavior).
But as soon as someone comes, he reaches out, eviscerates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble.. well, I don't care what color it is, but I don't mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash on Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemia ambulance service, told pravu.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of bavorov and, for reasons not yet established, he turned into the opposite direction.
Štěpánka schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident after the collision with the ŠKODA Octavia.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute prehospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in české Budějovice, said paramedic fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš neuheisl also orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector says.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and send the post office data for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officers expect the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader already at the time of sale, it will be charged by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for transportation.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of incoming shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to the Czech post, the problem is that people do not respond to requests to supply the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about half here, says Matyáš vitik, a spokesman for the Czech post.
Dealing with inflation
See headline, How would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get maybe added (who is the employee)?
They added 2% gross to me this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven rapists are sent to prison for only six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his / her victim will have a trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Doesn't this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from kostomlat, on which an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her.
He took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency number and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made up everything so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Czech police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the PCR.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally am of the opinion that the Slavs have long been ethnically and culturally we are not, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which God or gods should man choose?
I would say that it is quite probable that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one God who will severely punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it is said that there is no god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed would send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Other: voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, x months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All branches of the ACR could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of defense.
We can say this: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of blending taking place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that there will never again be a Russian, a German or, for example, a Mongolian Raider.
​I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Well, bless you.
Just one U.S. election that screws up their budget, and NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the poles have already shown once that they just need to show their back and take what they want.
The only thing that functions as a guarantor of independence for a long time is a heavily armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today can pilot a remote-controlled means of any teenager, so what would it not work.
We don't need a border wall, that sucks today, but a pimply teenager behind a remote control device can handle it.
How not to drown in a boxed tsunami
You unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is swamped with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can, by Agreement, bring to the involved store (project map KAMsNIM.cz there are almost 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid cluttered blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, since packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One of such stores is also Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to us by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
Application www.KAMsNIM.cz however, it shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, swaps and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukličme česko association.
Rather, it seems wrong to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throws everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend-it starts in January-and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans-at work, on the streets-and mentioned so many events that they could not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, split between the right and the left, agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe", and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticise Macron for being pro-European and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened Cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the first rungs of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu / being stung" for a few days I had diarrhea and didn't really feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

Trains begin to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains begin to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time, or even slightly their route, is adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
With the sale of tickets began carriers already during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic routes, the new timetable will also cover Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be Interjet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be launched by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem-mělník-Nymburk-Kolín.
The carrier will replace české dráhy after success in the competition of the Ministry of transport.
RegioJet will run a total of 16 routes daily, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův brod, ž .ár nad sázavou and Kolín stations.
LEO Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil sedlařík, despite the planned lockout works, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar running times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva Trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in, for example, Českolipsko, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav through česká lípa to rumburk, Trilex trains of the German company die länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, die.
I've never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in the schools that black people were often sold into slavery by black people themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern one.
I have not met with the fact that someone deliberately concealed the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in one's feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they had some of their good successes, and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people nowadays idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the south was a slave owner, and a lot of things went against them, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view does not exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT, where they turned off someone who started talking about our Legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny in U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was terrible at some universities, the students were radicalized enough, and the schools encouraged them to do so many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I'm a little sick of the idea that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At the moment, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also did not encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole useless from the point of view of any personal identity.
If anything connects me with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is such a nice guy, he preaches more theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some coronavirus shit that makes everyone feel ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite church.
Officially Moderna are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services with the Hussites, because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on botanická street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they celebrate Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Plamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took him from Austria
Breclav-the flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the reintal – Breclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we take part in every year with the section, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me that I was chosen, Scout amálie budíková told the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the reintal – Breclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually scouts go by train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes about the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch cikrle.
About the subsequent delivery of light on Saturday 18. December will be taken care of by Scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, of course, to wear veils, try to observe the spacing, there were as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way as to be as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem light event, Zuzana hrbková.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem, which wanders through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its distribution for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the basics of economics that say subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will properly use this money, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned-a useless product is produced and it breaks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million “XY funded/co-funded by project XY” signs in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not a promotion of a company that gives work to x people, this is a hindrance to development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap-especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads do not move with me, but then I find that they also influenced me - it's just so sophisticated that one can not always avoid it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who now want a total ban on programme-driven (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics-I would have banned the internet.
I have a feeling that this virus is rooted in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original point of view, which I'm going to say is critical thinking"
2. "I'm not gonna believe everything the media says."
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV fell in the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of them this year have two hundred
Los Angeles-movie theaters, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies and will premiere a record-breaking two hundred this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDB.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years is scoring among the audience and significantly increasing the ratings, therefore these pictures are being created more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those pictures that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will be a lot more holiday films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, there are also popular pictures at home alone, love in heaven or the classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures started only in 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable television station Hallmark, recalled the BBC server.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas (countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its viewers for Christmas already 22. October and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
The rival station lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll be home for Christmas movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark television uses the same formula for its films, which, although uniform, is successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, gray adds.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home they never wore sweaters very much," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work in six months.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
Silver stars then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but Silk will give the sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
To date, the most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720 000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Sappers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.

Health and Human Services is looking into another case of a child from Adam's.
"Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from adamovo, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov elementary school is not proven,“ said ciupek.
There were six cases in the county in a week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the national reference laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the state Institute of health in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from the same department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and adamovo.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who was abroad.
The association with the championship in water polo is not in any of the Listed, said ciupek.

California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous US state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a ruling Friday by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld Texas ' ban on abortion, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that set the right to abortion across the U.S. at roughly 24. months of pregnancy.
However, the court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban in this case was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand damages of at least $ 10,000 (over $ 220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, components for "Ghost weapons" or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of Supreme Court liberal Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity from judicial review to the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like, and also there is an improvement in the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that yet.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine should come on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater efficiency.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against the law if it used its new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw € 36 billion from the EU fund to rebuild the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified in view of the fact that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure jeopardize its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building"impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under Democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
But to understand it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I also met one yogurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an eviction, I will not even smell in any market, no action, golden shop on the square, maybe they do not have such a choice, but usually they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more out of touch than most vaccine supporters.
Although rational discussion is taking place at the expert level, only extreme opinions are being brought into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Color cakes instead of robust analyzes.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states no one solves.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never because of grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to bed, fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "catch" the stove only brought and put so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to obey, I received a couple of blows to the ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and measure) is beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether to disobey and get it or get better and there will be no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System defense
In 1999, when Vojtěch CEPL, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, was answering a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him – whether it was a sacred document to which he swears and which he has been learning since childhood in school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch CEPL voted the question.
Recently, however, among lawyers, the opinion that the constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is increasingly emerging.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch CEPL belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But CEPL was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution, among other things, is a kind of order of government, consisting of individual rules that set out the politicians of the game.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fighting for the life of a multi-month baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the clinic of pediatric anesthesiology and resuscitation at the faculty hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told the newspaper.
The course is much simpler, easier, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period, " Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
The latter takes place in the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were on the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid-19 pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay on the resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease strikes next to adults both adolescents and several-month-old babies.
In hospitals, even children in severe condition due to coronavirus are found.
"At the moment we have a child of several months and adolescent age," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the children's hospital FN Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, there were 6. December to the death of six children aged 0 to 14 years.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department-he is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, so in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is recommended even in children," the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They are visible on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much outside the national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
Music plays in my head, Josef kurfírt laughs.
He was nursed by the Liberec opera and originally played the horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically the entire repertoire, and as a conductor he works not only in the F. šalda theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef kajetán tyl theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic Orchestra, the film philharmonic orchestra or the podkrkonoše symphony orchestra.
China gives the impression that the disease has been contained and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist jirouš: China gives the impression of having managed the disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was facing criticism for failing to stop an outbreak that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavirus, for example, even in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do not you want an elephant?
I got him, and he's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, the car washes the trunk, the children play with it.
Oh, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
All right, high-five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is broken, there's giant shit everywhere, the car is broken, the kids are fighting, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says, " you talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."..
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works towards its integration.
The latter works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different, and it will be successful.
I thought of that, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units on the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for 'Spanish fruit and tangerines' it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, I'm just saying: D
Be that as it may, This is a senseless request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey Kosman Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her from breeding animals for Life, reported The Sun newspaper.
Monkey rehabilitation specialists who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff of Monkey World in Dorset and now she is again happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent magistrates ' court, she was given a 12-week suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The head of the small monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further.“
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent Police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid at her flat over drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing profanely.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, " Do you want cocaine?“
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the calculation of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts you learn from that prehistory three times in a row, when you bravely skip the whole 20. century?
Like you're going to carry the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor to the exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
Just write a 1 test and then nobody cares.
Go out on the street and ask random people if they can figure out the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the vast majority won't even take a bite and tell you they don't give a shit.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is that people do not want and do not need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's kind of a learning curve for a lot of people who are going to need this thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all this to stand at the machine, I meant it... ...because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
However, the price of barbarians standing in front of these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, covid here probably never reached this size.
Wedding at first sight: the war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can not leave Switzerland right away, " Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Things between Kadri and Andrea have been rocky since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he was upset with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife did not like even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally comment on things like that, and even in my family, we never really said those things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to the words of Andrea.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
After that, he did not think of anything better than to climb to 5. floor and open the window to climb into the apartment.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently detained cchaa.
The man confessed that on the incriminated day he drank some alcohol.
And since he needed money, in his drunkenness he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to 5. the floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and is tied in effect to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Isn't that enough of a reason?
The right to assemble shall be limited, but not abolished.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of Science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like that 30-year-old
Tl; dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell headfirst from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, which was interfered with by the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Employees of the regional operations center received an hour after midnight Saturday emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews of zzs-medical and medical-immediately went to the place.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vitkovice caught coal.
But not as it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance vehicle transported him to the further care of the Ostrava trauma center, said Lukáš Humpl, a spokesman for the zzs Ms region.
I am more concerned than I am about the coronavirus because of the inadequate response of the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical personnel are the first line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Cutter.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
The underdog Julianna Peña was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a slayer.
Charles Oliveira in the light heavyweight did not hesitate, demonstrated against Dustin Poirier a great choke and defended the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt by technical KO in the first round.
His opponent was also defeated by Sean O'malley.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought by the women's bantamweight bout between the notorious Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes did not lose for seven years and sharpened her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, penova did not force herself to make any more mistakes and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with the help of a lever on her arm.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and knock it off.
Thus, the American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, although Poirier did better, the card gradually began to turn around.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to tap the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'malley scored a masterful victory, having already put a hard right back on raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he conquered it with a series of precisely aimed blows, scoring the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in English express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is a masculine gender, feminine gender or middle gender.
But then there is also a fairly large group of nouns, in which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unstressed form.
For example, the words" swivel "or" hip "are both masculine and feminine, in the first they are pronounced according to the pattern" machine", in the second according to the pattern"song".
For another group of nouns, different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example:" row/row"," kohlrabi/kohlrabi " or "potato / potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally unstressed, but gradually they take over Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender unmoved, but in the masculine gender it has endings along the lines of "Castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Three months we did not see the blue sky and choked, describes a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been battling for four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities there and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could prime minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to shut it down.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how these people are often treated by their neighborhood or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It's become a trend for victims to finally open up about their trauma.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic flooded houses under construction, families do not have money to finish
Prices for building materials in recent weeks and months have risen by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people have gotten into a sticky situation because of this.
It does not have the means to complete the houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage lending, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move to unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent, " says BHS economist Štěpán křeček.
We build two or three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them happen to us.
For us as a construction company it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contracted, even if the material has risen in price.
So we do without earnings, " said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait, " added slivoň.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
More favorable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said hamster.
We're having a good time, and we're gonna have a better time.
But real visions are missing, says commentator ČRO-mujrozlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to the classic celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
Apart from the prime minister and ano President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the chamber of deputies spoke to the nation this year.
What did we learn?
I have my own topic, which I have chosen, I follow up on the Bachelor, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I will write a written part.
Stateswomen are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something is left in his head, then this commission will not unnecessarily choke him on theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the State University and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which immediately came to me and I had it right.
Other than those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the course there is an exam, which reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't block e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Winnie the Pooh statue.
You still have to get her to touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that insta throws sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a bare minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been bugging me a lot lately, so I might have to go down to TikTok, where a lot of the artists in my line of work are very successful, and they don't give a damn about it.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Workers ' Party of Donbass
The union-yes, the break-up-no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza forest 8. December 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of 17. March 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that " the union of SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they" abolished " a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Bialowieza forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, inhibited agriculture, broke away from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post – Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria-all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a"vacuum of power".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the understanding that I'll put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday-describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to 69 CZK / kg - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself-nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Brno on hlavas and in the underpass of the ladies handed out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigade, they can not throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agita.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's too bad the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or if I wanted to leave her apartment early, she would cry and beg me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year but then another six months passed and she started to go crazy.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down so she doesn't get any amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are rampaging around buying a cloud of tests and rushing to positive, who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is making it difficult for companies, carriers, and others to have their employees put under five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped this antics and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, war is new, and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing hazing.
I see the good old bastard's coming back.
After several years of oppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at the university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't care, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk.
When the first money earned came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to rustle up several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made one feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump right on every speck and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or " fat " account.
I haven't seen much of that in the corporation I work for.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management and do not stick their nose into anything.
Regular evaluation is therefore somehow happening, in the form in which it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set yourself some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also within our company a little unique-there are departments what are more "corporate".
Sometimes one gets the feeling that we are such an almost-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so we don't bother much as long as the results are there.

The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the chamber of deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put more demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva krumpová, 1. vice-president of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday 12. December at 03: 49 hours.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the state election commission and, after approval, will be published in the collection of laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population in all its strata, I have a problem with this until now.
On vaccinations (tomorrow!) I'm most excited because thanks to him, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not jerks.
He would be deprived of the office of President and the capacity to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are, as others here have mentioned, very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure shredding a file could even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: the number of people under 35 who are without sex for a whole year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based People, reports the website of the daily dailymail.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women aged between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year is higher than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for family studies (ifs) showed.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who report not having had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said ifs researcher Lyman Stone.
Among people in marriage, sexual activity is more common, for 2021, only 5% of them said that they had been without sex for the past year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among the "less religious", the trend has risen from 10 to 20%, " stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole issue of covid-19 is whether society should force a part of the population to behave in ways that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question, on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
I. E.for example, the question of whether if we do not order them and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated, and he ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the CPC, is saying something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski area operators can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country skiing jizera fifty.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about the Lord's prayer.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we went down one of these rather wide streets, and we don't see anyone in the middle-the followers of the hare krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul, " she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, new German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly show that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be solved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy group, which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to dpa, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her license for not giving priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked her for help.
Then the police came for sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test, and after they found she had more than two pints in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does his best.
But Juraj šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked in American stories about dog lovers.
But in doing so, they forgot the essential thing: the regularities of the film craft.
After the cheesy film by F. brabce Gump - the dog who taught people to live, another film is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one person Juraj šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film here I watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, and so they begin to invite dog handlers, Julia's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julia, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and if the correct "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined-on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the she is taken to the hospital by her family so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what content pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A couple of shoplifters from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen coming to the den in search of "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the guest house will, of course, get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slacking as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
In addition, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters of the characters and the point and directorial guidance.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is muddy.
However much Lukáš vaculík, Jitka ježková or Nela boudová try to settle their party, they do not have much to play for.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the bohemian nature of the cameraman Vladimir holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long membership in the club of dachshund breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur-conceived stunt would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant abuse from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how much shit you understand, but that's only because you've never tried.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have noted at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought long ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israeli water authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are more tank cars.
Water lines and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, staying in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and world powers " understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About three years ago, this happened to me.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wants from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I gave the lady a little more doubts and questions, and finally thanked and left.
You can call me a scumbag, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers on the weekend went to the mountains, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves at the lifts covid certificate.
While skiers do not complain about customers ' lack of interest, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to cross-country trails and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanuš praised the interest.
Hundreds of people set off for the first weekend skiing in the new season also in jeseníky.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in branná in šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfekt, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period after having contracted covid-19.
Except for exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René hroneš from the Skicentre špindlerův mlýn told CTK.
"We recorded only units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra bokišová from the Opava shop skiopava.
A greater onslaught is expected in the period of ski courses.
David šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that covid-19 is not as interested in renting ski equipment as it used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, šinták told CTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, rental in the novako na Bozi Dar area is in great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the complex pavlína nováková.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here, like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Abroad, smart and clever people leave, who have no property here.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
With the rest, however, absolutely agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one fine day Orbán won, he ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a couple of tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the elections at all.
If it's a bad place to live, some traditional v4 freak can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can not be put on a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand The Crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor on social networks posted a bloody photo of his face.
Is this a real wound, or is this a trial for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srnc worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
Missing Czech woman according to her on Sunday 28. November around 19: 45 left work and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by 3. December someone from her associates.
Srncova, according to British media, worked as a" nurse's assistant "at the Evelina London children's hospital, which belongs to the hospital association guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
The public is also being urged to cooperate by Harriet Harman MP, who on Saturday drew attention to Srnc's case at a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC News website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (IE CA 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine in this way either.
These are not "huge amounts", but CA 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what makes you think Russia wants a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out on so many points that I do not even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the" concentration " at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague from Sunday new timetables apply, mainly suburban connections will be affected
Passengers in the Prague integrated transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which relate mainly to suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, Express trains from české Budějovice stop at the station zahradní Město.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to český brod.
The R17 express train from české Budějovice and benešov will stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
PID will spread to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to světlá nad sázavou, blatna u Jesenice, staré splavy and turnov.
Buses to Mladá Boleslav will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
With the integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation will be adjusted to 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague zličín, which will go as far as žatka.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and kralovice u rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
Connections from Prague to Rakovnik will be strengthened during the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line number 404 will start.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.

Additional line 410 goes through mělník and dubou to doks, mimona and jablonné in podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on ten local Central Bohemian lines, including to mochov, dobříš and rožmitál pod třemšín, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02: 30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long – term restrictions continue on the lines Prague-Beroun, Prague-lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Cologne.

The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and hořovicka in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a break of 30 minutes and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as much as possible healthy and dietetic.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy a maximum of pizza buns and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so, unfortunately, it is.
And it's not about trees, which you must necessarily see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're banning us from off-piste skiing, but it's one of them.
Confessions of Dara about the relationship with the bear: I did not look forward to this at all
Czech showbiz pond from Friday does not live by anything other than revealing the relationship of Dara rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been dating since the summer, the famous football player even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a lengthy message explaining why she hid her love from them for a long six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, Sorry, Not a bear," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She said he was the one who hit on her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both did not look forward to, but we knew that it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care at all and it pops out of the can, or us whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if any of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend fit together, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
I mean, that's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
There, in turn, Nedvěd serves for a long time as vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the finalization of Nedved's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us this, thank you.
We, too, are only human, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him.for better or for worse, concluded Rolins.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems to me like the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like vranovská, francúrská, etc., this is a pretty bad address), even some parts of židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the District of Veveří is very student, královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it is close to most of the faculties of but (I do not know where exactly you start).
I have never rented, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still have some information missing :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket or they go by the state and the state pays for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against having a statue in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging / digitizing that (even longtime professionals) either somehow throw it by eye, or write something in the manner of XXX *** or ... (by convention) and make a note that it is illegible.
The truth is, it's pretty legible in this case, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: isn't it more of a Odryská empire (kingdom) than odrynská?
PSS: someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is a smile.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for this anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing high-standard relationships.
Besides, it's quite interesting with English, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get the hate on cejl.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't have to :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, then I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix slováček (78) without Dada and mistress gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle at the advent wreath, Felix slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I have seen the lady's wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to blesko, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house on the vineyards, where Dada after his departure was left alone.
Slováček still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with anička, Felix and both grandsons.
Video: Felix slováček and Lucie gelemová: together again!
Felix slováček and Lucie gelemová: together again!
But we kept talking, so it wasn't Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to have fun, says slováček, who was happy to meet Lu .ko Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other force that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
The police are few and can not afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level is not.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape does not have to be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, less rainfall is recorded even in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage our land also amplifies the impact.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it will be so, I can barely keep in skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey and this tactic (what I tried in the Franchise Hockey manager) is also a total fool.
And whether you're a hockey team" Medvedev Russia "or" Lama China " so to lose by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is leveled.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who prick, what the judges notice do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it is probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And IMHO if it were the other way around, it is as always another time, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: the number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
Saturday 11. the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections in December.
5766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100 000, 871 per 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since 13. October.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, this is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing the "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the British health security authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died on Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister argued that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees in Downing Street, gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is growing to remove Johnson from the prime minister's post.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes constituency boundaries to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is so that everyone can in practice vote where he wants.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from the constituencies decided to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not if Fidesz would win, but how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will not in an effort to keep the power play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, president of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, in which he tells secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, parents mom does not have much patience, I do not either, dad has it for a long time, but then it blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a little terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they no longer knew.
I have a tendency to deal with things by force, I used to fight quite a bit when I was little, now I hit something for discharge, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the arm (so I don't get too much in the face), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I can't tell the extent of my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer" educational, " but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks up something, it is probably impossible not to at least slightly prznit their children, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the op should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws in this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a power outage?
Can you really count on the fact that people want the product and buy it, and you will have something to pay the mortgage on?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is all the fault of the press.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counterpetition of the deans of all medical schools, which came out a day or two later?
No, let the fool and the company, it hopped off.
On Czech television, they were dying of covid six months ago.
The next government ends, and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of prime minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the government interrupted the consideration of the draft submitted to the government by the Ministry of industry and trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities united in the platform against deep-sea storage, but also with the union of cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options in deciding on the repository, which is promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from the minister Karel Havlíček, which the platform has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities in particular: the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the choice of a site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the management of storage sites to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a project almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permit procedures.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities, realistically, according to today's legal norms, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their observations or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of exploration or construction work.
The Codecision of Municipalities called for by the platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s. r. o., concluded by the SÚRAO and following on from the contract with lawyer Jan zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is expected to be almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from hrádek and spokesman for the platform against deep-sea disposal, said: after the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments in the search for deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the union of cities and municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a major construction project in the same way as the directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep underground storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep underground storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for potential storage is subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: he lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body made furniture crack.
"I shoved everything in my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can no longer afford to sit still, said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If this is some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was a formal text or a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain boss.
To all this, there are more kinds of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc.has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the Lord / Ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all needed to defeat in order for the game or level to be completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like half-life, where bosses are, but the player does not directly deal with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
Well, then there are the mini-bosses.
It is a simple monosyllable to somehow translate boss just can not, Czech and other languages it somehow does not solve (interesting is only Catalan, which translates boss as the final opponent).
It is, in short, for a story or game in general, a significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra srncová since 3. December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She's been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since 7. December.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28. November.
British police have been looking for her since 3: 00. December.
Because of her, Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina rendlová confirmed.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman, a Labour MP, was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by a Tesla agent.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
A large campaign in connection with the Tesla agent we have seen 18. November.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is supposed to arouse the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as a copy of the 11,2021 receipt corrections...exe, " said Martin jirkal of ESET.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, for example, email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it subsequently sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the invaders is growing again.
In November, spyware formbook also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November intercepted rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands behind almost a fifth of all detections.
Attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3 days., 10. and 15. November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an extension .exe, which bore the name request for specification.
However, the name účenka also continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and dampening of activity is registered by security analysts with the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
The demos of today's smart guys who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Judging by the footage of the parade along the embankment and from my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of about 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment, as well as the bridge and the opposite embankment communication.
That is means people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek mokrý.
That the constant discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only the antivaxers themselves, the antirouškáři and co. they couldn't fill or pay for a parade this big.
The actions of the Dead Dog Association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is difficult to say what movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-and multi-dose one.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or a centre-right movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, since it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action of scientists, to which humanity is rightfully proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has instructed the formation of a new government Kirill Petkov from the anti-corruption movement we continue to change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the last government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From the "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, fears grew over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, for whom the London police have been searching for several days.
Petra srncová was last seen two weeks ago on her way home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived also calls for information about the worker of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srnc worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
Missing Czech woman according to her on Sunday 28. November around 19: 45 left work and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by 3. December someone from her associates.
Srncova, according to British media, worked as a" nurse's assistant "at the Evelina London children's hospital, which belongs to the hospital association guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeněk dvořáková kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in šumperk (and also a regional pirate councilor), was given an anonymous notice that he was infringing copyright with his paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of krteček in šumperské pokočíky do not violate the law.
In the mouth above the Elbe, the moon saw a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a hatch.
It was a matter of life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it allegedly did not respond, the hole went green.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "deal with the situation intensively".
