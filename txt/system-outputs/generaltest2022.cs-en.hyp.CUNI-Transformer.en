The big return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old fullback will be on the bench and could be in goal soon.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
In the middle of the game, he played with Vegas and has not played on an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred while the veteran goalkeeper was moving from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury,” the Denver unit announced in early October.
His return to the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was summoned from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
An inmate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had a hip problem in his senior year and didn't catch a single game in his shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, Francik made 36 catches, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photograph of himself helping his wife Camille to put on her mask at the races.
This was reported on the BBC's website.
They send their wishes to the friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte is dressed in it.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas card on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches the color of her pale dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accusation that the former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He told efotbal.cz that he had access to some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the reds and whites had not committed any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of police intercepts in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, features mainly.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then minor league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics reportedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbro a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to be promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to forensics, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Hardman has denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the intercepts, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's former dark-skinned players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR, in mid-October last year.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvps are Cold War larping.
The guns would be new, but essentially of a worse type (artillerymen had to carry cartridges by hand without cover from the armored cabin).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, transport-too small, short-range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
AF: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I got a wank right outside of town.
Nutrients were crawling out of the river, doing damage to crops, so I was there once.
As I approached, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but of course after a while the fox went.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman was shitting himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was for a fox.
By the time I got off the perch, he was gone.
I.e. Even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So in a visible place, put the expensive stuff at your feet in your sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
I.A. found respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts per respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices moving so dramatically?
Which authorities were economical?
And why did others buy more expensive?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of iRozhlas, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of ČSLA that older generations have experienced), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that the trained can take, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, plus modern technology is getting more complex, so the ability of the reservists will rapidly lose in time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also an explicit necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic will fight only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography.
We don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there are situations where you watch a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago drive into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss guys and you think, "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they treat him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "taking on a defender" is so terrible that I find myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker has managed to play off one of his opponents.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is well known: the omicron variant, which is most likely spreading faster than the current Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from a previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected plus-side phenomenon has also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalizations by one third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first shipments of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the incoming drugs.
As stated, Merck’s molnupiravir is the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up first on the tape because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beak has grown".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means losing your job and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both polled at over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical for the purpose of rotating units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the SSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads, because of the more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the whole rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on a carrier device.
Except for the museum maple, the rest are in disrepair.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was a little overbearing, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everybody talked to him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was very close, he was regular, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he wore clean clothes.
He went to school in the outdoors, did all sorts of shenanigans, but he was fine, probably never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies, joined the same class, another class.
Shortly thereafter, a teacher was beaten up, police were often involved, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an advertisement (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I've sold often to Gypsies, they've always had the money, they didn't try to get me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car that way, the guy called in a month later and said he'd signed it over to him.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just common behavior).
But when someone comes in, they reach out, they empty out apartments and houses, they're just a mess, they cause trouble... no matter what color they are, I don't care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene despite resuscitation care," spokesperson for the South Bohemian medical rescue workers Zuzana Fajtlová told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons yet to be determined, he turned in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, the accident was described by the spokesperson of the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” says the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he has to add VAT and forward data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail telling him that customs is expecting the package.
It is then sufficient to fill in the details of the consignment and, if VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will charge it on the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
Where the addressee does not carry out the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that are needed and filled in on time, we would be about half there," says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, a raise (who is the employee)?
I got a 2% raise in gross this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for even six months?
This just blows my mind, how can a court send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover.
Won't this also deter potential future rape reports from victims?
The man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped officers secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He had summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after the 911 call, and were surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to arrive at the scene.
In fact, all he wanted from the officers was advice on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
After checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers discovered that the woman was on a wanted list, a nationwide manhunt, and was subject to an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer Slavic ethnically or culturally, but I would like your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something without evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there's at least one god in one of those thousands of religions who will punish you badly if you believe in another.
But even in the Ten Commandments there is no god but Yahweh.
In that case, wouldn't it be more rational to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god I didn't just hit sending me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training followed by reserve.
The Swiss model is similar, I believe.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All the forces of the ACR could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being rehashed, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of intermingling where the workforce migrates from educational institutions into employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is continuous, each of us constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German, or even a Mongol invader will never come here again.
​I find it funny how you see NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if we get into trouble.
Oh, my God.
One election in the U.S. that cuts their budget, and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once that they just have to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is a heavily armed army and a population that can master the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, any teenager can fly a remote control device, so I don't know what to do.
We don't need border fortifications, that's a bitch these days, but a pimply teenager behind the wheel of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You open your gifts under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're home stuffed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is being re-used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This has created a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is therefore a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the shop involved (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, it also strengthens my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugstores and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Individuals and businesses together make us a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations," says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All the garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are being added to help find uses for things that would otherwise become useless waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean Up the Czech Republic.
It seems wrong to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency over the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron’s supporters, straddling the right and left, agree on little, but they agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for head of state in April.
The electoral calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe,” and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticize Macron for his pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now, arguing that the Vichy regime that collaborated with Hitler during World War II was not so bad, and has had some success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of a history book seriously, and let's not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as an us-versus-them story and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they had an enlightened teacher, they would never know what the larger context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he stayed on the first rung of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.

Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on December 20, will include a traditional literary appendix.
And along with it will come out cultural tips.
We attach the books to you, the subscribers, in addition to this digital edition, so that you may have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.

A tale of a return to the roots that turns out to be nothing more than a desired illusion.
A bohemian and a comparator transmits the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the scenery of the present village.
Its brutality surpasses popular versions and it graduates into a horror film about emotional emptiness.

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a life together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
Starting on Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, the departure time will be adjusted only, or their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services daily, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be operated daily.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections under the new timetable, the runways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be operated by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
Czech Railways will replace the carrier after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
A total of 16 services will be operated daily by RegioJet, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout works, the carrier also tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be replaced by the German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex trains.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in the schools that the blacks were often sold into slavery by the blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one teaches you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, but everywhere they tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in the schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, while we're on the subject of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they've had some good successes of their own, and I find it absurd to dismiss them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better, as a lot of people idolize it these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slaver, and they hated a lot of things, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and perhaps our view doesn't exist with them (there was also a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires in 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that some of the universities were appalling, the students were quite radicalised, and the schools often encouraged them to do so.
And when I imagine that these people are going to be much older one day, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's been radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, so other groups like LGBT themselves, and it leads to radicalization on the other side as well, often leading to resistance even on quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't seen anyone condemn me for colonialism or slavery either.
Rather, I encountered the wrong geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of a personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some shit about the coronavirus that makes everyone ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they attend services to the Hussites because it's a lot like that in theology, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even have a Latin Mass every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. like they did in front of Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the squad and I participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said Girl Scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing point in the parking lot.
Usually, though, the Boy Scouts take the train to Vienna to pick him up.
There is no change in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the Scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where it will be handed over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be handled by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame around the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Boy Scouts must comply with the measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
This is similar to last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep the intervals, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that is as safe as possible," said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Lights event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the faithful, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will put the money to good use, but I do not understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and interferes with the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" signs in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that's giving jobs to people, this is holding back a development where this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's gone.
I totally agree, it's horrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age gets caught in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm moved by online ads, but then I catch myself that they've affected me, too - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising.
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the Internet.
I feel that this belief has its roots in (but predominantly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'm going to say is cryptic thinking."
"I'm not going to believe everything the media says."
"I don't trust politicians."
Television has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, with 200 of them premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend for Christmas movies, presenting a record of more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas, family and romantic films has been scoring well with audiences and increasing the audience significantly, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, there were four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those pictures that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday films in reality.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, and films such as Home Alone, Love in the Sky and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real Christmas boom did not start until 2009, when Hallmark, an American cable television station, came up with a special film series, the BBC pointed out.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter all that much, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray said.
For example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, resolves and the two of them kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another," Gray adds.
Mazepin had positive text on covid-19, he will not interfere in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to be attacking a better position from the 20th place he had finished in qualifying.
But Russia's Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not make it to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last rung and Max Verstappen first to face Lewis Hamilton in a straight title battle.
According to the Haas stable, Mazepine is relatively healthy and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all stakeholders," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
Any substitute would have to complete a qualification or a driving session at another part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not deal with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had a covid-19 at the start of the season, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater impresses!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, they never wore sweaters much at home,” confesses Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend to be washed.
And there's another problem.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as fast as I can," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to assist Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has formally requested the assistance of NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
There are already British and Estonian soldiers on Polish territory.
The Omicron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's looking into another kid from Adam's.
"Currently we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's prep class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms.
No one has ever traveled abroad with suspicion of Omicron.
None of them had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of them, Ciupek said.

California will restrict the sale of guns.
He wants to do the same thing as Texas on abortion.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit brought by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsome’s announcement responded to the US Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday that kept Texas’s abortion ban in place, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US until roughly the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now ruling not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In fact, enforcement of the ban in this case has been made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
“If states can now block federal review of their laws, California will use that power to protect lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on a measure authorising public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This refers to homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and legal costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute, or sell assault rifles, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state did indeed reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas ban on abortion full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are improved on the basis of the results.
For example, studies on the effects of a 4-dose dose are already pouring in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, she'll have her vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market shortly.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, it would be against the law for the European Commission to use the new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland’s plan to draw €36 billion from the EU’s Recovery Fund for the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building "impossible conditions, because its aim is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictation by blackmail and by trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on a government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels as would result in Poland's sovereignty being curtailed.
"We will never agree to Poland being a colony," he said.
But knowing about it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt more than once, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes on the milk shelves, I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector all the choice, less common and special cheeses were there, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to, I won't even go to the store anymore, action or no action, golden shop in the square, maybe they don't have that kind of choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and there's an order to it, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.

Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I got a few punches on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and to the extent) is beneficial, because the child responds to it much more than words.
What's important, I think, is the warning part, because it kind of gives the kid the choice of disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not getting punished.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defense
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, responded to a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred charter on which he is sworn and about which he has been taught in school since he was a child, or an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was decidedly in favour of the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and make them more economical with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we impose bans on politicians.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a few months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told News.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are paediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It takes place in a clinic for childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
Children with postcovidius syndromes were in the ward, according to the doctor, continuously throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covidal pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies of several months in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“We currently have a child of several months and adolescent age with us,” said the head doctor.
He is pleased, however, that the children's hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any deaths from the coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in a children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus ward - it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
It also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovidius syndrome.
“Therefore, the administration of the vaccine dose is recommended in children as well,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside of the marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).

China gives the impression of a controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
Sinologist Jirouš: China gives the impression of controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for failing to stop a contagion that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, including in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?

After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
Lawn trampled, giant shit everywhere, car split, kids scared of it, and wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold says: you speak ill of an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course for international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought of that, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm a quibbler.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
Let me take an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for “Spanish fruit and mandarins” it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is “all American forces” including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it's already covered in the broad term, and there's no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just quibbling :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured marmoset monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before being flushed down the toilet by its callous owner and laughed at.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life, and must pay the equivalent of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered gruesome footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her apartment on a drug charge.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing profanily.
In the next video, Holland is heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house, she found £1,600 worth of cocaine hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like, freshman year, you're gonna take the same stuff you took in sixth grade?
And it's all being killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Just take the test at 1 and then nobody cares.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the absolute majority of them don't give a shit and tell you they're completely fucked.
Then what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is, people don't want and don't need.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine, I was totally serious about it... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In our country, our communist past and our persecution against the educated and the elites probably contribute to this) But the cost of having barbarians standing by the machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, the covid here would probably never have reached this size.

Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea said on Instagram in Stories, responding to inquisitive questions from curious fans about what had disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it from her social media.
Kadri and Andrea had been on edge since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move out with her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect, even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri said angrily, responding to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling, and debt.
Even his younger sister, Linda, didn't like the supposed sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife.
She decided to stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on things like that at all, and even in my family, we've never said much of those things.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't get it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I'm even more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I really wish everyone knew Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else, and we know the reality and we know the truth, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cao began his robbery in a residential parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he could think of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
A security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the landlord woke up in the morning, he found the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed the money, drunk he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business.
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right of assembly will be restricted but not abolished.
More than 60% of voters turned out for Saturday's municipal elections.
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lusatia in Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
There were 99 candidates for a total of 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies," said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that the covid-19 epidemic had made elections more difficult in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komni, Hungary, the Independent Candidates' Association won Saturday's election, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means she won two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the assembly, with 18.52% of the electorate giving them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privately.
One seat in the council was won by Komňany – independent candidates.

Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I resent how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell upside down from twelve meters.
He survived hitting the concrete.
An incredible fall on Sunday night was survived by a man in Ostrava, who was attended by rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, the Regional Operations Center responded to a distress call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that a 27-year-old man was supposed to fall out of a window from a height of about 40 feet and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should have been, and the fire department went in.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of death.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the next care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than I am about the coronavirus, about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the disease is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Cutter.

The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña has beaten legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, he did a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France was also victorious, beating Cody Garbrandt by a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight contest between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary dwarf, for Nunes had not lost in seven years, and she was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to knock her down.
Peña, however, did not allow herself to be forced into any more errors and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with the hand lever.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both combatants landed a number of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Peña got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and knock it off.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier was better off, but gradually the tide began to turn.
In the other, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
He didn't do that very well, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and hit him with a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to beat the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a brilliant victory against Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of well-aimed punches and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes had another triumph with her little daughter, and now, after seven years, she had lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical genus, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are male, female or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns with which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two houses.
They then take on dual terminals during declension and in some cases remain in the non-inclined form.
For example, the words "wriggle" or "hip" are of both male and female gender, in the former they are slanted according to the pattern "machine", in the latter they are slanted according to the pattern "song".
For the other group of nouns, the shapes are already different in the first instance of the singular, for example: ‘row/row’, ‘kohlrabi/kohlrabi’ or ‘potato/potato’ (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-scriptural, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "doughnut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some of the words that came into Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but they gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained rigid in the middle genus, but has endings in the male genus along the lines of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way towards the southern borders of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what is the situation on the ground?
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we choked, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has faced for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent the drastic fallout, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's unpleasant for people to have to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to avoid it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how those people are often treated by their neighbors or even by the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
The trend has been for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the allegations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping sex offenders.
Czech Republic floods with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish
Prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
It put a lot of people in a tough spot.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished houses and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete already-under-construction family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move into unfinished houses.
In a worse case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three single-family houses in a year, and fifty percent of us do.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earnings," said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of the construction company.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they had expected the house to cost them five million, now it would cost them seven.
I think some of them will be waiting," Sullivan added.
Copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
“The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said Křeček.
We're good, and we're gonna be even better.
But there is no real vision, says ČRO commentator – myRozhlas
Beyond the traditional celebrations, the entrance to the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and ANO President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As in, I find my thesis cool right now, I have my own topic that I've chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a year, and then in a week or two I write a written part.
Statehouses are very quiet in our country, unless you're a total maverick and you've got something left in your head, the committee won't stifle you with a theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the State Department, and when I was at my wit's end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical inference, which I immediately realized, and I got it right.
Anyway, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's cool if at the end of the course there's an exam that reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
But don't overload your e-mails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy may not have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along, or something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Pooh Bear statue.
You need to put it in such a way that it touches Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta is giving artists a hard time.
If you don't give the stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the bare minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's pissed me off lately, so I might have to stoop to the tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my line of work have been successful and they're not even close to letting it happen.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly to come along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement by the Workers' Party in Donbas
The Union - yes, broken - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the Belovezhsky Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open and lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that “the Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With a stroke of a pen, they “abolished” a vast country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years in a single session in the White Forest had betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, put the brakes on agriculture, ripped off fourteen republics from the world's greatest power that had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today, mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not be directly correlated with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK/kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit about how if something's cheap, it's guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or poor is very retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
I went to Brno recently and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take this kind of stuff to help the temps, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the workings of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected she was some kind of agitator.
After I finished reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lectures, like washing up and not being a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to indulge this person because you love him without even realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she'd cry and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started getting fucked in the head.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her, but that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and keep her from running amok again.
Such a person will drain you of feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are frantically stealing in by buying a bunch of tests and rushing the positives, who wouldn't even know about the horrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is complicating things for companies, carriers, and others because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the West, they had stopped their antics and accepted that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Valek's new, and he's got some thieving to do, and he's got to drive his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we've got some good old-fashioned trash coming back.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "don't worry about it, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offered, as I wanted to help people, but the training sessions were more about scaring and talking people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to whip up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only ones that made you feel like a pot salesman.
What I can tell you is that the experience was valuable, and you learned not to jump on the bandwagon and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even useful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporation I work for.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own business and they don't stick their noses in anything.
So the regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that it's going on with us it's pretty good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what came out and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone judging you by any numbers, that sort of thing.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works, so they don't bother us much as long as the results are in.
A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police this afternoon confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is under investigation.
With respect to the family, we will not disclose any more information about the case.
My condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28, coming home from work, and she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her work colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Interpol reported her missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this connection several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but she did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new councils were created at the end of the year.
On Saturday 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lusatia in Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
There were 99 valid candidates for the 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
They registered the highest interest in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new council elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for the 28 council posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put more demands on equipment and personnel security," Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while at the very beginning to come to terms with the fact that we had a fairly dangerous contagious disease, but there were no major hitches.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population at all its levels, that's what I'm having trouble with until now.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his ability to regain it.
The chances of that actually happening, however, are very slim, as others here have pointed out.
Besides, I'm not sure that shredding a file would even qualify as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Increasing number of people under 35 who are without sex all year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who have reported that they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One could be the economic impact of a coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, has also contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people; by 2021, only 5% of them said they had not had sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
While spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that they are a minority among the single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is pushing the trend," Stone says of this thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less religious," the trend went from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people with no or lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, replacing this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole point of mandating vaccination against covids is whether society should force a section of the population into behaving that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e. the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, then it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have been responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get inoculated, and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think we are responsible for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it's pretty clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they'll really have themselves to blame.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent years.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for combating drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a religious man.
One day in high school, our teacher took us all the way across town to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there we went down one of these quite wide streets, and who do we not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but he and a friend got talking.
When she left, my teacher and I asked her what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she said.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're very spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After earlier visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must collectively make it clear that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border should be addressed through diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy Group, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, artificially created the migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegally).
He has discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her license for failing to give right of way and for fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her license after they found out she had a blood alcohol level of over two.
At the same time, she was told that she would be confessing her actions in court.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Sajmovič, however, did not guard his film.
Czech family comedy makers have seen themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But what they forgot was the essential thing: the rules of the movie business.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, another film called Here We Guard is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Sajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Here I Guard from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some of the familiar figures around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava boarding house, which is dying, so they start to invite dog-walkers, Julie's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Sajmovic (who is also a producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that elicits a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's review.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing field trip with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the woods, who falls into a coma, and is then taken away from the hospital by her family so that a miraculous process of dog healing can take place in the heart of Šumava's solitude.
Nothing against nature's cleansing cure and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a doggie contest, a Sumava charlatan, cops coming to a tip-off in search of “drugs” and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs – and which, of course, the baked family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma, and then sits perfumed and made-up with a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and meatloaf as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, he explains to the viewer that “that sometimes happens after a coma.”
Sajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to build load-bearing situations, feeling for characters and punch lines, and direction.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only positive feature of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomko and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog-talk, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters perpetrate.
The argument is not even the age-old membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man and dog there must be a knowledge of craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little too much eroticism and not enough feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurish stunt would fail.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that crap all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in my case a part-time job.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost total absence of precipitation during November, as observed at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It's also the right Christmas setting, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, and is occasional and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater resource, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring with the last three rainy winters.
It's been dropping ever since.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"Depending on global warming and climate change, it can be expected that precipitation may decrease," Israel Water Authority spokesman Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Worse off are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
Tank trucks are piling up on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"My orders are up seventy to eighty percent this year compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said that negotiations in Vienna had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Secretary of State Benny Gantz said Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had produced “no progress” and that world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing games with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been prying and grilling the young lady in conversation to see what she wants me to do.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these tricks, I continued to annoy the lady with doubts and questions for a while, and finally thanked her and left.
You can call me a thug, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snow at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operation as a result.
The skiers were not dissuaded by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lifters do not complain about customer indifference, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region took to cross-country skiing tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna on Šumpersk were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are awesome.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, he did not spare praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell the ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents," René Hroneš from the Spindleruv Mlyn ski centre told the Czech Press Agency.
"We've only seen incident units," he added.
Some ski equipment rentals and stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava shop Skiopava.
He expects a greater surge in the ski course season.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that because of the covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By now, before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told the Czech News Agency.
People, he said, had become lazy with the pandemic and had learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental agency in the Novako complex on Boží Dar is experiencing great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
“We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a good life here, as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people go abroad who have no property here.
A business owner doesn't just go abroad.
But I agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election.
If life's bad here, some traditional V4 freak might win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can't be put on a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmayer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for the shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior, and we're getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that might help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and she worked here for our health service," Harman said.
Police had earlier arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine that way.
These are not "huge quantities" but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we exaggerate the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made you think Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons with the situation in '38 are off at so many points, I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to honour the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) will be faced with several changes starting on Sunday, particularly concerning suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed routes, and others ceased to exist.
Mladá Boleslav is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, the fast trains from České Budějovice stop at Zahradní Město station.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains run from Beroun to Český Brod through Prague's main railway station.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will be newly stopped by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will be expanded to other areas.
Among other things, there will be buses to Svetlana nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladá Boleslav will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
With integration, 77 lines will be discontinued, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operational lines will be adapted.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague Zličín, which will run all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
The morning rush hour and the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník will be reinforced, when the express line number 404 will start.
Lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonný in Podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on a dozen local lines in Central Bohemia is newly cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Praha – Beroun, Praha – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
Routes 540 to 543 on Nymburk have been changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only place to get food is next door to Billy's or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy only pizza, buns and a snack of yogurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you, I'm afraid.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're banned from skiing off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing more than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been going steady since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has missed the fact that Dara has captured a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to her ears.
She said he picked her up, not the other way around.
They've been the center of attention for three days, and although they're used to public attention, they're not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't give a damn and it's popping out of the can, or us whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's as if one of you wants an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are suited to each other, or if you insist that everyone really knows the details of your ex-partners and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was visiting to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been a long-term vice-president of Juventus Football Club.
They were coming clean now, waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana had been separated for three years, but they had not been married on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We, too, are only human, with families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commentators have probably said all the essentials, I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to begin with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments don't usually advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides it is close to most faculties of BUT (I don't know exactly where you are going).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
But this is an example of perfectly "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can teach whatever they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or they can follow the state and the state will pay for it.
We can't let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full state contribution and can learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it is written by a man who, two days before, had said so about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitisation that (even long-time professionals) either throw it in the eye somehow, or write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I wouldn't exactly recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a good, dedicated student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'm guessing the author or the printer simply created his own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't that the Odrynian Empire rather than the Odrynian Empire?
Shh. Somebody already cracked this place for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'topic' of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is amusing.
All the important approvals are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus, with the English thing, it's kind of interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Ceil.
It's my third year working there, and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I drive home from work at 10:00 at night and never have a problem?
Only someone who's never set foot in a ghetto can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't :And it's certainly not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Dada and the lover Gelema as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen this wreath, and I'm sure Lucy has one, too," the saxophonist told Lightning, confirming Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annie, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy something for both Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video launch at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know any other ingredients that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Policemen are few and cannot afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are not at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, and there has been less precipitation in places where there has been no shortage of water.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage land also amplifies the impact.
Prepare for what in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's the way it is, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey, and the tactics (I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total hoot, too.
And whether you're a "Russia Bear" hockey team or a "China Lama" hockey team, losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they skewer, what the referees notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And even if it were the other way around, it's the same as always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic in 1967 at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor for the British Office of Health Security, said on television Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection, and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister argued that the quiz was "virtual", via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán’s 12-year rule.
This will be an election of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
Not fair.
Nor are they likely to be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be a question not of whether Fidesz would win, but of how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security, was leaked to independent media.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
Everything starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I was very angry as a child, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, and they took me to the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me educatively, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, I used to fight quite a bit when I was a kid, now I hit something for discharges, and when I was younger I slapped my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get too much of a punch), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, maybe it's impossible not to screw up their kids a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
Kundami, then, I would call those who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a blackout?
Can we really count on people wanting and buying the product and you'll have something to pay the mortgage with?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial of the four accused of the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It has stirred up civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the leaders of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a break will the process be for Slovakia?
This is all the fault of the press.
How is it possible that this petition got an order of magnitude more media attention than the anti-petition by the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled, and the company took the fall.

Another government shuts down and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository is missing.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs a fundamental overhaul.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected when choosing and permitting a deep-sea repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delay.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect from the Act a stronger strengthening of their possibilities when deciding on the repository, as mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticised by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the site selection for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Management to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a substantive plan almost completely ignores public involvement and makes municipal citizens practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of locating and selecting the site for the repository, its authorisation and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a site for a repository.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they make comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or the minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
An action, if any, shall have no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of self-government that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
Moreover, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, vice-mayor of Cejle municipality from Hrádek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: "After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction in a similar way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for potential storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Though he hadn't felt the need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he'd been spooked by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on which boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that's expecting readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, perhaps a college text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
Plus, there's more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so the "boss" is kind of like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (only Catalan is interesting, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for a story or game, a computer-controlled opponent stronger than all the others and guarding the completion of a level or a task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been wanted since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow memo about her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech Police is working closely with the British Police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra was announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin, with brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
The MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We're very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
It's not clear who he is or what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month's attacks intensified significantly as the year ended.
We had a big campaign on Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
So far, the attackers' strategy remains the same.
An infected attachment in an e-mail is meant to draw the user's attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November caught rather global campaigns.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months, recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity.
Today's demo of brainiacs who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or sections of the population has led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-dragons and associates couldn't have filled or paid for a parade this big.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are growing in popularity, reminding me of A Million Moments for an Upside-Down Democracy.
Sometimes I think they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It won't be a left-wing or a centre-left movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to have a booster every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant scientific achievement of which mankind is justly proud.
End of stalemate: Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office in a few days.
The country’s political crisis has been ongoing since April, when the last government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties, preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power, failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.

"Secret" footage is a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived is also calling for information on the staff of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior, and we're getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that might help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The Šumperská amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the county pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous tipster to be violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court accepted that the paintings of Mole in the rooms of Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was life and death.
The Municipality referred complaints to the RMD, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to gape.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership and after a month the RMD began to "intensively address the situation".
