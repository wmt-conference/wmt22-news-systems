The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I am a #PRS_ORG # major customer and so it's no problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG # a few days ago... for 249€.
Today, it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get a credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help with the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
It is best for you to judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him falling asleep for hours.
Legally speaking, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk that you want to take is of course up to you;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I don't want to think of the title anymore maybe someone here knows about it...
The story was about anxiety and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a brief investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who, before each suicide, is commissioned anonymously to go to the scene of the suicide and to document it and to post the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out the window another drives herself to death on purpose)
Facing fear is referred to in the book as “the fight.”
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot I'm pretty sure that the original book was written by a French author/author.
If anyone is aware of this plot or someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the WiFi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to have the price difference remitted?
child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumb nail (outside) over the entire length.
Trying to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any H0 and 0 gauge locomotives.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm “sugar cube” loudspeaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, decoders log on to a suitable digital center fully automatically.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable control panels.
Auxiliary registers exist for control centers that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx® -compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking distances as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake components or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railways.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push ahead with booster vaccination
Politics and science are constantly raising new Omicron cases in Great Britain.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Day.
London — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on corona booster vaccinations than previously targeted in light of rapidly rising Omicron figures.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, as long as at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, there is an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
“Get boosted now!” Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I've sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not “Peter”, but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she comes from a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
can anyone help me please
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over an official's feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect when sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG #.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG #.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG # but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I'm going to write something a bit more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something off my mind.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims don't want to be helped or think we couldn't help them.
It is perfectly clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not simply have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help with that in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier as a result.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
“Arcane” on Netflix: What good is the series for “League of Legends”?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: “Arcane”, the series from the “League of Legends” computer game universe, has recently been released on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two season that has already been announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP giants Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
Youngster Johannes Patrick could at least be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim cup defeat at the beginning of October: “We still have some anger in our guts.”
However, it didn't subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
The manner of the performance was even more disappointing than the naked result.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any more questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: “We simply weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't do what we trained.”
Which is to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: “To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg,” said the lucky coach.
“It felt like 10,000 people did.”
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
“The best playmaker I've ever trained,” Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.
The giants are already welcoming the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7 pm), in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I've changed it.
Yes, I got in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.

Always peeled out of an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program “Guten Tag, Liebes Glück” - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe would actually have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of that.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - “on official instructions” in order to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent season must also be canceled, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates that had already been postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself in the style of the Comedian Harmonists with his repertoire of hits and chansons.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the “MTV Unplugged” series (2019) reached second place on the charts - just like his successful album “Für Frauen ist das kein Problem” (2013).
He has made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, his blond hair strictly combed back and careful of etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-language music landscape.
He has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
“Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure,” said Geywitz in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
Incidentally, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations, for example, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and an expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still doesn't relax, “we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps,” emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
Numerous tornadoes have passed through the USA in a devastating storm system.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320 kilometers long trail of devastation, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado went through, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings — just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and official figures are rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that the display case #NAME # is sold out.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
until when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item or submitted a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company that he blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see and drink tea.
It was a year ago.
He obviously didn't sew himself into his old spot and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take up the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with your first own campaign
Boron in salute!
I am currently leading the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specially written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big berth has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been made up and now I'm about to write the entry-level adventure and stumble over my own feet from the very first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuan.
The further plot is to develop there.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in a variety of ways: persuade, act, threaten, detect the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
When not noticed, the goblins lie in wait for the hero in a ravine and flank the carriage armed with three bows on the left and right, while two stop the carriage with spears.
Should there be a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village Schulzen, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should defeat be inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina to solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later on, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed to heed many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put it back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
Can you then have the return receipts come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG #.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has declined more and more, so I want to breathe a bit with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was canceled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and start accident, you would still have the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) can still show.
Apparently, however, it is the case that F1 enjoys priority for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished broadcasting the race.
Nevertheless, small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in F1, so both did not know that tires could be changed under a red flag.
Although this situation has already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I am of the opinion that you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork as to what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about rules.
In general, I don't like Roos's contrived commentary style, but admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better there.
There are also constant silliness that simply make both look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or “uuuuHD” by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he obviously doesn't take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the run-out lap, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV, as only the German audio track has to go without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also advertise less in the training sessions than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, but that alone doesn't let me ignore the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language station to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job apart from advertising in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG # pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was due to be delivered last week and it's still not being delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG # on 12/12/19.
One of them had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an air lift.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several vents.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the fan pump model, they are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or similar could be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air vent or similar by means of a 4/6 mm air hose... and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if water were to run backwards, the water from the pool running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that use little energy
Even though we specify the processing time here on eBay as 3 days, packing is done daily and parcels are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it's very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be the case that not everyone understands all the employees who also work in freight forwarding... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
People like to grumble about these services, of course, even if we say at the moment... they have a damn hard time
This is also very different from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Do you also know how to order the legs in bright here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's “New Shepard” rocket system from Blue Origin.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back,” said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and did everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
“New Shepard” flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The missile system “New Shepard” flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above ground, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned all-outing: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek,” as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy boss of Blue Origin Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and regardless of the climate.
At the touch of a button, you can easily select whether your “smart stone” should shine permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to change color, the luminous stone retains a light color for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the “Smart Stone” luminaire is proven outdoors all year round.
In fact, their light is particularly good in snowy surroundings — only a shorter lighting time can be expected as soon as the days turn out to be shorter.
In winter, please only make sure that no snow impairs the function of the solar module.
“Smart Stone” uses a NiMH battery in the usual Mignon (“AA”) format, which can be easily replaced if required.
You can purchase a suitable replacement battery from our web shop and thus extend the service life of your decorative lamp even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and standing in the laboratory doesn't bother me either (I've already completed my inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also found out about career prospects before I started my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would certainly like to and will study until I finish my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly oppressive about the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck, etc.), you always hear great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I would be really interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really uncertain at the moment and may be considering dropping out of my studies and training as an IT specialist in 2022.
If you have any experience there, feel free to write them:)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
I came up with this topic last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why only now a post on it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, are there great stress in our company.
It seems that they also exist before public holidays plus long weekends.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption Day, which we in Switzerland call the “Auffahrt”.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies have a bridging day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what went on last week
Stress everywhere.
A lot of emails that absolutely had to leave before the ascent, order here order there, everything *unconditionally * before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because “next week then” sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be the case?
Or because people in all seriousness want to do as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What is this self-hostage because of holidays
Why do we still have public holidays if we can't really treat ourselves to them?!
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent.
My question is simple: Are only we like that, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed Protestant style?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but doesn't have any presents yet.
“The nice thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest,” said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking and making cookies with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: “For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I finally have to get started now.”
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting process and new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 mcg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-organic gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to a lack or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds.
No other vitamin supplement should be given while using NEKTON-BIO.
NEKTON-BIO is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you so much I've found
Unfortunately it still doesn't work
GDR handicraft model old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayman ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, may also have come from the small series companies ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are refurbished for operation
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG thus determined delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01—06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn repair plant in Dessau, the worthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When, as the Central German grid progressed, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were preferably built up.
It was only when it was foreseeable that the workup number could not be increased any further in the case of the E 94 did the E 95 become the focus of the workup.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation plan, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
It often happened that contactors stuck during switching operations.
Then the sideman, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to release the shooter again while driving with a hammer and wooden wedge.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months-long failures of the locomotive.
[5] Since enough new-build locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most types of fragmentation, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives with one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01, which resigned from service on October 5, 1970.
The envisaged new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial exterior refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The interior of the locomotive was completed in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is looked after as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Hall P community have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Arnstadt Museum Bw with new inner and outer paintwork, during which the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to become a Central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in original box, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in-house, dusty, with signs of play, cellar smell!!! , very rare handicraft model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series companies ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and signs of storage.
yes the F parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The center beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now
I can't set up the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center bar does not fit into the bracket provided.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
no no flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I have this sent to you?
Hello #NAME #, should I explain the problem to you again
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, there was an estimated loss in the six-figure euro range, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume that the fire would be set intentionally.
The Fürstenfeldbruck police department has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Ugur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network “LinkedIn”
Biontech boss Ugur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
Şahin said that a friend's illness had prompted him to do so.
CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine,” Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
“For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He didn't ask why.
“However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.”
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, and sometimes it is better to share personal experiences because of this.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Ugur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
“I am currently not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself,” Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization for vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases therefore probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to live without electricity for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The utility company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely remedied late in the evening.
THW firefighters and helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and THW for their tireless efforts,” said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology in a statement on Saturday evening.
It will take a few more days to repair the damage, as Westnetz fitters were only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation at first, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 PM severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 18:00 on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9:30pm.
Since 11:15 PM, those most recently affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance following the installation of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
“It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and tell local firefighting equipment stores when help is needed,” explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power units, the focus was primarily on residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to authorities, childcare places have been temporarily set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who need current-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.

The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I hadn't restarted the E- #PRS_ORG # before buying it.
Should I do that now
I find such a low credit note almost outrageous.
We disagree with that

To ensure that the paint application is uniform and clean, you should clean the components from dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse them with clear water and dry them off.
Before applying the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part
Draw the brush evenly, stroke next to stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers ensures a uniform surface later on.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic shades and metallic colors come with a separate brush at the very end.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve a true-to-original look thanks to the decals or decals.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be or more easily glued on before it is installed in the fuselage.
Time, patience and a steady hand are even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them for you.
Decals are also called water slide pictures because you briefly moisten their back with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you just slide the image off the paper a small piece and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check that the image fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Vacuum off excess water with a household towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and download the book again and find the place to where I've read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this via email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages
ok thank you anyway!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But will I get that back without any problems?
Fertility treatment for private health insurance /What is an “insured event”?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with private health insurance, it suddenly goes wrong.
In turn:
We had applied for fertility treatment from the private health insurance company in advance and received the approval of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with private health insurance.
We again applied for reimbursement of costs from PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive with private health insurance), we submitted the bills to PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish to have children is a new insured event.
According to the terms and conditions, however, “The insured event begins with medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment.”
The questions for the experts in the panel here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should private health insurance have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts expire with birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance event?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts gave their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me the best way to reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything more from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME # (same address), they obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it that the chest of drawers arrives completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It says clearly that the repayment has been initiated and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG #
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure any other type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG #
These products are advertised with additional stools that can be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them from you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget movies
There is no general definition of exactly what a low-budget film is with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about this:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to find out the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it now also reliable?
thank you
sincerely
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.

“Half victory” against Belarus entails high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce “half a victory” in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus” border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in the long term, explained the researcher from the Berlin Science and Policy Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in very small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with people on the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
“It obviously cannot assert itself if a member state sets its mind to do its thing,” like Poland at the moment, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: An agreement in principle on asylum policy would be made more difficult because the line “border protection, border protection, border protection” has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
During the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza, the migrants threw stones at Polish officials.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to receive medical care from a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of enticing them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
EU commissioners also traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take domestic costs into account.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after disputed Formula One final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two breaks of rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has filed an objection following the controversial Abu Dhabi Formula One final.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken in violation of the rules.
A second appeal was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars moving in front of him.
I'll check that out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you

Judith Hermann read from her novel “Home”
As part of the reading series “LiteraTour Nord”, author Judith Hermann read the sold-out Blue Note from her latest novel “Home” on Friday and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her front door.
I submitted the contact form to return an item yesterday, but I didn't receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your bug that you fix and not all of our household.
Contact woman #NAME #.
I can't chat with them everyday
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME # would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG # bedside table and a return label.
This email hasn't come up yet.
I want to bring the package to #PRS_ORG # today.

Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an Afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it to their I.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply leave that completely.
Yes wow then you are as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set the whole thing off the ground.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just making nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and no longer to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually without distortion and chromatic aberration right up to the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the “Technical Data” table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including folding magnifiers.
Thanks to an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions (available in German and English).

Christmas sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women pick out Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even gone home without his partner because both could not agree.
He plants a good 2000 pieces for this every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That always makes the run-up to Christmas a bit funny, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and have now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate that accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning skewer.
And that's why they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the “turner”, which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
problems with fiber + Devolo DLAN/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems establishing a stable WiFi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo dLAN, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly apart from a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the dLAN module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrives at the other dLAN module that emits the Wifi, but the further I move in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\ ~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the dLAN, there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is “lost” over the power line with fiber?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely complex to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch current account
Anyone who would have thought that current accounts would be quiet for now is deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to use all sorts of tricks from their customers to confirm past fee increases, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, has long been considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered it for overnight money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
However, these lower allowances now apply to Deutsche Bank as a whole, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for “newly made individual agreements with existing customers.”
Commerzbank had previously fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an exemption of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute ongoing there with the consumer centers, which have even been proven right against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly set aside provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But her life is like a ride up and down.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine “The Hollywood Reporter.”
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the “Friends” reunion and the sequel to her series “The Morning Show”, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Her appearance is taken care of by a whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
It's actually a miracle that the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her equally.
Perhaps because she is simply unlucky with happiness - and is still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula One was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight gang contact, Raikkonen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the “Iceman” ended his career in the top motorsport class.
As a farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich scores 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
“I've calculated that, I'd have to score nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He first fought off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, in which he drove from third to one.
He then changed the material setting somewhat and got a bigger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over Briton Brad Hall.
Austrian Benjamin Maier finished third.
“We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd win in series.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after second place before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after fourth place.
“If I knew what he does differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
For women, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in a two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the monobob the previous day, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple victory with pusher Deborah Levi.
Olympic two-man bobsleigh champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me along.
I'm super crude with development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay,” said Burghardt, emphasizing: “It's not just pushing, but there's also a lot to do around it.”
Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not entirely faultless journeys, but said: “It's heading in the right direction.”
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it was said that it has expired, which annoys me a lot.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently reduced:)
Why will the shipment only start on March 16?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message
It was approved by your colleague yesterday.
why is that a problem today
I've also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe one - or the other will feel the same way...
I am 24, have KPTSs, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in association due to burning).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week), which is very bothering me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomachache right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and stroking.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we divide up, of course.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is quite well adjusted right now, I am halfway well treated and I'm coping with it.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot right now (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll grab the Ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and “chaotic”, but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBS otherwise.
I think that sometimes has a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here for sure...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me
If we swap tables now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26/12. #NUMBER # sent.
Twice, by the way.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: Back then at school, I noticed that many religious teachers did not believe in God and that it was just another subject for them, such as math or geography.
It was always a bit strange for me, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
What's your opinion on this?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
Is there also a curriculum, etc.
But it would simply be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Maintain culture or something?
Hope you question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not I like to write English that I understand well
It's been a very long time, then I would refrain
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thanks for your support #NAME #.
movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live herself, I mean.
I think the crossing is also the soldier's burial place.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If that means anything to you I am grateful for any answer.
From week 1, our little one only slept on her stomach.
Fast forward: still alive:D
Just relax.
A child like that can withstand a lot more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no stuffed animals, go in and look more often, but not minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side
Can it straighten up a bit from the stomach
Or is it face first right in the mattress?
You can use this to deduce whether everything is okay.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, it was common practice, for example, to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already a “regular customer” with you and have already bought a lot of items
But then why are you only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC -ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I would ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not to be used in this way.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it is simply the case that the politics of this station are now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an “independent” Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to “be a running advertising column.”
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising channel that tries to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which apply to everyone, of course, except Simon and Etienne.
They can, of course, continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask you to call me back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus rupture due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG #.
Whether as a comforter for stomachache or simply for cuddling — my little warm friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat treatments, as cherry stones absorb heat very well and release it again in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion is easy to heat in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes it particularly pleasant to use, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odors, stick or burn marks and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover beforehand to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heats, a slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
It is essential to adhere to the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of flames and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as people with reduced pain.
If you have existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores emerge, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and out of reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it won't work under the third coach either.
Cheers in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was sufficient for operation.
No indication, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Maybe you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when plugged in?
Is there anything else broken
Thank you so much for your help!
I'd like the #PRS_ORG # delivered to my room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG # chair.
But I don't know how tall the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
20 litre capacity also swallows larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in terms of everyday objects remains well organized and separable from photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has a lot to offer - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: The first is conventional via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “fill levels”: there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the backpack's suitability for everyday use enormously: when you not only take your photo equipment with you, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side to access camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, while everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and don't get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the backpack's outer shell is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if you're due to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME # sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of
Contact from the freight forwarding company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table announced.
I haven't received any news yet.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support employee, with no one I got any further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME #
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It works.
thank you so much for the help
I wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER #. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
please give me a call
If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And I couldn't have guessed that the past year was going differently than expected and I wasn't able to redeem and clarify it on time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that in this way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who values reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure a high level of comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the gates improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was called “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You'll also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Their selection is then revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets banned!
This deactivates half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the start of each round and thus changes the available promotions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has concealed each location once and the year ends.
There is a gunfight in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

“Why children are not bullies” documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book “Why Our Children Become Tyrants” (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and legal guardians are now raising serious allegations against him.
Please watch out, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible people must never, never, never! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the frame for the child as large as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Länder discuss abolition of compulsory testing for triple vaccinated people
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of compulsory testing for triple vaccinated people.
“We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when compulsory testing can be waived for three vaccinated people,” Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, told the “Bild am Sonntag.”
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is “not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive,” said Holetschek.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised “that he will make a proposal on this to the Conference of Health Ministers as early as next Tuesday.” − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG # chair very nice, but I can't see how tall the seat is.
Can you help me out?
I can no longer make purchases with my #PRS_ORG #.
Display: Oops there was an error.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG # page on the computer is possible.
I've updated account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 in 1000.
The most common is to hear noise/voices, less often to see pictures and, of all, to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the preliminary anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but ** u/NiteMarex **didn't have any by definition.
I read her comment wrong.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the €20 doesn't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of e-commerce.
Please check again whether you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money there.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME #.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG #.
is that so
If yes, I'll have to cancel the order as I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theater story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, hot off the press: “An old man is getting older.”
The harrowing diarium of a slow farewell to the world that theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: “I am already witnessing my thanks to life here.”
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is Euro pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used primarily in Europe as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not charged

Roulades Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thanks again for that:)
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a beef stock for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG #?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can manage that
It's about a refund of € #NUMBER #
I was already informed by email on 18.01 that the refund had been made.
But I haven't received the money to this day.
Would you check that out, please.
Where are there still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck are part of Christmas days, like the Christmas tree and gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out now.
We'll tell you where else you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The “drive” of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
The VT+ series amplifiers also offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the “gain” and distortion.
It was already apparent above that you can even make a power reserve afloat with the POWER LEVEL controller when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently “acoustic” sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot switch, you can also call up the sounds conveniently by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and “tap” the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
As it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG # chairs
If it doesn't work, I would be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG # mirror (door) on the hooks provided.
That's not a satisfactory answer and it wasn't worth the wait
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iranian figures, progress is on the horizon in negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear deal.
“Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda,” Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a “positive and important development,” because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
The Vienna talks to revive the agreement continued on Thursday after an interruption of just under a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
The figure is the only federal state above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have a corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day figure of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence rate in Germany recently, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence rate in Thuringia fell slightly, but was also above the figure of 1000.
2242 new SARS-CoV-2 virus infections and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported in Thuringia within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 received intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery doesn't take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it right?
I don't have to click/specifie/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense, please.
8 euro return fee is an impudence in my opinion.
It's time for change
## #MBundestag Greetings, I'm u/Stratorde in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Wozu the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of Munich Day, you can see one thing: It is not extistent.
We have reached a state of winter rigidity and have extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Wo is the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction with how some things went down here and how we look in general.
In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many here are really still in the mood for the day of the MB.
#Was we need to change
At this point, the community around the day of the MB is asked who would like to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/EdizVEVO, who became aware of this project in recent days and found, simply put, a pile of broken pieces.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found each other who would like to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform for this purpose in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBund day work in the future?
* Which existing regulations must be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the time and desire, come to Discord, work with us and let's decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also pretty sad as the #NAME # is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG #, is it also available in oversize, i.e. 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG # must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you must clarify with #PRS_ORG # how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG # can always contact me by phone to arrange a pick-up appointment.
Are there assembly instructions?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself had also been a vegetarian for a few years before that.
When asked whether I had always wanted to be vegan and whether vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
It was that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to “clumsy” was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG # does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I won't be on site on the assigned date that #PRS_ORG # will pick up my return.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, unfortunately that can't be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative collection date please.
From 01.02. #NUMBER # I can be found again all the time.
Lahnsteiner weir prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz recently presented Lord Mayor Peter Labonte with a funding notice amounting to 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment trolley of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this,” says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, deployments are expected to increase permanently: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle and the continuing increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frozen because the whole campaign has already taken me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
OK, that's how it is then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG # for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

Thank you first for facing up to the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in civil service in a similar job, i.e. we were also arms bearers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be asked in a very simplified way.
Basically, however, it should be said that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that, of course, uniform and weapons bearers in particular, also attract people to the right of conservative magically, that these people will of course find it difficult to deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because of course, in addition to the average white person, you now have many Germans with Immigrant background, women and homosexuals too (and by that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because there are fewer or no such clichés in the executive branch, but completely normal men and women to whom you don't notice if they don't tell you) and I can and must rely on these people too because when in doubt, they save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds funny at first, these marginalized groups also take a conservative stance in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks it must please them, want to they are simply treated normally.
Back to the right, since police and armed forces are of course also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly make any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing people will certainly meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well combated and the whole thing is also counteracted with political education and education!
Germany is so internationally involved and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket from the German site.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered back in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME # before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG # basket for #NUMBER # Euro in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but for the rest of my life I have been more difficult than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything breaks down, and now and then it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it is actually never the case “that someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, it bothers me somewhere, but most of the time household simply loses to work and reluctance.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get tidier with a child?
We don't have one yet but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a
Because I have no incentive for me, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as there is no visitor coming and, for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
I'm looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-forming with special, wide embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (at arm and squats)

Seamless stretch panels on joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and squats)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and crotch ensure a snug, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back zipper, improving comfort, especially when bending over and mounting equipment to the surface.
The free flex zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of protection against the cold.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless thin (-2 mm) face seal to hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood)

A career in social work — as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have now finished training for about a year.
Unfortunately, I'm noticing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I've been thinking about starting over again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AEVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told several times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I don't know whether the specific day-to-day work is really as I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The AEVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code (“the simplest things are screwed up again”) and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help (“I should really know how to do that myself by now” /"I'll keep him with my stupid questions about work” /"he must really think I'm underpowered” etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to have mentioned it here.
But have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for a pickup appointment
What do they mean by giving back please!
When I download a book to #PRS_ORG #, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG # does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG #, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The bird breaks down the protein (protein) ingested with the feed into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and uses these in turn to build up its own proteins, which it also needs to form plumage.
Plumage formation in nestling and new plumage formation in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with particularly high demands on the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this course of administration of NEKTON-BIO, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be switched back to.

1 g NEKTON organic on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of organic NEKTON.
In the case of severe plumage damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of new plumage formation is visible.
The normal dose is then given until the new plumage formation is completely complete.
Storage: NEKTON-BIO should be stored dry, out of sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and pictures had been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in contradiction to the statutes
Hi r/LegalAdvicegerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a case application was submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that felling fruit trees and thus also walnuts is not part of the statutes.
However, the statutes explicitly state the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement now or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is yes whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious road accident at Selb

Good, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you first!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking up everything that can be thought up.
Before I go out here... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm doing the ref as a career changer right now.
Originally I studied something else and also worked in one area there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't name anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up as a teacher and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third “I Google other job postings”.
And it's only been half a year.
In the previous times, I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely done right now.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
It's a vacation now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening after work was my end.
I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and when viewed from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely closes down - if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I would like to have it that way for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but appropriate for it was paid and worked out together in a team and not as a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place in a year as I am now and am dissatisfied.
You notice it's all kind of confused, but maybe you, as an outsider, have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, which I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make any decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit, which perfectly recreates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state of the art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this ingenious circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances bubble.
With VOX's “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string action, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly depicts the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic series of losses in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win over the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it is completely adapted to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
One possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models in the Sony A7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store lots of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photo things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, at 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” Island Council President Mariano Hernández Zapata told state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damages
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees Celsius, has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cold lava created two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly severely affected, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper “El País.”
Christmas and presents
Christmas is just around the corner and children in particular will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving gifts, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making “social contract of primitive peoples,” escapes from the rigid routine and is filled with life again in the context of this tradition can be.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked Christmas days to giving presents.
Before that, gifts were presented to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into their window to save them another life in sin in one night.
This unconventional type of gift giving gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling children's boots with gifts in particular.
Protestants opposed this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as “veneration of saints.”
For these reasons, they are defending themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Santa Claus the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, it annoys only a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, gift giving day was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful mess about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Santa Claus, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the historical figure's rather strict Assyrian beard, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's business with a gun.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officers a little later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
The Kensington Palace area is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar panel for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Burn time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in color on the inside.
“Smart Stone”, on the other hand, is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly — either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design has been deliberately chosen: This modern light object presents itself during the day like a naturally shaped large pebble.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment — whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself major preparatory work: As a solar light, “Smart Stone” requires neither a supply line nor batteries.
Place the “luminous stone” in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two ground spikes provided provide a firm grip if required.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module conceals “Smart Stone” discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs — one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dawning falls, “Smart Stone” begins to glow automatically; in which color is up to you: You can choose from six attractive light colors — in addition to daylight white.
Switching off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done that several times before, it doesn't work.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 has once again been fundamentally improved.
A variably adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10 kHz to 50 kHz ensures super-quiet operation, especially for bell-armature motors — the typical “hum” is a thing of the past.
Load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique “Autotune” function allows the decoder to be automatically calibrated to the motor.
With up to 1.5A motor current, the LokSound 5 decoder delivers enough juice even for older motors.

pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year of Reddit.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, primarily because I had such unbelievably bad pain during my period and crappy PMS before the period.
Now I would like to stop that again, because chronic illnesses mean that I already have to take enough medication that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had explosively picked up pimples on my last two-year break from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really burdened me and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without fuss, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynecologist didn't take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is yet to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertal bad atopic dermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive nodule lichen and the acne issue.
I also have nutrition in the course of Chr. Illness tried everything possible and got stuck on a sugar, milk and low-meat mixed diet, because nothing else worked really well.
It may well be that hormonally simply the worm is in it, but if you have construction sites everywhere, like me, you just don't want to go looking for what else is going wrong.
I've already had everything from her colleague Semina or similar.
and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large
as it is available in large black

In the name of the people: laypeople pass judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench of judges in everyday clothes.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear a robe: Aldermen determine with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.

110 kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The permit for the installation of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction, which is due to begin in 2022.
Network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The underground cable, which is around seven kilometers long, will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER # has only arrived in parts so far.

This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment
thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER #EUR
No, it's for all books, so yes the request to #PRS_ORG #, as it's probably a general problem
Ref: Schedule Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having big problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free at school (which is annoying for geography).
It simply takes me a long time to plan my lessons right now.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me, every hour actually stands alone.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest an excessive amount of time for simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to set it up (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I'm rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets too.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG # from the order #NUMBER #.
I've actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG #, but I'd love to process the return as soon as possible for now.
Retailers fear Christmas shopping due to the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about slumps in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth in sales slumps in transactions with articles for non-daily use.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole,” said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost just under a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things only go well in food retailing and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
“2G in shopping won't get us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic,” he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the received wristband.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies were recently a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, while sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the midst of such important Christmas business,” CEO Wilhelm Wellner told the “Wirtschaftswoche.”
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort involved, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which “visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed.” dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG #.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame that was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
It looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it shut.
How do I have to proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or at short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work both on a movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach areas.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press one of the memory keys for a longer period of time and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when switched on again - Very practical when working in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery One of the biggest strengths of DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is also built in - a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two display indicators (the left battery on the top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply unit.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can attach directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and tough use.
A tilt joint is also included in the scope of delivery.
It's great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This means that you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories that you may still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I received it as a gift and it is too small :(
“Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had won twice in series last, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SBU turned on, shot off the frustration of a mixed start to the season within a good hour and won furiously with 5:2. “It's amazing what the boys did today,” cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave “blanket praise to everyone who was there.”
Initially, it looked like another dampening for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place, still short of their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusen team in the lead 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
“How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance,” continues Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to get back on the pitch for the first time since matchday four and his muscle injury he had overcome, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is unbelievably strong,” said the 27-year-old and was pleased with a look at the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to maintain the focus for the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned to do so in terms of personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to “go on step by step and remain modest” and “complete the tasks at this level” until the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday as part of the English week, an away game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 PM, Sky) is on the program.
I've just received the email that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I've tried calling #PRS_ORG # and having it redirect, no chance.
Can it be resent to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, it would mean that I won't order again because it took a long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG # chairs?
Damper for women's handball ahead of quarter-final against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women snuck off the floor with their heads hanging and blank looks.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now have to face hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent,” said national coach Henk Gröner.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game by everyone that we have to delete,” said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the semi-finals, there must be a significant increase against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic Champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
“We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense,” acknowledged backroom player Xenia Smits and demanded: “We must now quickly look ahead.”
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par with the kickoff.
Missed throws and technical errors in the attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 gap after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few saves.
The DHB team scored their first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick backlash.
However, this was not the initial spark hoped for.
The German women were hardly able to stage themselves against the aggressive cover of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavians' goal.
The 3:10 game was over after 20 minutes early, especially as backroom player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarter-finals.
It wasn't until the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection got into the game a little better and came close to at least five goals by the break.
The already quiet hope of a catch-up race after the change was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Gröner protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-off opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to get up to an increase in performance and left the floor as a clear loser.
ROOF advent calendar day 6: family traditions during the Christmas season

The title states that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since a large part of these will soon be ready, I will continue to vaccination centers in part afterwards.
I am happy to answer questions without time limits on organizational and human aspects as well as medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. “I take medication X, is it compatible with vaccination...”).
My area of responsibility includes information on vaccination, indication (person is entitled to vaccination according to the corona vaccination regulations and no reasons against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
However, we often don't have any vaccination teams with us, but “only” (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but who cannot (are not allowed?) to carry out vaccinations , so that I also do most of the vaccinations myself there.
Serious “Huidlerer” question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a “Huidlerer”?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program “Wir in Bayern” caused heavy reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained in the series “Host mi?” Unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a “person who is nervous.”
And also no one “for whom everything has to go fast.”
People heard from the TV presenter that was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate residents.
“The Huidlerer,” the audience learned, “is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven.”
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the comment that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word “Houdern.”
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for a number of people who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG # gel #PRS_ORG #n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Choosing tires for road bikes - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of zest for action because I wanted to train at least a little more to prepare for my bike ride next week.
No sooner said than done and I rode off on my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurks.
Broken glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to go along the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't that bad in terms of whimsical technology, maybe it's better if I practice changing tires again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
It really wasn't bad now, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, demolished 120km until 2 pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he had been on a roll with them for several years.
But when I think about the fact that I still have to change tires when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm in a really bad mood: D
Now I got into conversation with an older man on the platform, who asked me in wonder why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be flattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I don't want to spend €40/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on my road bike at the moment.
They also exist (apparently?) for the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
is this a problem
Or would you advise me to use different tires for a road bike in general?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen is more likely to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this building proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to its principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but the sound level is to be exceptionally high.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tonally tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is common practice in broadband networks in order to optimize the bundling that is too high.
Aligned precisely to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outwards, the treble range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which are suspicious of reference, ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all panels have been cut to size (e.g. in a hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate location so that the cable can be easily routed through there later.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the “Detail Chamfer” image.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the base are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
A suitable circular saw or a Forstner drill makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the rear wall.
A round cutter is then used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off in this way.
The foot plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum/blow out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is to use the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear panel.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot up to the terminal opening and allowed to protrude there by approx. 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is routed to the loudspeaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions turnout Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed on, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
According to the description, the attenuation now follows.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed down with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone
> We can finally announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on a switch, so we'll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans on the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic — but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
