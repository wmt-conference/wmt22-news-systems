When I tried to buy the entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than double the orange color.
What's the difference?
Please tell me because I did not understand even if I looked up.
Now, there should be only blue.
If there is, it may be only that old products remain.
It looks just different and both are the same.

i don't want to watch tv anymore because i have that kind of thing.…
i wonder if it means that the entertainer became impossible?tv is full of entertainers.
I saw the Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there are quite a lot of scenes where the staff laugh behind me even when I'm saying things that are not particularly interesting.
It's obviously not a funny place, but it can't be creepy to laugh at everything you say because you're a selling entertainer.
But if you don't laugh at the staff, the mood of the entertainer will be impaired, and it will be bad for the relationship of the work.
Like the old black companies, that industry is like a physical education meeting, and some entertainers' egos are too big and they usually take a disgusting attitude, so I will not eat it.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of people who argue "Don't lick the entertainer" with the feeling that the entertainer himself has the difficulty of his work.
I know that the income is quite low until it can be sold, but even if it is said every time it is said that entertainers are standing at the top of the top of the jobs that are difficult to work.
It only sounds like a justification for the glorification of their own careers and the fact that comedians are too high in the media and in society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is also quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the entertainer world are becoming more and more impossible.
i'm sorry for complaining.
I felt that it was not good for my body if I did not put it out like a farts…

i was able to replace the items i ordered at the tsukumonet shop without permission.
Abstract: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, and I received a wired version of the mouse, and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund
It's more of a mail order trouble than a topic of homebrew PC, but it's a famous place so I can not be convinced even if I think about it, so let me write here
It was discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling at 3,280 yen (link destination fish Takaku) in the Tsukumo day sale of Tsukumo net shop that began from the previous Friday.
Because the wired version was the same price at the store, I thought about the possibility that it was not a mistake because it was 5,071 yen (link destination fish Taku) when I checked the page of the wired version in consideration of the possibility of price mistake.
I received the order email normally, and the next day I received the shipment email
THE NAME OF "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" WAS WRITTEN IN THESE 2 EMAILS AND IN THE purchase history OF my page
I had no contact or cancellation notice from the order to the shipment, so I thought at this point that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive
It was a problem from here, and a few hours after shipment, I got an email saying "there was a wrong registration of the product"
according to the email
* The wireless version was sold at a sale special price, but it was actually a wired version
* Since we have already shipped the wired mouse、
1.Refuse to receive and cancel all
2.Return mouse only and refund
3.Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose the correspondence of
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and even though it is written as the wireless version in the purchase history, e-mail, and delivery note, it seems that it was sent by replacing it with the wired version without permission.
I was sent something different from the product I bought without understanding, and if I wanted a refund, wouldn't it be terrible to send it back from here?
If you want to accept a refund in the end, please lend me your wisdom because i want to fight back with one shot.

isolated twice...The Only Bridge that Leads to the district due to Typhoons and Heavy Rain Spills Residents Stockpile Food 3 times <Fukushima Prefecture Yam Matsuri Town> (Fukushima TV) ・ Yahoo!News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto of Takachibara district, Yatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
It was the East Japan Typhoon in 2019 that had a big impact on the lives of 3 households and 8 people.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "At first I was like, 'Seriously?'
The only road leading to the Takachibara district, "Takachibara Bridge", was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, and 11 households and 30 residents of the district became isolated.
Residents who were forced to shut down the water continued to carry the necessary goods using the JR iron bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass through.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "Usually a car can come to the garden, but if you get off the car over there, take it in your hand, or carry it on your back and walk across the iron bridge and come here, so I felt grateful for transportation and cars." The emergency bridge completed after 1 month was washed away by heavy rain in less than 3 months and became isolated again for several days until the temporary bridge was put on. It was.
About 2 years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to secure 2 to 3 days."We have prepared about 3 times the amount of food that can be used for emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto : "I don't know when a disaster will fall on me, not someone else, so I felt once again that it would be better for everyone to stock up a little."On the other hand, Yam Matsuri-cho experienced an "unexpected disaster" when the bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town began its own initiatives in 2021.
Yam Matsuri・cho Education Division, Ryuichi Takahashi Section Manager : "I want to set it in the form of 'Yam Matsuri-cho Disaster Prevention Day' and make it a day to think about preparation for disaster prevention after next year 10/12, and I have also made an announcement.
I think I've become more aware of the possibility of unexpected things happening than ever before."

Since the test itself is almost finished, I just write a sentence, but please wait a little because we are also doing a further test whether the measurement is not wrong.

Be careful when buying second-hand housing!
What are the Pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) ・ Yahoo!News
● Newly established "Building Condition Survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Second-hand housing transactions are strong.
Prices for detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the Corona disaster has led to a rise in homeownership, the popularity of properties represented by soaring words such as "in front of, near, and directly connected to stations," "large scale," and "tower," has been concentrated, and the relatively inexpensive new properties have declined sharply.
[View image in this article] However, the share of existing (second-hand) housing distribution in Japan is still at a low level compared to overseas.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) partially revised the Residential Land and Building Transaction Business Act, and started a survey called the so・called inspection, a building situation survey for the purpose of transactions of safe and secure second-hand housing ( <url>).www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ).
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with housing checks the current state of the property, including deterioration, and the condition of the building, and presents it to the buyer after summarizing it in a report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting a property survey before a sale transaction, giving buyers a sense of security.
In turn, it also leads to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer side, it is a system that can grasp the condition of the second-hand housing that is to be purchased, and can purchase it with consent, and it is a system that has great merit at first glance.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative to investigate the situation of buildings.
In addition, I would like to note that only the notice of the inspection system became mandatory.
In other words, a real estate agent in charge of intermediation is obliged to explain that "at the time of real estate brokerage, we can introduce an architect who will investigate the situation of the building" or "we can not", but the implementation itself is not made compulsory.
● Risks to be feared by seller-led inspections On the other hand, similar systems are already in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.
In the pre-sale phase, buyers request a building survey from a specialist called an "inspector" or a "building surveyor".
For example, in the United States, inspections are carried out in 70-90% of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
The nature of the Japanese-style inspection is very different from that of the main "seller" in that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection.
The seller tries to show the condition of the building a little better, and sell it as high as possible and as fast as possible.
On the other hand, buyers want to examine the contents of the survey, make appropriate repairs, and live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap between the objectives and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as the risk of concern regarding the Japanese system.
● The scope of the survey for the seller-led inspection established by the state is limited to a minimum.
Because it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking a really important defect ● For an inspection company, an intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection will be conducted with a "degree" such as not reporting adverse findings to the seller

Anyway, it is important to have you deal with it properly depending on the psychiatry, and to leave a history of hospital visits (super important)

On the evidence of that... ... It is also unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia.
Here are some tips on Ginza that you will find interesting and want to talk to someone.
Go over Ginza! ?
First infiltrate into the Kin-za
As you walk through Ginza, you will find traces of the history that has been carved into Ginza, such as quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and many shrines.
When I was walking around Ginza with her, I suddenly came to the silence and said, "This was a peninsula in the past.
Ginza was once a peninsula?
Ginza in Chuo-ku, Tokyo is synonymous with the downtown area that created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan.
Ginza was originally a silver coin foundry, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shin Ryogeicho", but when it moved to Shokashicho, it came to be called "Ginza" by the common name.
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" that protrudes into the sea.
Before the Edo period, there was an inlet from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomae-shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now Ginza.
When Ieyasu TOKUGAWA established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and promoted the improvement of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu arranged the city blocks and made them go around the horiwari to develop the transportation of ships.
Then, they cut down the soil and Mt. Kanda, which had been shaved off the moat, and reclaimed the cove.
In front of Tiffany Ginza Main Store (Ginza 2-7, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument marking the birthplace of Ginza, which indicates the former Ginza Office.
"Pilgrimage to Sacred Places" in Ginza that people in the know know
The Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour, a pilgrimage to sacred places known to those in the know, is held every year in Ginza.
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most eye-catching one is the Kabuki Inari Shrine located in front of the Kabukiza.
Many people visit the shrine on the far right of Kabukiza before and after the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo" is on the Ginza terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
Hodo Inari-jinja Shrine, Azuma Inari-jinja Shrine and Toyoiwa Inari-jinja Shrine are located in the back of the alley, and it is hard to stand out, but Toyoiwa Inari-jinja Shrine is known for being revered by Kabuki actor Uzaemon Ichimura.The Seisei Inari-jinja Shrine at the entrance of Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour also includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines have Inari as their deities.
Inari-sha Shrine, where foxes greet you in front of the shrine building, was built as a blessing of "five grain bountiful harvest" where rice is well cultivated in places where there are many farmers.
As a result, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it is said that it is blessed with prosperity in business, and in Ginza, Japan's premier shopping district, faith spread.

Korea Posco International Acquires Senex Energy in Australia to Expand Overseas Gas Field Business = News from Korea (WoW!Korea ） - Yahoo!News
Posco International announced on June 12 that it has entered into an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy in Australia and Senex Energy in Australia.
Currently, procedures such as approval of the local subsidiary and approval at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy are still in the state, and the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in 3 months next year.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition amounted to KRW 770.9 billion, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9% respectively.
Posco International said it decided to acquire the company because it believed that demand for natural gas would continue to increase even in the energy transition period, and that blue hydrogen, the natural gas base, would divide the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
Posco International's acquisition will also secure 2019 natural gas reserves equivalent to 44% of South Korea's 8020 billion cubic feet (802BCF) of natural gas consumption, as well as onshore gas field operators in Australia.

The pain in the knee, maybe "osteoarthritis of the knee"! ?
Medical DOC (Medical DOC ) - Yahoo!News
Editorial: I have been suffering from knee pain lately.
What kind of disease is possible?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of pain in the knee joint can vary, including injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
The most common form of osteoarthritis in Japan is osteoarthritis.
Editorial: Do you mean the joints will deform?
Professor Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, and it is responsible for the work to relieve the impact and smooth the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, intense sports, etc., cartilage may be worn or distorted.
As a result, it leads to deformation and inflammation of the joint.
Editorial: Does osteoarthritis develop in addition to the knee?
Maruyama Sensei: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers and at the base of the hand, neck, waist, big toe, hip joint, etc.
However, the most common is the case that occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial: What kind of structure are joints in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: The joints are made up of 2 bones.
And the part where these 2 pieces face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped with "articular capsule".
Editorial: It's a complicated structure.
Professor Maruyama: That's right.
There is a tissue called synovial membrane in the inner layer of the joint capsule, and joint fluid is made.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and consists of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That's why people say, "Hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate is good for smooth knee movements."
Editorial: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it plays a role in preventing bone from colliding directly with bone.
So to speak, it is a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn or distorted, it will deform the joint or cause inflammation and cause pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It is a basic pajamas, but when the pajamas are washing, I come to sleep with jerseys and so on!
Can some people quit smoking even if they are a heavy smoker or can't quit?
That's right, there are 2 kinds.
I knew him very well, but I completely quit.
It is said that I quit as it is, and became somehow I should stop it.

3 Gambling and Games of the "Kaiji" series that you can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo!News
Gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasting explosive popularity mainly men.
1. One of the real pleasures of this game is the extreme game that puts life on the line.
I can't wait to see you again!!!!!!!!!!!... ... Challenge the steel frame crossing!
So this time, I want to verify the game of Kaiji that can be actually played or is practiced in the planning video.
■ Swamp It is a pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambling break record Kaiji".
In the original, at a high rate of 1 ball 4000 yen, Kaiji was startled.
In this "swamp", a large trap of "Nail forest", "mobile" and "3-stage croon" was set up, and capture was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of hands, and finally went out to the rough business of placing a vinyl tank in a building and sinking and tilting the ground, and captured brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "Ichidama 4000 yen", and the difficulty level is lowered, but you can taste the feeling of Kaiji.
■ Steel frame crossing It is a steel frame crossing of "human horse racing" that was carried out to debtors including Kaiji at the "Star Side party" held by rich people as a sideshow.
Debtors move forward while devising so as not to fall on the thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground, and compete for its speed.
There are 12 participants and the top 2 can win the prize, but there are only 4 steel frames, safety measures are insufficient, and the chances of dying are quite high.
This steel frame crossing is highly dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game, and you can experience very close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed in "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", the home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, a professional baseball team.
This Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and a steel bridge is out, and "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared ahead of it, and we go on foot.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi posted a video of himself walking the Eagle Bridge on YouTube, saying that "You can experience steel bridge crossing in Japan" and became a topic.
■ E-card Card game of 2 people match, "E-card".
1 emperor's card, 8 citizens' cards, 1 slave's card using a total of 10 cards, play divided into emperor side, slave side.
The game is very well made and has the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizen, the citizen is strong against the slave, and the slave is strong against the emperor.
Kaiji plays Tonegawa with a strict rule that "if you lose, you will be shaved off your ears" in the play.
In the end, Kaiji realized that a device that destroys the ear, such as an earphone attached to the ear, sensed and transmitted changes in pulse and body temperature, etc., and read psychology.He confused Tone River by cutting his own ear to the limit and making his body an outlier, and won.
E-cards are available on the market and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru has uploaded a video to compete with Fujiwara Tatsuya who played the role of Kaiji in the movie with an E-card, causing a topic.
■There is also a taste of Kaiji mood?
Everyone does not want to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read the manga, you will taste only the mood.
How about feeling that world view through the game?
One step to the New Year, gently boost the great ema of the tiger in the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine Yamagata Newspaper
In Yamagata City, where preparations are underway for the New Year, a large ema of the next year's zodiac sign, "Tora," appeared.
The students of Tohoku University of Art and Technology, who designed the design, visited the shrine on the 11th and held a proclamation festival in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has commissioned students of art and technology to paint the original ema.
This time, 9 people from the Nihonga course in the Art Department, led by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga, drew works by Yui Tsuchiya (3 years) (22).
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and the center is about 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya painted the image as if the cherry blossoms were gently pushing her back as she stepped into the new year.
The tiger stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms with the hope that "even in a rapidly changing world, we can afford to admire the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on ema (votive tablets) that are distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

"I want to continue to live in Tamano" Let's think about the proposal City 4 High School Workshop: Sanyo Shimbun Digital|-san Digital
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from 4 high schools in Tamano City are working on a workshop to think about "Tamano who wants to continue living" together.
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai・Zukuri Center, an intermediate support organization, we will make recommendations to the mayor and others by summarizing the voices of young people.
"When is it fun? ".
When asked by the facilitator, the students say, "When you get excited with a lot of people," or "when you are playing the drums."
The first time was held at Sunrise Fureai Kaikan on 11/13.
18 high school students and local people discussed the theme of "island" while moving in the "World Cafe" method, thinking about "interesting town", "livable town" and "town that feels worth living".
Each idea is written out on sticky notes, pasted on imitation paper and organized.
"A town with a lot of young people looks interesting," "Transportation such as trains and buses are indispensable for livability."
We will discuss further whether there is something in common.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is attractive," says Tamano, a 3rd grade student at Tamano High School of Commerce and Industry (18).
Binan High School 3rd grade student (18) said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but a place rich in nature is good," and by talking with adults, it seems that he noticed not only the problems of the region but also the charm.
The 12th of the 2nd month gathered only high school students and organized the contents of the proposal.
It is planned to announce it by inviting the mayor, the education chief and others in 2 months next year.
Rie Azuma, President of the center, said, "We hope to foster the love of local communities among high school students and to encourage young people to take the initiative in community development."

How to find the new winding of the stall (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
It is an indispensable stall in winter, but is there a time when the cloth clings to the neck?
It is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding it, but sometimes I hear a voice that I do not know the trick right now.
If you have a shawl that can be rolled quickly without the cloth holding it...When I was thinking, I found something novel.
The stall of the brand "COTTORI (KOTORI)" has a long side of about 1 meter, a feeling of size that is more compact than the general one.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Is it so short that it can be rolled?" 」
If you look closely, it is tailored to 1 piece by knitting a long and thin cut cloth, and the whole is a mesh of the net.
The mesh allows the ends of the stall to pass through.
So, without tying the ends, you can wind them and fasten them.
Very light and warm in fleece material.
Gilet (vest) with no sleeves is popular this year, but many people will wear it in combination with a stall so that the shoulder does not get cold.
I think that it is surely convenient to have such a stall.

the Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting.
it was directed by peter jackson called Get Buck.
It's fresh, it's life-size beatles, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh, it's fresh.……
it's just before the breakup, so i'm playing ghisghis, but it's not the dramatic ghisghis like i was imagining.
"I know I'm annoying, but come on!I can't wait to see you again. I can't wait to see you again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We don't hate each other so much as we fight like that, but there's a certain feeling in the air that "Well, it's impossible to work with us anymore", and the Beatles were like that, it's an interesting dismantling of legends or something.
And even in such an atmosphere, when you start playing, everyone is really full of talent
From a little phrase, each other says, "How about this?"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm sure I'm going to be able to do that.
In particular, the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
It's amazing that you can never see the process of composing like this
And it's natural, but everyone is getting fat, so you can be happy just by watching the performance scene
It seems that it is still 3 episodes in 1 episode, but it was the impression that the biggest cause of the dissolution was the environment around than the Beatles itself so far
The four of us are complaining about something, but if we start making songs, it'll be fun, but what about the place of the live?When it comes to talking, producers and people like publicity people say, "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!"It was easy to understand that I have already left the hands of the people who said it was like "Oh, it's like".
Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way.……
Also, paul seems to be supervising, so I thought that it might be because of that that there are many scenes where Paul is somewhat bad.

i can't.

I thought that I felt a sense of responsibility because I am a serious character and that it is no longer possible to have more and more room for my heart.
I think that it is difficult to live a little now.
I am from a sales job, but I was sick enough to die, and I changed jobs, but at that time I was not good at running sales activities from myself, but I thought that it was very suitable for sales activities that are needed by customers, so it became very easy to work if I chose such a job and changed jobs.
I was told that I could not do it, but I think that if I can find what I am good at and what I can do in myself, my future way of life will be somewhat easier.
まOf course I think that it is good to think about this after slowly resting and being able to relax in my heart.
However, I think that there is also daily life, so if you have a company's union, an industrial doctor, or a window where you can consult, there may be some kind of system if you consult there, so it seems that it is good to consult once.
It is good if you can live with a feeling of ease even a little in the future.

Tornadoes occur frequently in the United States, causing Major damage Due to unseasonably warm weather and strong cold Weather (Weather News ) - Yahoo!News
From Friday night on the 10th (Friday) to Saturday on the 11th (Saturday), there were many tornadoes mainly in the southern part of the United States.
It is thought that the atmosphere became very unstable due to the influence of strong cold air moving south to the place where it was record warm for this period, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the south of the United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
Houston, Texas, has highs of 9 (Thursday) and 10 (Friday) local time, reaching nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
At around 5500m above, strong cold air below -30°C moved south to the place where record warm weather had become such, so an active front was formed by a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It seems that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern part of the United States is an area prone to tornadoes, but it is a high season from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases where major damage occurs at this time.
The tornado alert issued in 1 day in winter reached nearly 150 times, a record number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 10 tornadoes and gusts in Friday alone, 400 local time.
According to this, we can see that there are 2 concentrated areas, roughly divided into the southern line from KY to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In KY, it is the EF scale (improved Fujita Scale) that indicates the strength of the tornado, reaching from the strong one of the 6 stages to the 3rd EF3, and it is thought that gusts of around 70 m/s blew instantly.
Depending on future research, it may be judged as EF4-5.
In Japan, based on the Improved Fujita Scale, JEF (Japanese version of the Improved Fujita Scale) is used to match the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, is enough to occur in Japan, and it is the level at which wooden houses collapse.

US tornado "Largest ever" Voice asking for help in live broadcast from under the rubble (Nikkan Sports ) - Yahoo!News
Regarding tornado damage in the Midwest and south of the United States, U.S. President Biden expressed a funny view on the 11th (12th Japan Time) as "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history 1".
CNN TV reported.
"As a federal government, we do everything we can," Biden said.
"We do not yet know how many lives were lost or the full extent of the damage," he said.
More than 100 people were feared dead.
Photo: Residents carrying household items from broken houses in tornado-damaged KY Between the night of the 10th and the early morning of the 11th, at least 6 tornadoes occurred in KY and more than 30 other states.
The tornado hit Missouri in 1925 with 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of damage, but CNN meteorologists estimated that it was the largest of its kind at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) this time.
In Mayfield, Ky, the candle factory, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for Christmas, was also severely damaged.
There were 110 people on duty at the time, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace.
In the dark, a woman who became immobile under the rubble, which is about 1-5 meters thick, felt the weight of rescuers searching over the rubble and asked for help on a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also echoed the screams and the "Happy Birthday to You" song, which another woman is believed to have sung while crying to drown her fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5・year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people likened it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrible sound like a ground echo that something spewed out," he recalled.
A Mayfield police officer said, "The search operation will continue until there is no need.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will be."
In Illinois, at least 6 people were confirmed dead after a warehouse at Amazon, an online shopping giant, collapsed.
The train derails due to the impact that the train's vehicle is cut off, and the highway is also blocked one after another due to the influence of the vehicle overturning.
According to US web media, about 13 million homes in Tennessee and about 40 million others have power outages.

There is a long-standing discourse that the way of thinking about the evaluation system of the star system is different.
While foreign countries will deduct points from there based on 5 stars, Japan claims to add points/deduct points from 3 stars as neutral.
There is already a difference of 2 stars at the time of the reference point, and 4 stars have a completely different meaning in "there is a point deduction element" and "It is not a masterpiece but a masterpiece".
If you use 5 stars as the standard, "works with no flaws" and "works with the highest standards in everything" will be in the same line, so if there is such a tendency, I think that it is a defect on the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but 3 stars (notoriety) because such an operation is actually made in such a system I want you to know that I'm not going to be able to do that.

<Sag eat a note> "Fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce" of "hakobune"暮Lifestyle・BunkaーSaga Newspaper NewsーSaga Newspaper Live
Lunch box "Fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and Fried shrimp homemade Tartar sauce"
Hakobune is a take-out specialty store with colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) made with plenty of vegetables.
Mr. and Mrs. Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Mr. Arimi (38) opened the restaurant on May 8 last year, "so that you can taste the restaurant feeling at home."
One of the popular bento menus is "Fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
The fish choose the good ones from time to time in the market.
Takayuki says, "The raw breadcrumbs are as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients."
There are 4 kinds of vegetables and deli to accompany the lunch, and there is rice with small grains and soup with Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture.
The vegetables are homemade in the buckwheat fields and purchased at direct sales offices in the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Mr. Takayuki is trained in French and adds color to the dishes such as lapés and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a blend of Japanese and Western flavors that a wide range of generations can enjoy, such as "the soothing taste that I am used to eating" (Arimi) like the rolled egg.
The bento "Tegone Hamburger with domestic Aibuki Meat" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, the company will also launch the Charcuterie Set, a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

There was something interesting at Haneda Airport that happened to stop by, so I tried using it
Ride comfort is not that bad, but sometimes it shakes (not so much as getting drunk)
speed, of course, slow.
Safety I think it is safe for the time being because there are people around and the speed is lowered, and in some cases it stops completely, but I thought it is dangerous depending on the place
It hurts my eyes around, it's good to be seen, but it hurts my heart to be seen with a feeling of "I'm in the way"
This is the best app I have ever used and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!
It is a pity that it will be easy to use if there are few people a little more or if there are considerations such as getting closer to the edge.
I thought that I should make a dedicated lane specifically so as not to get in the way of other people walking
However, I thought that it was a good ride if there were fewer people because it was relaxing and I could relax while looking at the scenery
I was excited by the near future feeling that such autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the surrounding gaze is comfortable, it was a difficult vehicle unless you have a fairly patient mind
damn it, i was embarrassed.

A Family's Long Road to Environmental Protection in China (JBPRESS) - Yahoo!News
(Isamu Kato, Corporate Consultant, Hong Kong Company Find Asia) With its vast land, China is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest mammal species and the 3rd largest plant species in the world.
Some municipalities recognize the value as biodiversity, and in addition to the environmental protection carried out by local governments, there are also areas that promote the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one of these regions.
Si Sapanna is located on the border with Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people, who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River flows through Southeast Asian countries.
Xishapanna-Tai (Xishuangbanna) The area of Xishapanna is only 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of wild animals and 20% of plants.
This time, we met Mr. Li Yong-kwok, who is an environmental protection activist in Sisapanna, and talked about the contents of the activities.
■ Started environmental protection activities with my German husband ― ― It has been 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li Our environmental protection activities "Tianyu" started in 2000.
It was my husband Josef Margraf who gave me the opportunity.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China and had some of the best biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
This is why large-scale logging of the rainforest has been carried out in the past to take root in the region and to produce rubber that was scarce in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And I met and married a reporter here.
- - Did you not have any interest in nature conservation before that?
Li: I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of rainforest or the meaning of biodiversity.
That's why I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Why do you think that I sometimes see people who have an aura even though their faces are not well-formed or special tall?
A popular actor once said, "I'm not going to do that."
The aura is not something that comes out thinking that it is going to come out.
It is something that comes out naturally at the moment when you have confidence in yourself.and.
I'm sure that person has a solid self-confidence in the inside.

I suddenly think, is it fine to say that the other person's clothes are home or color is good?
it's not detailed, is it?
i can see it.
I think that it is not fine.
I have never been told that it is fine to praise, so I do not know what to say a little.
I wonder if he praised me in detail.
what would you do if yokomine sakura confessed?
"I was confessed to Sakura-san, my heart is full of spring, please," I reply and go out with you.
And to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at the time I want to open it later?
If you open it at the same time, the procedure will be completed faster.
Now it will be completed in about 1 week.
Apart from that, there is no fee, so we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

【Omar Ring / Personal Reminder】 MOD has been the cause of CTD in its own environment, and it took about 1 month and a half to identify
Stable data until 3 month CTD due to multiple factors has occurred while not taking much time to play from around GW, and it took very long to identify with the feeling that it examined little by little only on holidays.
なんで.Net Did you not parse the log with the Script Framework (you'll know in a few minutes)?.Some of the dll series and mesh related errors do not remain in the crash log.
〇 Timing of the main CTD
* すべてパピルスや.Net Script Framework, leave a log of the type.The dll plug-ins logs leave no footprints.
* At the time of some NPC kill/ attack accumulation: Activate even with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree Mr. SE update resume version) Improved with OFF ※ There is a possibility of wet clothes about this?
* At the time of the camera work of the kill move activation for some NPCs → Kill move setting by PC is turned OFF.Basic improvements in OFF via ini: Configuration conflicts in DAR+Nemesis relationships?but let alone the limit, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000
* (Basic outdoor) While moving the field + Some magic (example: Frozen Rune) when activated, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID usage NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) All OFF, all improved by 5 consecutive attempts.
Is it due to some additional armor worn by actor/NPC or a shader misconfiguration in the body mesh?It should be noted that the 2.0 SPID uses default.ini is misformatted, but the result is the intended result, and the assumption Perk should have been applied to the NPC.
The first is a site attack or OnHit related motion/Combat MOD(.I put a wet coat on (the one of the dlls) and went to focus on the check, but the result was like this.
I don't think there was a similar bug report, at least at the English, German, or French level.
If there are people who have similar CTD problem in Japanese environment by any chance, I thought that it might be helpful as a reminder and I was allowed to post.
everyone is doing it with the mental of the last minute.、

What to think about the importance of psychiatric home care - When today's home care is over
Since I have bipolar disorder, I have been receiving home-visit nursing for a long time, but I think that I have been able to build a very good relationship with the nurse (woman) at the home-visit nursing station I am using now.
Every week, I talk about a lot of things.
Of course, they do what is necessary for drug administration (such as one package), but above all, for people with mental illness, I thought that with today's visit nursing care, how important is fun communication.
Today, I also discussed gender theory or chat about gender differences between men and women lol.
It's about the sexual desire of men and women, why she got divorced, is it okay to do such a thing in visiting nursing?I also talk like that.
Sometimes, but sometimes I'm dressed as a transvestite.
However, I heard from an acquaintance that in the case of a psychiatric hospital's home-visit nursing station, an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and does only administrative correspondence, or that an occupational therapist comes in home-visit nursing and instructs me from the top, such as "We are doing medical care".
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think he is a really good nurse who will face Frank on an equal footing with me with mental illness.
By the way, it is a beautiful woman lol.
Some people may be receiving psychiatric home-visit care, and some may be thinking about receiving it.
Home care is very helpful for people with mental illness.
Let's take it if the doctor approves it.
And let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I could not fit the warping by all means, and there was a place where I canceled the contract from here.
i'm sorry.
I know it's a fake warning, but I was scared to come out in English.
Why do they come out in English?
there are a few things that might be causing it, for example・・・
- I do not know what the person who made it is displayed in Japanese
- Bug in language judgment
- The setting of the browser is English priority

Korea's hydrogen technology patent, China's 5'1... "Delayed Implementation of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap " ( Joongang Ilbo ) - Yahoo!News
The South Korean government announced the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be deployed (accumulated), and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was 1 KRW 6000 (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, fuel cell vehicles in the 11 month standard this year are only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the promotion of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per 1 kilometer is 8400 won, which is not much different from the time the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the state of implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap by the government is well below the target value.
The National Federation of Economists (Zenkyo-ren) released the report "Current Status and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economy and Ecosystem" on June 12.
According to the report, most of the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States, Japan and other countries.
Carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), Kyocera (Japan) for platinum catalysts, and DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA) for membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in 6 countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% annually (since 2014).
Korea ranks 5th in the world in the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020).
However, Zenkyoren said, "In fact, 6 countries make up the majority of the world hydrogen market, which means that it is actually lower than the competition countries."
The patent ranking by country is in order of China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
In 2017, China overtook the United States to become No. 1, and the gap has widened since then.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in South Korea was 1,033, surpassing Japan (974) and ranked 4th, but at the level of China (4721) 22%.
Zenkyo・ren proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax credit for capital investment and research and development expenses."

The United States, the aid of weapons and ammunition arrived in Ukraine troops also engaged in training (CNN.co.jp Yahoo!News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported by June 12 that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid is worth a total of 6000 million dollars (about 68 billion yen), and at the beginning of the year the last equipment, including 4 radars, which identify the firing point of mortars, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to Pentagon press secretary Kirby, these assistance also included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile javelin.
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, which received the increase of the military force advancing around the border with Ukraine by the Russian army.
The United States has been wary of the Russian military's actions, and has been in talks with NATO members to develop countermeasures in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
Biden had approved the weapons aid on 9/1 this year, when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the US White House.
U.S. military support to Ukraine reached about 45,000 million dollars this year.
Since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, the total aid has totaled more than $2.5 billion.
The US Military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian Army.
Last month, the United States sent the Florida National Guard in accordance with a multilateral joint training program supported by Ukraine.
According to a Pentagon statement, the US Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in the training and advice of Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special Forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a confidential matter of operation.
Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but there was also a tense exchange in the Ukraine situation.
The United States is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The future of inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes gifts "forbidden" in life, Akira Amari, former tax chairman of the LDP direct hit!
"Weekly Diamond" 12/18 Issue No. 1 feature, "Talk with the family at the New Year's holiday!"
It is a gift and a rushing inheritance technique before life.
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax have progressed, the tax reform Outline for fiscal 2022 has been postponed, but in the near future there is a great possibility that gifts in life, which is the royal way of dealing with inheritance tax, will become "forbidden".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
With a direct hit to the former chairman of the LDP's tax code, Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques to make the best offer in time for the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Miyahara Keiaki)
● From wealthy families to urban office workers "forbidden" gifts in life "From the viewpoint of taxation with a more integrated view of inheritance tax and gift tax, we will proceed with a full―scale study toward the construction of a tax system that is neutral in the selection of the time of asset transfer" ...
The ruling party announced last year that the outline of the Tax reform for fiscal 2021 had a huge impact not only on the wealthy but also on the middle class.
This is because it means to change the rules of inheritance and to increase the inheritance tax by making the "gift in life", which is the royal way of dealing with inheritance tax, "forbidden".
The iron rule for tax-saving measures for inheritance tax, which is highly progressive, is to "reduce the taxable property."
The strongest trump card, the gift in life, has been widely used not only by wealthy families but also by office workers who have a home in the three major metropolitan areas, which generates a small amount of inheritance tax.
In such a situation, the discussion of "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" sprung up.
Although the fastest introduction had been concerned 12 month 10 day announcement of the 22 year tax reform outline was forfeited, " review the current inheritance settlement tax system and calendar year gift system ideal way " " Tax-free measures of gift tax, within the limit is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets in the family (...) will continue to review", such as more stepping This is the first time that the Japanese government has proposed a policy for integration with the Japanese government.
Akiaki Amari, the former chairman of the LDP's tax investigation Committee, said in an interview with the main section.
"It is most important to lose the advantages and disadvantages due to the time of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same no matter when you go.
We are currently doing a simulation of what problems will arise (through integration)."If the fastest revision is made, the remaining chances of giving gifts in life are 3 times left.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future, we will cut a big hurdle toward invalidating the gift in life as a tax-saving measure.
So, how will the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax be changed specifically?

[NFL] Team players who won 1 game pass 3 times, what was feeling how (BBM Sports ) - Yahoo!News
Jones threw only 3 passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number of passes in the NFL in the past 50 years since 1974, when the Bills scored 3 times in Week 2 against the New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bills had O.J. Simpson for the first time in history to exceed 2,000 yards a season in the previous season.J.There was a genius RB named Simpson.
The Bills overcame the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton.
The weather was the biggest reason the Patriots developed such an extreme offense this time around.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and in terms of latitude it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degrees Celsius, the wind of 18m gusts blew, and before the game there was a blizzard.
The Bills were only local and didn't change much of their play choices.
30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen passed for 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was never bad.
In the 10 offensive series, the red zone was invaded 4 times, and there was a scoring machine.
In particular, after the end of the 3Q, they continued to advance to the red zone 3 times.
However, only 3 points of FG1 times in that 3 times were taken.
Defense before the goal of the game final board.
The Bills scored 4 points in the third quarter and were penalized in the 3rd and 9th quarters and tied for 3rd and 14th.
18 yards to the goal.
In the 3rd & 14th, QB Allen flowed right out of the pocket, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defense.
He threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, ace WR Stephon Diggs, who was outside the right, ran the Sharo Cross and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to get into Allen's eyes.
On 4th & 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the left, but the pass failed when he was hit by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front of him.
Bryant had covered Bills WR Cole Beasley one・on-one, but when he saw Allen's move in the middle, he released Beasley and responded to the pass.
Allen missed 2 receivers and threw 2 passes in the end zone.
The 4th down pass might have been a decision, but the 3rd down didn't have to aim for a TD.
You can take the first down with 2 plays.
It was still before 2 minutes, so if it was 4th & short, Allen's ability to have his own run should have lived.
Make your hair shiny and shiny.

3 Items that tend to be Placed in the Kitchen for a Long Time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo!News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably not as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges breed a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (I still recommend sterilizing them in the microwave).
The German researchers who did the study recommend changing the sponge 1 degree every 1 week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture notes that cutting boards should be replaced when they begin to fray, scratch, or ditch.
This is because once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean and bacteria multiply.
If you're still ok, don't forget to disinfect 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water with a unscented liquid bleach often with a table spoon 1 tablespoon dissolved solution.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and put it for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or lightly with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or cracked tableware
It may be heart-wrenching to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface becomes a new hotbed of bacteria and bacteria.
In addition, it can also cause the lips to be cut off in the chipped area and the drink to spill.
Yes, it's a chance to buy your new favorite mug!

Even if I try to rewrite using flashbios thinking that the BIOS is corrupted, it does not end at all.
According to the MSI blog, it seems to end in about 5 minutes, but it does not end in 1 hour
The possible cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the one that uses it by converting the SD card.

It is embarrassing to have a brand product for some reason.
You can have it if it is inconspicuous, but you can not have it written as Lv with a monogram like Vuitton.
Why not?
I think that it is good to fit my own length.
By the way, I think it would be good if it was in Japan.
If it is Japan,.It can be.
It has nothing to do with gaijin wind.
You should have told me earlier, "Why are you calling me out?""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
so it doesn't matter if you're a foreigner?I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
i guess i'm not even dreaming that i'm uncomfortable with the probability that it's okay.
I was living overseas on the way, but the Japanese who went outside, including me, had misunderstood that there were some people who came because they hated the upper and lower Confucian conventions, and the tag was off or that I could say anything to the local people.
If you look like a Westerner, I think that you are doing so with a kind of indulgence or a friendly feeling without any offense.
If you are a friend of mine or a Westerner, you are calling me by the name below, but sometimes there is a moment where I am a little hesitant about which to do when speaking in Japanese.
well, if you're a friend, it's still good.
I guess it was just doing it purely normally, but if you neglect it, you might not be able to stop the exceptional treatment that it is because it is Gaijin, so you should say it now.
i'm in japan, so i didn't want you to talk to me by japanese rules.
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because I can treat younger and older people strangely not to slap them or treat them like Japanese.
Because Japanese people, regardless of their personality, look at those details (including me).

I only have the ability to understand English a little, so I judge only by the translated text.
The translated text feels a little uncomfortable with the sentence, but I think that it is a level that I know what I want to convey and there is no trouble for playing (I think that it is better to ask others just as I feel like this)
This level of translation is often seen in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, I feel that it is a person who has been translated well.
I think that if you are not a native Japanese, you can understand the differences in the fine nuances of Japanese even if you study for a long period of time.
I do not know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people do not feel uncomfortable, it seems to be good to look for someone else.

Consideration "Blade of Demon destruction" Training is the battle.
"Equal Exchange of Effort" is a human Hymn <Commemoration of the start of Anime "Yukaku Hen">(QJWEB Quick・Japan Web ) - Yahoo!News
In recent Shonen manga, "The Blade of Demon destruction" is particularly different in that "training is a lot".
It is generally accepted that there is no battle, and the training edition, which trains at dawn and dusk, is not popular with readers.
Even in "ONE PIECE" of the same jump manga, I had 2 years of training when the straw hat team was separated, but I should know from the fact that I drew only the touch and skipped the rest with dynamism.
Well, one of the charms of Wampi is the eccentricity of the migratory land, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
The main character of "The Blade of Demon Destruction", Charcoal Jiro's training, prostrate to Tomioka Yoshiaki who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko who tried to take his own life, "Do not let others hold the right to kill and rob!" ! It can be said that it started from what was said by volunteers.
I'm not going to be able to do that, I'm not going to be able to do that, I'm going to be able to do that, I'm going to be able to do that, I'm going to be able to do that, I'm going to be able to do that, I'm going to be able to do that.. ... 。
While saying so, I introduced Sakonji Rin TAKI, the "Ikute" who trains those who want to join the demon kill squad, to the kindness of volunteer courage (it is also a poor community who does not explain its intention).
As for the first contact between Charcoal Jiro and Scales Taki, when asked, "What will you do when your sister eats people?", Charcoal Jiro was stuck in the answer, saying "judgment is slow."
Even among the fans, it is a seemingly unreasonable exchange of narrative grass.
However, to take a sister who has become a demon, there is a possibility that the moment when such a judgment may come.
It can be said that it is an initiative to enter training from a mental attitude.
However, the scale waterfall that takes the amateur charcoal Jiro who has not yet trained to go to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is full of pitfalls, trebuchets, and traps on top of the thin air, and it is about to die before entering the training.
Still, it is barely a "hero correction" to sniff out the faint smell of a trap that was touched by a human hand with a sharp sense of smell, and to avoid it somehow.
Even so, "I don't suddenly have the physical ability to avoid it all of a sudden!" ! It would be the essence of demon destruction to have Charcoal Jiro say, "Demon destruction."
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening is only to be able to use the "power and skills that have been polished up until then" with their original potential.
"Equal exchange of Effort" is a human hymn different from a demon who can have the power of the paranormal without grounds, and it is a difficult rule consistent with this work.
is this old?
It is not a bed yet, but a way to sleep by laying a mat directly in the house, and sleeping with a mattress, comforter.
because the house is not an apartment.
i do that too.
If you use the room widely, it is better to sleep with a futon than a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Are you obsessed?
Are people who work as part-time and want to work full-time, and work with other stores?
No, I don't think so in particular.
In such a case, it does not fall into my "obsession".
I think that it is "gag-tsuki" to plan to get profit more than effort somehow with minimal effort.
Do you have any smoke-free outposts around the country now?

Samsung Electronics Korea establishes DX Division that integrates home appliances and mobile, "Emphasizing User Experience" (WoW!Korea ） - Yahoo!News
Following Samsung Electronics' integration of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, the company decided to name DX (Device Experience) and announced on June 12 that it would reflect this in its organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
Through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances, the purpose of strengthening the user experience (Experience) can be read.
Samsung Electronics said the DX division, which combines CE and IM divisions, will consist of divisions such as VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical devices, MX (Mobile Experience), and networks.
"The name change reflects the company's medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership," a Samsung Electronics official said.
He added that it underscores the willingness of consumers to easily enjoy optimized experiences through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communications equipment, as well as service solutions that reflect the needs of their customers.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the company's strategy to create synergies across organizational boundaries and build a foundation for differentiated products and services was also reflected in the name.
Through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council, Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

I want it to be a heavier and more rigid expression.
> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> The larva ambush with sand to catch prey at any time, showing only the disc-shaped head from the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
The larva ambush in the sand so that the prey can be caught at any time, and only the disc-shaped head peeps out of the sand.
I think that it should be.
what worries me is
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at Ant's point of view?
What is it?
When I translate armoured heads as disc-shaped heads, I think that the part "It is a behemoth wearing a helmet on the ant scale" disappears…
Aichi 24 car Crash trailer driver is careless without a disease (TV Asahi System (ANN )) - Yahoo!News
In the accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent for inspection did not have any chronic illness, and it was found that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, on National Route 41 in Komaki City, 24 cars including trucks and passenger cars collided, and 12 people were lightly injured.

Oginuma X's Kinniku Man Review [Manga Vol.4] ( Weekly Pre-NEWS ) - Yahoo!News
The 20th Superhuman Olympic Games, which began with volume 3, is completed with this volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which drew from the opening to the semi-final at once, it is full of new tricks because it focused only on one battle!
- "Kinniku Man" Volume 4 review posted by Name Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 of the 5 stars) -Superman Pro wrestling has already begun before the game!
In a word, this volume 4 is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the finals of the Golden Meat Man vs Robin Mask, but first of all, I want to keep in mind that it is not a volume that depicts only the matches on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, the battle between each other and the special training scene, it is difficult to go to the game as it has changed from before, but it is never boring.
This feeling in the work, where the tension that the War of the century finally begins gradually increases, surely leads to the rise of the reader's tension, and I am amazed that even this period is a really calculated production.
And one more mountain before the important final, not to be missed is the 3rd place decision match between Terry Man and Ramen Man.
In addition to the luxury as a match card, what I like is the ramen man behind the scenes before the game to the poster of Kinniku Man "From now on, it's my turn to aim!" ！ 」
And try to beat the chop.
However, the scene in which the Terry Man who happened to pass by takes the sword and stops it, silently glances at each other, and the place just breaks up just by that.
What is amazing about this is that both of them have already lost, and there is no chance to fight the Kinniku Man in this tournament anymore.
But there is such a person agony around the KINNIKU man.
If you show me this, I can't help but think about the future of success in the distant future!
As a cartoonist, I still feel keenly that this is what a character stands for!
Such a fight between the two ends without much effort, but the famous scene is the appeal of the ramen man's tears after the game.
"Don't rely only on the strength of God's luck!". ！ 」
It is a line that.
This is already a grand meta remark about the work itself, I think that readers have also felt that Kinniku Man has not lost because he is the main character after all, and has somehow won where it is not his ability.
But by letting the ramen man make this remark, the boiled egg teacher has stuck a nail that can not use its hand anymore ahead of himself.
In this sentence, the reader says, "Well, then, is it possible to defeat Robin by the power of the Flesh Man?"
how? 」
Another point of view from an artist's point of view is that this is the same line that Mr. Boiled Tamago, who makes his work, imposed on himself.
this was a great thing.
I think that is definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend held Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture ) ( FBC Fukui Broadcasting ) - Yahoo!News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is surrounded by gentle light.

A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there is such a place.
It was so beautiful and I was relieved."
The illumination is intended to feel healing while avoiding dense, it is lit from 12.25 pm to 5pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 8pm in what was planned for the first time.

Internet distribution, Agricultural and Livestock Products PR Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, broadcast from Yonezawa Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities in the Okitama region and JA, developed PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce", which sells products while distributing videos on the Internet.
Yamagata Ai no Busho-tai and others made remote appearances on the "National Collaboration MINATO Market TV", which was planned for the first time in Minato-ku, Tokyo, and delivered the charm of the region along with specialty products.
The opening of the store was decided by the "Okitama × Minato Port Opening Project", an initiative in collaboration between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, and was relayed from Satoyama Vision House in Nanbara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama sommelier", wears a shawl of Yonezawa woven brand "nitorito" and introduces the charm of the region surrounded by nature.
I also delivered a state of Imonikai with the Busho-tai of love.
At a studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo Tanpopo and youtubers with more than 30 million subscribers tasted Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, and Tsuya Hime.
When I told the audience about the deliciousness, they said, "The smell is transmitted even though it is delivered" and "The best sake with a lot of delicious things".

this morning's misfortune.…
The NAS PC is no longer powered onま
-What happened.
1. In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
This time the PC is energized.
2. When I returned to the room after a little bit, I noticed that there was a sound like a pink rotor from the PC and shut it down first.
At this point, I thought that the fan movement was only getting worse due to the room temperature drop (6°C).
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3. No startup.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is turned on and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I will not say yes or no.
I unplug the power plug and try it again, but it still sticks only for a moment.
4.Connect the motherboard to ATX20 pin and 4 pin only, remove other parts and try it without starting.
5. I suspect that the PSU may be the cause of the problem, because the PSU fans seem to have hit something before and there was a buzzing sound.
I will try to find the remaining ATX power supply later.
Maybe.

* Reverse net
I have never used it, but Sagawa seems to be completely free by cash on delivery shipping.
I would like to hear the reputation if there is a person who knows because I am going to try using it.
* Oversized garbage, etc. (surcharge), postscript > Collection box of local government (small appliances free)
* Sell used.
Postscript > Mercari, Hard Off

There was a broken printer, an old UPS, etc. that I did not pick up anywhere, and it got in the way.

I love this game so much I can't wait to play it again!!!!!!!!!!!
Please tell me if you know how much the coin is worth here.
Coins that are in circulation in foreign countries are not worth it.．．
In Japan, banknotes are exchanged, but coins are not exchanged
If it is a commemorative gold coin, there is also value because gold is included

She can't, but is she being discriminated against by her face?

Ryujin Nippon, for the first time in 29 years, 8 strong!Volleyball men's national team advance to final T Nakagakiuchi coach "It was a big goal"
I thought it was bad when I got the third set in referee Challenge x2, but I won the full set.

I want to plant a tree that will be blindfolded in the garden, but please tell me if there is a tree recommended.
As a hope, care is easy and evergreen trees, and the one that becomes fruit if possible is good.
Would you please take care of this for me?
To give fruit to Feijoa, it is better to plant other fruit trees such as olives, blueberries, plums, etc. near to give fruit.
How much do we have to save each other to live together?

I think it's ants.
