The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major customer so it's not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or instructions on what to include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes to watch, sometimes to help, sometimes to bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be child enough themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You are the best judge of whether this is right for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and watch him fall asleep for hours.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is the reason for the psychologist's statement.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is of course up to you;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title doesn't want to come to mind anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going into the enclosure of his big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who, before each suicide, is asked anonymously to go to the place of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, forcing them to confront their fears in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This facing of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight."
At the end, there's a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this plot or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password.
Have to contact my husband first.
But this can take time.
What steps do I have to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y.o., splinter under thumbnail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
We tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grip.
It didn't work out and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
Ever new Omicron cases are worrying politics and science in Great Britain.
By New Year's Day, all eligible adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the corona booster vaccinations than previously planned in view of rapidly increasing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why it is urgent to strengthen vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get a boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent off an application.
Today, the invitation to an interview arrived by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on the toes of any official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them are leaving.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Apparently, the chair had an unspecified defect when it was sold.
How else can such damage to the upholstery occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for some time.
14 days no longer.
So I always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for it.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I'm going to write about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just have to write something from the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not want to be helped or think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing about such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least they could rely on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our guts."
However, this did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was even more disappointing than the bare result was the manner of the performance.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-goal ratio was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in no less than 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife, and did not implement what we had trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His opposite number Sebastian Gleim had a completely different reaction: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people were there."
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever coached," Gleim praised.
While on Patrick's team, even the high achievers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants avoid a total debacle and still came up to eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for squabbling.
The giants will already welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7 p.m.), in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted them a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally contacted them six months ago.
Always like peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on tour with the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe had actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" in order to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates that have already been postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe enjoyed singing as a youngster.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair combed back tightly and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking musical landscape.
He has been on tour with the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It could be complemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it matches the colour scheme.
It still doesn't work I can only long for the cover page but can't turn it.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks, especially with the FDP in the Ampel coalition, about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the extension of the rent level.
I will speak to the Justice Secretary to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not ease up despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step of the payment.

This is an absolute outrage
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has brought numerous tornadoes across the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 dead.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a swath of devastation about 200 miles (320 kilometers) long, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Homes, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers are rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# showcase is sold out.
That is a great pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been removed from the range altogether?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
when will you be in touch?
If delivery can't be made to my home, I'll have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form and wanted to check whether it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have themselves taken the initiative and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
In this way, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - based on the German model - is also intended to increase willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
He has moved to a company about which he has railed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, never mind.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Say hello to Boron!
I am currently leading the adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big picture is drawn, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and I'm already tripping over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further plot is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero and luring him into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Party size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they do not notice, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow path and flank the wagon, armed with three bows on the left and three on the right, while two stop the wagon with spears.
If there is a battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and are then found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find the deus ex machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back.
If you can send the return labels, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to give myself a little breathing space with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 preview on time.
Admittedly, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in F1, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher were again ignorant of the rules, as neither of them knew that you are allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, the two only came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on the subject to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
In my opinion, you should simply know such elementary rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' contrived commentary style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there is constant silliness, which makes both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the elimination round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV, since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the training sessions than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
Unironically, with the exception of advertising, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifter.
We offer this series in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, they can be used to operate entire plants.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, but depending on the model, fan pumps are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, shell or similar would have to be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction, ensuring low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet tube or similar by means of a 4/6 mm air hose...and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from flowing backwards once it leaves the basin and passes through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even though we indicate the processing time here on ebay as 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is upset just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course, corona does not stop here.
Please do not give a bad rating just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they are having a hard time
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Is it possible to order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly-crowned astronauts on their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they travelled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honour of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometres
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and many other experts consider 100 kilometres above the earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned space trip: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was attended by the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to the climate.
At the touch of a button, you can easily select whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to change colour, the beacon retains one light colour for around one minute, before gently changing to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" luminaire proves itself outdoors all year round.
In a snowy environment, their light is even particularly good - only a shortened lighting time is to be expected as soon as the days get shorter.
In winter, just make sure that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the standard Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery via our webshop and thus extend the service life of your decorative lamp even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I actually find the subject itself quite exciting and I don't mind standing in the lab (I've already done the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but at the time I also thought that I definitely wanted to and would study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I am having doubts, and I am particularly worried about my job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear again and again about great career opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
So I would be really interested to know:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking about possibly abandoning my studies in 2022 and training to be an IT specialist.
If you have any experience, please write to me:)
Extra stress before holidays & bank holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm only posting about it now.
It is not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, that there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which we in Switzerland call "Auffahrt."
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week we had a long 4-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loads of emails that absolutely had to get out before the driveway, an order here, an order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week" sounds like such a long time and it shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
On Wednesday, I was not only stressed, but also very annoyed.
What's with this self-imposed holiday?
Why do we even have holidays if we can't treat ourselves to them?!
Mind you, the stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all in such a state of mind independently.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you also know this in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she doesn't have any presents yet.
"The nice thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer to Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking and making cookies with her son.
"I love it," Catterfeld said.
However, she still has a lot to do before the reflective days: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and re-growth of plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage that occurs in poultry farming is exclusively due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers consist of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
GDR handmade model of the old E-Lok E 95.03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayman ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts, see photos, good function, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this line.
The required maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1"Co+Co1" locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95.01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Dessau Reichsbahn repair shop, the suitability of all six locomotives for refurbishment was determined.
[4] As the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95.01 to E 95.03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were built first.
It was only when it became clear that the number of E 94s to be refurbished could not be increased further that the E 95s became the focus of the refurbishment.
[4]The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They arrived at the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate rotation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be a problem.
As a result, it often happened that contactors got stuck during gear changes.
Then Beimann, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the contactor during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the split classes, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one at a time, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab, would have posed a problem in train operation.
[5] After the E 95.02 and E 95.03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the last to follow was the E 95.01, which was withdrawn from service on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255,001 was therefore never used.
All the locomotives were dismantled except for E 95.02.
The E 95.02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77.10 as a switch heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The interior of the locomotive was completed in 1986.
The locomotive is cared for as a museum piece in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on restoring the locomotive to working order.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to form the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to carry out optical rework on the locomotive by hand, dusty, with traces of play, cellar smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is supported by two feet..unfortunately, they are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't make the bed.
The central beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The central beam does not fit into the provided bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent?
no, not flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfil their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two people slightly injured and extensive damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not immediately known, but the police did not assume that the fire had been deliberately set.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend had prompted him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I wasn't vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused, because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust."
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without power
The lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and, in many cases, probably no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours after a fire caused serious damage to a substation.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The utility thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz installers were initially only able to put some lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30pm.
Since 11.15 p.m., those last affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood help.
"What is important now is that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhoods and inform the local fire stations if help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# bedspread in teal.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it on the table top.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, as it is not fit for purpose.
I would appreciate feedback
yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
will you send me the return form by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before buying it.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We disagree with that.
Nordic combined: Combined skier Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to concede defeat to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Returning the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both updated and are using version 4.5...
it could be that they have heard about problems before
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it.
As soon as I try to open it, I get the message, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupt contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?

I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components of dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic shades and metallic colors come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly streaks of metal when mixed with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models look true to the original thanks to the decals.
From national emblems on aircraft and ship names to trims and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Place the decals in the correct order while the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or glued more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each decal you need individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly wet the back of them with water until the backing paper darkens from the wetness.
Then you slide the image just a small piece of the paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull away the backing paper from the side.
Caution: Always check that the picture fits properly before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, crease or even tear.
Siphon off excess water with a household towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I read.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages
ok, thanks anyway!
then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned.
But will I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, but now, when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance company, they are suddenly at loggerheads.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and got the approval over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are charged to the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
All right.
We won't be ordering from them again.
When they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they've obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund had been initiated and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back.
I can't help it if the chest of drawers arrives at my door in a state of complete confusion
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't be doing that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until several months later.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Irrespective of this, the warranty period is 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find these with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films on the web, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you maybe not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to know the best price for the Odelle grey leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Sincerely,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I soon give up again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello,
"Half a victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelische Pressedienst (epd).
The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher from the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not backing down, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"Apparently, it cannot assert itself when a member state sets its mind on doing its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to information from Poland's border guard, meanwhile, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested in the night of Sunday and brought back to the border.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, who is in power in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response is putting pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly allow thousands of people to pass through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race, in the opinion of Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car period, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car period, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check that.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day
Europa-Park, the namesake of Sport-Club Freiburg's Europa-Park stadium, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters glowed red and white that day because of the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park once again showed how well suited the partnership is.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not €1699 as originally?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 world champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.
The Dutchman wins his first world championship title with Red Bull in his seventh year in Formula 1.
His path to the top of the premier class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the World Kart Championship after a crash in Sarno.
His father Jos Verstappen leaves him angry at a petrol station on the way back.
His mother, Sophie Kumpen, collects the teenager in the following car.
2014, England: Red Bull's junior team gets a promising youngster in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old is thus following in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
He will continue to race in European Formula 3 for the time being.
2015, Australia: At the age of 17 years and 166 days, Verstappen is the youngest driver in history to start a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he has to park his Toro Rosso prematurely in Melbourne.
2015, Malaysia: At 17 years and 180 days, the then Toro Rosso driver Verstappen is also the youngest racer to score points in Formula 1.
Verstappen finishes seventh at the Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen is an immediate winner.
At the age of 18 years and 228 days, he sensationally becomes the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his pole debut in Budapest - he's not the youngest.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for the return of an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your inane chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all from our budget.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had a chat yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
I want to bring the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bit / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
There is practically no audible difference to the original.
A Class-D audio amplifier with up to 3W output power drives the speakers, which are allowed to have an impedance of between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All individual sounds can be individually adjusted in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the model-accurate simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither will admit it to their i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, wow, then you're not to be taken as seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
For my part, a God set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is bunk.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be placed as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier practically free of distortion and color errors right up to the edge zone.
Magnifying glasses are often labelled with their magnification.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to get the most out of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
When used under optimal conditions - with the magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many a curious situation when selling fir trees.
On one occasion, a man even drove home without his partner because the two couldn't come to an agreement.
Every year, he plants a good 2,000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
This always makes the run-up to Christmas a bit fun, he says.
And with the voucher??
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and have now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to get into a debate about which is the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat grilled on a rotating spit.
And that's how they got their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly, except for a few failures.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and this also arrives at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were also similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over power lines with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've created an account here.
That's why I would appreciate an answer all the more.
When it's time to switch current accounts
Anyone who would have thought that there would be a lull in the current accounts would have been mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to use all kinds of tricks to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, has long been considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has just halved the allowance and even quartered the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank group division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight deposits.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers."
Commerzbank had already previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court even got right against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is a roller coaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still go out to her in equal measure is nothing short of a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and is still looking for love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Undignified end to a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight bump in the road, Raikkonen had to park his Alfa Romeo less than half way through the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in motorsport's premier class.
His wife Minttu and their two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 world championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsled - Sports
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 successes is the bobsleigh pilot's goal.
"I've worked it out, I would have to score nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he first fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he moved from third to first.
He then made some changes to the set-up of the material and gained a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the Briton Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier was third.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also claimed his 22nd victory in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after second place previously.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way, too," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
On the women's side, Laura Nolte claimed her third win of the season in the two-woman bobsleigh on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the previous day, she raced to World Cup victory with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple success on Sunday.
Olympic two-woman bobsleigh champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium place this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there is also an enormous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely faultless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it says it has expired, which makes me very angry.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order again as it's just reduced:)
Why is shipping only starting on 16 March?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message
It was accepted by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write about and maybe one or two others feel the same way...
I'm 24, have cPTBS, full-time student and dog mum - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually my child 1 to 1.
My boyfriend (we've been together since we were 6) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is bandaged due to burns).
On top of that, he has a cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2x a week), which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mum, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we will of course divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well controlled, I am reasonably well treated and I am coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and almost symptom-free.
My university is very demanding right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what happens then is on my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need those mental cues, because otherwise I don't cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm eternally grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't put it into words how grateful I am.
Don't know if I would have survived my cptbs otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would certainly find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately it's a completely different colour, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
On the first delivery, the colour was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In other words, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Let's try something completely different: Back in school, I noticed that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was brought up as a Christian and I've always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional life and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope you question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write in English, I understand it well
That was a long time ago, so I would refrain from
It's fine, thanks.
I expect feedback in a timely manner, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and an action ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
I think the passage is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If it means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive:D
Just relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
It's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he or she is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten itself out from the belly?
Or does it lie face-first directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was normal to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet cannot be used in this way at the moment.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it is simply the case that the politics of this broadcaster is now in the gutter.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It said it was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "We don't want to be a running advertising column."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising channel trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How can you be happy with all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I would like a call back, as my wooden table was delivered defective.
Broken body due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for a stomachache or just for cuddling - My Little Warmth Friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it in measured doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odours, stick or burn marks and dispose of them immediately if they are present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover beforehand to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-ups, a slight moisture build-up may occur on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions for use allow the heating of grain products.
After placing the warmed inner pillow back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are leaking, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the bottom of the table.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt even under their third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480,20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought it new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough to operate it.
No, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Are you full of ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop while it is connected to the mains?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG# delivered to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
With a capacity of 20 litres, it can also swallow larger photographic equipment without any problems, which can be stowed safely using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior, everything else you need in terms of everyday objects remains well organized and can be separated from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photographic equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: the first is the conventional way, via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchoring bars, firmly riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional top-access backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail enormously increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photographic equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you are going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the
It was announced that the shipping company would be in touch to collect the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it possible to predict when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Have a nice evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order immediately, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I couldn't have guessed that last year would turn out differently than I thought, and I wasn't able to redeem and clear it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which, with the balancing of the pane, adapts to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River spotted glowing boulders in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth and fame in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to budget your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The tout rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the telltale has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players have to defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I use the shipping method, consignment (filmed games) up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, it's usually DPD insured and with tracking (filmed games, wrapped in fleece and wrapping paper).
If you are a collector, then for an extra charge of 2 euros I can also send a box in a box, which is 100% free of pressure points.
"Why children are not bullies" documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it straight away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce parenting debate.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his or her development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of mandatory testing for those who have been vaccinated three times
The health ministers of the federal states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the obligation to test for those who have been vaccinated three times.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the obligation to be tested can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, told the "Bild am Sonntag."
The elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on this as early as next Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchase via the #PRS_ORG# page on your computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you are describing is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perception under general anaesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, less common is seeing images and rarest of all is the perception of pain.
Relevant to this topic: caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anaesthetic is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned at the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but by definition, ** u/Nitemarex **did not have any.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ don't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again whether you will at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email, which you did not answer.
Again, the question.
It says in the order and on the invoice that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
won't they call me?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental history of the theatre.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older."
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I am here to give thanks for my life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is Euro pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used as load carriers, especially in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria each year is not recorded.
New York wins first MLS championship
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Roulette Tips & Tricks
A week ago, I got lots of great tips for the perfect goulash here.
We had this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that:)
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens now?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can do it
IIt's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where to find Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, the goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where to get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in terms of "gain" and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to create a power reserve when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when shooting directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favourite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footswitch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen that with others.
Is there a way to return the lamp?
Because it hangs too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and it was not worth the wait
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iran, progress is being made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement were resumed after an interruption of almost one week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
It is the only federal state with a value above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state with a corona incidence above 1,000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and can hardly keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is an outrage in my eyes.
It's time for change
Happy anniversary to me, I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post office here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We have entered a winter freeze and have extended the summer slump to several months.
#What is the problem?
Yes, what was the point?
For the most part, this is likely to be simply related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we are generally performing.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many here are still really keen on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked which one would like to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, which became aware of this project in the last few days and found a pile of shards, to put it simply.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found each other who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not a bad thing, we have Discord for that in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which will still be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/chunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I picked up the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the #PRS_ORG# bedspread, is it also available in a larger size, 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pick-up time.
Are there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself once lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
Namely, that for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was displeasure on her part, she then defended vegetarianism and said that she knew where her meat came from and that being a vegetarian reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without which you would not bother.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be there on the allocated date for #PRS_ORG# to collect my return.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, that can't be changed, unfortunately.
Can I be given an alternative pick-up time?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented Mayor Peter Labonte with a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected that the number of visitors will continue to rise: the boom in hotel cruises on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
Followed their recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's that then.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar job, that is, we were also bearers of arms in the executive branch, I don't want to go any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplistic.
Basically, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, of course, even in a special uniform and weapon carrier, people on the right of conservative magically attract, that these people can then, of course, deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because of course, in addition to the average white person, you now have many Germans with an immigrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gays, because there are rather few to none of these in the executive branch, but completely normal men and women who you do not notice if they do not tell you) and I can and must rely on these people, because in case of doubt, they will save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds funny at first, in my experience these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked on by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to please them, while they just want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right-wingers, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinions there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing like-minded people meet and have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally enmeshed, and that's a good thing in my opinion, that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, which I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# earlier.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros in black or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the piece of wood are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Neater because of a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been concerned about something for some time.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I've had a hard time keeping my house clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything gets left behind, and every now and then it catches up with me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's never the case that "someone might spontaneously come to visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere, but most of the time, housework simply loses out to work and displeasure.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been on my mind for some time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as there are no visitors and, for example, there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a greater incentive or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.

A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I trained in software development and have been out of training for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am becoming increasingly aware that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work for some time.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (ASPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people in a matter-of-fact way, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem aloof (although I think that has improved).
Can I become a social worker this way?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete everyday working life is really as I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("already messed up the simplest things again") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I really should know how to do this myself by now"/"I keep him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm poor" etc.).
I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
But have you received the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation of that.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment
What do they mean by give back, please!
When I download a book on #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the food in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and uses these to build up its own proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the re-formation of feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand on the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may disrupt the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe damage to the plumage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the beginning of the regrowth of the plumage is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the re-growth of the plumage is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place away from direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and with pictures attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So I filed a complaint with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
Which were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you verify this?

Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for furthering your career
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I digress here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm currently refereeing as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't name anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up in teaching and I was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I've now arrived at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
The times before, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time over the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's the holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my day off was my day off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures, which also annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and, from the outside, the ref is also doing well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it isn't already.
I wonder if I want to be like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work somewhat boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if, in a year's time, I won't have ended up in the same place as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You realise it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas as to how I can get out of this situation where I'm completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this ingenious circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual plane until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string tension as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power amplifier that determines the tube character of an amplifier and used this finding to develop the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behaviour, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
Of course, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with one attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an ideal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the as yet unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernandez Zapata, told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees, has destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a combined size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
Particularly hard hit was the banana industry, which is immensely important for the island, and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and children in particular can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling excitement, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the gesture of gift-giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peacemaking "social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas holidays with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were given in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from another life of sin.
This unconventional form of gift-giving gave rise to the popular German custom of filling children's boots with presents.
Protestants objected to this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, only a few are annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the custom of Martin with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in Boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy cuddle over the question of who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost gained some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near royal palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man with a gun walking into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
which ones?

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow with color inside.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is a deliberate choice: by day, this modern light object looks like a naturally shaped large pebble.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: as a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" requires neither a supply line nor batteries.
Place the "beacon" in any place exposed to the sun during the day.
Two included spikes provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you can choose the colour yourself: six attractive light colours are available to you - in addition to daylight white.
It also switches off automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this several times and it doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will no longer order on principle.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 has once again been fundamentally improved.
A variably adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation, especially for bell armature motors - the typical "humming" is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the decoder to be automatically calibrated to the motor.
With up to 1.5A motor current, the LokSound 5 decoder provides enough juice even for older motors.

The pill problem
Hello dear womenfolk,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, this is actually my first post after a year on reddit.
As for my problem: I started taking the pill again out of necessity about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pain and shitty pre-period PMS.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses, which I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, I went from 0 to 100 and explosively got pimples and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it put a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel well.
During the two-year break, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and free of gunk, but maybe there's something someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist didn't take me that seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still to come.
Many thanks to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-pubescent bad eczema, then a period of rest, then extensive nodular lichen and the acne issue.
I tried everything in the way of nutrition, even in the course of chronic illness, and I got stuck on a sugar, milk and low-meat diet, because nothing else worked really well.
It may well be that Hormonell just has the worm in it, but if, like me, you have construction sites everywhere, you don't want to go looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina and the like.
Wrote and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my query.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what's there to check, if the money was there I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but it is generally available in large
since it is available in black large

In the name of the people: Lay people make judgments with
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothes.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they are not wearing robes: lay judges determine with professional judges whether and for how long someone will go behind bars.
Two of them talk to "Oeffentliche" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John-F.-Kennedy-Strasse.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into my customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the above e-mail address?
Can we dispose of the material of the packaging?
We don't have the means to keep them that long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were our own.
I had already ordered the same armchair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I would now have one in grey.
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for collection and refund?
and when would the pick-up be?
New 110 kV underground cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to an overhead line mast near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue request number: #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "delivery not possible."
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what happens next?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained that several times yesterday!!
It's a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides are cracked, so there's glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment because of #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be collected, because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all the books, that's why I asked #PRS_ORG#, as it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EC)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been at the Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently having a lot of trouble planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment, it just takes me a long time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and for me, each hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest an excessive amount of time even for simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start with the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build on it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
Retailers fear for their Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered are allowed to enter.
Retailers consider this to be unnecessary and complain of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Retail Federation (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth criticised the slump in sales of non-daily consumer goods.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off their Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
According to this, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director.
"2G for shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The wristband regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores that day with the received band.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in the retail trade - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, and revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche."
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made to find solutions for the centers and to get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was tried to be covered up with a yellow filler.
That doesn't look good.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and taped it up.
How do I proceed with the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to brightness adjustment, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working on a film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To carry out the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and that's it.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when it is switched on again - very handy for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality stems from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right one on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply unit.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can connect directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
It's great that a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small: (
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-laden comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, who have been winless twice in a row recently, seemed to be on their way to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE picked themselves up, shook off the frustration of a mixed start to the season in the space of just over an hour and stormed to a 5-2 victory. "It's amazing what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and heaped "total praise on every single person who was there."
At the beginning, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which is now in ninth place and still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasised the morale of his team-mates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and, looking at the result, he was particularly pleased for the spectators.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself as well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional life.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (18:30, Sky).
I just received the mail that my package will be returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get it redirected, no chance.
Can it be re-sent directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Unfortunately, for me, that would mean that I would not order again, because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampener for women's handball ahead of quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the pitch with hanging heads and blank stares after the humiliation against Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
Of all of them, that was a bad game that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, the 2019 World Championship runner-up will have to improve significantly next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence," conceded backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not up to scratch from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at kick-off.
Missed throws and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with some saves.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
The German women were hardly able to stand up to the aggressive defense of the Danes - and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
At 3:10 after 20 minutes, the game was over early, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she will be allowed to participate again in the quarter-finals.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection came into the game a little better and came close to at least five goals by the break.
The already faint hope of catching up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-rested opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to improve its performance and left the floor as a clear loser.

The title implies that I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely completed, I will then continue my work, in part, in vaccination centres.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
My area of responsibility includes the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have anyone with us, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, caused a lot of thought in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern."
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "person who is nervous."
And also no one "who has to do everything quickly."
People heard from the TV presenter that this was completely untrue.
To which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably caused astonishment among many people from the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the comment that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern."
As a result, an educational gap was closed - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected it to the PC, synchronized it and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for racing bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least some training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
Said and done, I set off on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then happened what lurks in every city centre (this time: thank you Krefeld!).
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to go the rest of the way.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a rather bad mood and take the first possible train home.
Then it wasn't so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike ride.
But now I'm faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would be very reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't bad, since there were also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, ripped off 120km on the day I came to pick up the bike until 2 pm!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he had been rolling with them for several years.
But when I think about the fact that I still have to change a tyre after 80-90kms, I think I'm in a really bad mood:D
Now I got into a conversation with an elderly man on the platform, who asked me in bewilderment why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these are supposed to be non-flat.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't want to spend 40€/tire, only to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I currently have 25x622 on the road bike, I think.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tyres for a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to my absolute! lay knowledge rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car slams into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with a median strip on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for an unknown reason and then hit the oncoming traffic, the police announced.
There, there was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wide-band B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, an appropriately designed foot is directly included in this construction proposal to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably grown-up and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in the treble.
This is generally the case with widebands in order to optimize the excessive frequency clustering.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced, creating a warmer sound.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which can be used as a reference, create an enemy dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the enclosures, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate place in order to be able to pass the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer."
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, lid, front and base are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, it is easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the enclosure has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back panel.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening, where it protrudes by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out there loosely.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions crossover Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher level of planning and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per channel, so we will watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - still, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get your drinks chilled, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
