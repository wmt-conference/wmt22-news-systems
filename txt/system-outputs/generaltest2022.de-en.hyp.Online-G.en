The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should enclose the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as you can still be a child yourself, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it is OK for him, that's good.
You can decide for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
After all, it's not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to mind anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the wlan available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that may take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y., Splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, has splinters of wood under the thumb nail (outside) along the entire length.
Have tried to pull him with tweezers.
Very difficult to grab.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speeds are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital control panel.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable control panels.
There are auxiliary registers for central stations that can only program the CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speeds at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows an automatic login to mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC tracks.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
More and more new Omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer by the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing omikron numbers than previously sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was the end of January.
The UK government will also provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, an emergency is faced, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let yourself be boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am for everyone to introduce themselves with pronouns
I have sent out an application.
Today the invitation for a conversation came by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step over the feet of an official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one that I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious defect when sold.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since ca.
14 Days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6#PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
[CW] That feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something a little detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something from my soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we could not help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing distance, I can not reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... i know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: what is the series good for "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with the review of the Cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
However, it did not settle down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
And even more than the naked result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
Let me mention a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: the three-way rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) on a whopping 31 attempts - any more questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained".
Namely to move the ball.
His opposite Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," Gleim added.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed down the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the Giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already fallen behind 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for quarreling.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
we used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Always as if peeled from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" in order to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances scheduled during the Advent season also have to be cancelled first, as it is on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de ) is called.
From January, the artists will then want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe liked to sing a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of comedian harmonists.
He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women it's no problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair combed back strictly and with etiquette in mind, Max Raabe has become an indispensable part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation will not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
Numerous tornadoes have passed through the United States during a devastating storm system.
There could be more than 100 deaths in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the United States and possibly caused up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long swath of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that wherever the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just get away.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky alone, the official figures are increasing every hour.
Hello, I just saw that your showcase #NAME# is sold out.
This is a great pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
when will you be in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item or given a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to the German model - should also increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company that he was complaining about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't think you were good at that time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't think his job was good either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with your first own campaign
Welcome to Boron!
I am currently leading the adventure over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specially written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been thought up and now I am about to write the entry-level adventure and stumble over my own feet already on the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further plot should develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is supposed to lie in wait for a group of goblins and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they don't notice, the goblins lurk the hero in a hollow path and flank the carriage armed with three bows each on the left and right, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If there is a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put them back together.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
Can you then leave the return receipts to come, then I can pack the lamp and take it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to give myself a little air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was canceled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the start accident, but you would still have had the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) can still show.
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwarties has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was a lack of knowledge of the rules in F1 again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen should be allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
On Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork, what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I do not like the contrived comment style of Roos, but I admit that this is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silly things that make both of them seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of restlessness in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the run-off round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very meager and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel broadcasting F1.
With the exception of advertising, RTL is doing a better job with the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Click here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several vents.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model, fan pumps are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to call.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an air outlet or the like...and off we go.
The fan pump should be the same as or higher than the water level and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a check valve between them.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve between them.
This would prevent water from running backwards once the water from the basin passes through the pump...
If the fan pump should be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, we pack every day and the packages are also picked up here every day.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding business...of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
One of course likes to scold about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it fucking hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrest?
Can you also order the legs in hell here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly crowned astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, said as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a Nasa astronaut in 1961, after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for each ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
The 74-year-old said with a laugh that she was just flying along.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The missile system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object slowed down by large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the border with outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-outing of Blue Origin: at the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the push of a button, you can easily select whether your "Smart Stone" should shine permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone retains a light color for about a minute, before it smoothly transitions to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" luminaire proves its worth outdoors all year round.
In a snowy environment, their light is even particularly good – only a shorter lighting time is to be expected as soon as the days are shorter.
In winter, please only make sure that no snow impairs the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMH battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and even standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely want to and will study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the career prospects are depressing me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly low-paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really unsure at the moment and am considering possibly canceling my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience, feel free to write it :)
Extra stress before Holidays & Bank Holiday Weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, only now a post to it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, it's also available before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to get out before the driveway, order here Order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that should not be?
Or because, in all seriousness, people want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very nervous.
What is this self-flagellation for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can't really treat ourselves to them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent on it.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, " the actress and singer told Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the party by baking and making cookies with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of moulting and new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the plumage damage that occurs in bird husbandry is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to a lack or unbalanced protein intake and /or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
GDR-handcrafted model old building E-Locomotive E 95 03 DRG / DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, Function well, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was used for traction heavier Coal trains have been designed in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have refurbished it operationally
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km / h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km / h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1’ Co+Co1’ locomotive with a paw bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair plant in Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger quantities, were preferably constructed first.
Only when it was clear from the E 94 that the work-up number could not be increased further, did the E 95 come into the focus of the work-up.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway Depot.
They came to the Halle P Railway Works in 1960.
In a separate circulation plan, they were mostly used before coal trains from the Geisel Valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it often happened that contactors stuck during switching actions.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to loosen the contactors again with a hammer and a wooden wedge while driving.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most types of splinters, so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to fill electric locomotives with one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were last followed by the E 95 01, which ceased service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a switch heating system at Halle Central Station as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It still took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
in 1979, the first external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed internally in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is looked after museal.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to the Central German network in Leipzig.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function well, it is necessary to do visual rework on the locomotive in own work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes the F-parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam can not be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
i can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent?
no no flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reported to have been taken to hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume that the fire was intentional.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it will arrive much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet commented publicly on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, " Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors".
So far, he has refused to do so, because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust".
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says that he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been removed - and the BioNTech BOSS has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had crippled a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale malfunction could finally be completely fixed late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts,"said Florian Witt, Head of the Primary Technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Western network installers were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 19.15 on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Complex cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 18 o'clock, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30 Clock.
Since 23.15, the last ones affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood help after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire brigade houses if help is needed," said District administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the main focus was on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?

I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this

I also have to work in between!
In order for the paint application to be uniform and clean, you should clean the components of dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clean water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlapping of the layers of paint will later ensure a uniform surface.
Avoid quick swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there may be unattractive metal streaks when they mix with ordinary paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve a true-to-the-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trim strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or glued more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each needed decal individually and arrange them for you.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisten their back side with water for a short time until the backing paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then you just push the picture a small piece of paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, creases or even tears.
Siphon off excess water with a household towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you ON Saturday.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
ok anyway, thank you very much!
then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get this back without any problems?
Fertility treatment for PKV / What is an "insured event"?
Hello everyone,
we have been in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly turns crosswise.
In turn:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and received the confirmation of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and childbirth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost assumption at the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones settle with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: with the pregnancy / birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts expire with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach you again
That's fair enough.
We will not order anything from you anymore.
If you add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost good customer.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was arranged and now they tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can probably not do anything for the fact that the chest of drawers arrives at me completely distraught
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There it is clear and clear that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect appeared only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise you may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good afternoon, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can you help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits for this.
Wikipedia has the following to say about this:
>A **low-budget movie** or**low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find abundant lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com .
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it reliable now?
Many thanks
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hi
"Half victory" against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
According to the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP), the EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way.
This state of limbo - Belarus does not give up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot prevail if a Member State takes it into its head to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: an agreement in principle on asylum policy will be made more difficult, since the line "Border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guard, meanwhile, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been pelted with stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be given medical care by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried to.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin in order to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU's response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly sends thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen allegedly committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an objection.
The silver arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken in violation of the rules.
A second appeal was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited fans to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park informs, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop,"says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing bright fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is this €#NUMBER# and not €1699 as originally?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 world champion.
Max Verstappen did it.
The Dutchman clinches his first World championship title in the Red Bull in his seventh year in Formula 1.
His way to the top of the premier class:
Abu DHABI - 2012, Italy: Verstappen gambles the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him upset at a gas station on the way back.
His mother Sophie Kumpen collects the teenager in the car behind him.
2014, England: The junior team of Red Bull gets promising offspring in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old is thus following in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
At the time, he was still racing in European Formula 3 for the time being.
2015, Australia: Verstappen starts at the age of 17 years and 166 days as the youngest pilot in history in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he has to turn off his Toro Rosso in Melbourne ahead of schedule.
2015, Malaysia: At 17 years and 180 days, the then Toro Rosso driver Verstappen is also the youngest racing driver to score points in Formula 1.
Verstappen takes seventh place in Sepang at the Malaysian Grand Prix.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen immediately wins.
At the age of 18 years and 228 days, he sensationally becomes the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his pole premiere in Budapest - he is not the youngest.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in a sold-out Blue Note and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the seashore and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
i gave up the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for their crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Ms. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not arrived yet.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Wow, then you are just as little serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier virtually distortion-free and color error-free right up to the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification information.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifier optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e. also in the case of impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - the magnifying glass is close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: in the municipality of Krembz, women pick out the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situations when selling fir trees.
Once a man even drove home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit fun, he says.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate this accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which sounds far from so delicious.
Problems with fiber + Devolo dLAN/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo dLAN, which received and sent out 50 Mbit perfectly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and they also arrive at the dLAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrive at the other dLAN module, which sends out the Wifi, but the further I go in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use an outlet that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, with the new fiber optic connection, the Internet is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the dLAN, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to still lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Anyone who would have thought that now there would be peace of mind with the current accounts for the first time, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25 .000 Euros for overnight deposit accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance even got right against this regulation before the Regional Court of Berlin.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole army of beauty
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a journey up and down.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance is taken care of by a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, according to Aniston, treat yourself to one chip a day (yes, that's right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she is simply unlucky with luck - and is still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Raikkonen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich holt 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 achievements is the goal of the bobsledder.
"I calculated that once, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Only on Saturday did he repel the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he went from third to first place.
Then he changed the material setting a little and took a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who is driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte wins home podium for Jamanka
In the women's category, Laura Nolte took her third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday at the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium place this winter.
The Wiesbaden-based Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free trips, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which upset me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping not started until 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on their website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the would be delivered incorrectly.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one or the other will be like that...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together since 6Y) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
On top of that, he is chilled and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x week), which makes me very difficult with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and stroking.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which of course we split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is quite well adjusted right now, I am reasonably well treated and I am coping.
Not good, but I manage and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me) right now, tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is on my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
Just until my birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll grab the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am so thankful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought to myself that I'm sure to find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order Today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, two times.
But it has not been confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed that way.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?I like to write in English I also understand that well
That's been a very long time, then I would refrain from it
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
i'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can not describe it in more detail anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live for himself, I mean.
The passage is, I believe, also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this tells you something, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a little from the stomach?
Or is it lying face first Directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was common practice, for example, to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But then why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used in this way.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it just so happens that the politics of this channel is now under everyone's nose.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be a "running advertising column".
What is one now?
An 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it back in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or burn marks and, if present, immediately dispose of them.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover for heating beforehand!
In the microwave at max. 300 Watts for max. 2 Minutes (Observe the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) check on the bend of your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensation.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are leaking, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents that have occurred in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought, power supply alone is also enough for operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
i am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
With a capacity of 20 liters, even larger photo equipment can be easily swallowed, which can be safely stowed away with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photographic equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the ”update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still grant access to the photo equipment in a matter of seconds.
This works with two options: One is conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stably riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photographic equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus store both separately from each other without any problems - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable risers help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is supposed to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the order of the
Contact has been announced by the forwarding company for the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with none I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
This is the return of the wrong delivered custom #NAME#
Is it possible to predict when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Have a nice evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I couldn't have guessed that the past year was different from what I thought and I just couldn't redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which, with the balancing of the disk, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the incisions improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of each car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprung up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was called: “Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to surpass your pioneer colleagues, so as not to go broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional promotions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, your selection will be revealed and you will place your pioneers on the appropriate sites.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gunslingers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available promotions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players will have to defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if you fail, you will get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not bullies" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
​Please take care, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never be allowed to us parents and other responsible persons! to go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Länder advise on the elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the federal states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test obligation can be dispensed with for three times vaccinated," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this as early as next Tuesday". − Reuters
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can not see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping is done via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often, it comes to hearing sounds / voices, less often to seeing pictures and most rarely to perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until Abnabelung.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex ** had none by definition.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 € will not help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that you take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also a standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again, the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I am already testifying to my gratitude for life here".
There are several types of pallets.
One of the most common are euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria per year is not collected
New York clinches MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and tender!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can do it
IIt is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME control, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
Above, it already sounded that you can even make a power reserve afloat with the POWER LEVEL control if it gets outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footswitch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, turn on / off the effect blocks and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is there a way to send the lamp back to you?
Since she hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me with this further?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only about 1.000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This was a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement continued after a break of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia now overtakes Saxony - Free State as the federal state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia is the only federal state to have exceeded the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 received intensive medical treatment in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly able to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will take place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a cheekiness in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Federal Day, you can see one thing: it is not extistent.
We got into a winter freeze and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What is the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
For the most part, this may simply be related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we are generally standing.
In recent days, the impression has become increasingly clear that many here are really still up for the Federal Day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who would like to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Targets:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure that I forgot some things, but that's not bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let's make a democratic decision about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/chunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about this.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
i have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in plus size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get these or to decide for the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived a vegetarian life for a while, and probably rarely eats meat at the moment.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, without which you would put it on.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not on site at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Unfortunately, since I can't be there for a funeral, this can't be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again all the time.
Lahnstein Weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment truck of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the State of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, increasing use is expected in the long term: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, but I synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# by June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for confronting the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, that is, we were also gun carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the civil servant comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality with difficulty, of course, because of course, in addition to the average white, you now have many Germans with a migrant background, women and homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotypical gays, because there are rather less or not at all in the executive branch, but quite normal men and women who you don't notice if they don't tell you) and you can also look at these people and do I have to leave myself, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds strange at first, in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks they have to do it right, but they just want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly make any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially policemen and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certainly right-minded people meeting who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that's a good thing in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
yes, what I do not understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG # basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part there are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have been getting it more bad than right to keep my household clean and tidy permanently.
There are always phases in which everything stops, and now and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come spontaneously to visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere, but most of the time household just loses against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with child?
We don't have one yet, but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visit and, for example, fresh clothes are always there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting anew and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearfully avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and, accordingly, I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (although I think that has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family help, for example.
But I don't know if the concrete everyday work is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("the simplest things are fucked up again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I really should know how to do this myself by now" / "I keep him from work with my stupid questions" / "he must really consider me to be low-income" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned at the point.
Have you got the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation of this either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by giving back please !
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, he asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
In its gastrointestinal tract, the bird breaks down the protein (protein) ingested with the food into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and uses these in turn to build up its body's own protein substances, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water / soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water / food daily.
One coated measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the approach of plumage formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the new plumage formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months ?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in opposition to the Articles of association
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
i have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So the application is submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the articles of association.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I get out of here now.. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a lateral entrant.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I will not name anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been around for half a year.
With the paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing around.
But I'm absolutely finished right now.
I have had so little free time in the last month that I am completely exhausted.
It's a holiday now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my after work was my after work.
I was free then.
And the stress at work did not matter in the moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures, which additionally annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is also doing well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it's not already doing that.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter as is now the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I will not have arrived at the same place again as now and I am dissatisfied.
You notice, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, that I'm completely finished and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of mine.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly recreates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the Virtual Element Technology (VET) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances are just bubbling.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to also meet newly added sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series again in 2010 - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what will ultimately fit in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the as yet unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, " the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions in damages
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was severely affected.
225 Hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about them, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes from rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with giftgiving.
Previously, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were presented to each other in one way or another.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into her window to three women in one night in order to spare them another life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom, popular in Germany, of filling the boots with gifts, especially of the children, emerged.
Protestants clashed with this custom, because they reject intermediaries between God and people as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they keep themselves safe from the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, it only upsets the least that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the custom of St. Martin with St. Martin's Singing and St. Martin's procession.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful muddle over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who in principle is a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man believed to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was stopped by officers a little later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground skewers.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 Hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow with color inside.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: this modern light object presents itself like a naturally shaped large pebble by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a supply line nor batteries.
Place the "luminous stone" in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied ground skewers provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
When dusk falls, "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; in which color, you decide for yourself: you can choose from six attractive light colors – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I have done this several times, it does not work.
It's a pity, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will no longer order on principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, this was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

The pill problem
Hello dear Weibsvolk,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again, because I have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I can not choose for myself.
My main problem, surprisingly, not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 during my last break of about two years and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without gedöns, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-Bupertär bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive nodular lichen and the acne issue.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and got stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It may also be good that the worm is simply hormonally in there, but if you have a construction site everywhere, like me, you also prefer not to go looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina or similar.
And now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large
since it is available in black

110 kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been at the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I currently still have big problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped at all, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
It takes me a long time to plan my classes.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and for me, actually, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would be really happy.
i would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about the Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to go.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales slumps.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth criticized sales slumps in transactions with items of non-daily use.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in the food retail trade and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel deployment.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all shops on that day with the ribbon received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate group specialising in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Most recently, the frequencies were at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, while sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business,"said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
i recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and got it delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it shut.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is provided by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply by pressing one of the memory buttons for a long time, it will be occupied and that's it.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is again - Very convenient when working in the studio, for example. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery One of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper indicator, the right on the lower indicator).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can connect directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories that you may still want to buy, without any problems.
It's a pity, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, which had recently been winless twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, got rid of the frustration of a mixed start to the season within a good hour and won furiously with 5: 2. "It's amazing what the guys did today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and pronounced a "blanket praise to everyone who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place and still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to "go step by step and remain modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on Wednesday in the course of the English week.
I'm just getting the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call at #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Unfortunately for me, that would mean I won't order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for women's handball before quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with drooping heads and blank stares.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said German coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round Group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a pity that we could not take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone, which we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the second World Cup of 2019 next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backrower Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defense, " admitted back-rower Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not at the height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top with the kick-off.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0: 4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game was early at 3: 10 after 20 minutes, especially since back-up player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into play a little better and by the break at least five goals had been scored.
The already only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could not get up to an increase in performance and left the floor as a clear loser.

The title says I am a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech / Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished to a large extent, it will continue for me in vaccination centers after that.
I am happy to answer questions with no time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related to you (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the education for the vaccination, the indication (a person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have none with us, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but who cannot (are allowed to) carry out vaccinations?), so that I also do most of the vaccinations there myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained in the series "Host mi?" this time, unsuspected by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also no one "for whom everything has to go quickly".
This, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatines.
"The Huidlerer", the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian Television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the rather well-known vernacular word "Houdern".
Which closed a gap in education - probably also for some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
The following error message always appears after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre selection for road bikes - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour in the coming week.
Said, done and I drove off with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurking around.
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to join the rest of the track under any circumstances.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and spare hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a half bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't quite so bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tires again before the bike ride.
But now I am faced with a question and I hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance in front of me over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, tore off 120km on the day I came to pick up the bike until 14 o'clock!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he has been on a roll with them for several years.
But when I think that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm in a really bad mood : D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be flat.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 € / tire now, only to be disappointed then.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike at the moment.
They also exist (apparently?) for the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use other tyres for a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems absolute to me! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a suitably designed foot is included in this construction proposal directly in order to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound should be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble rise.
This is generally common in broadband bands in order to optimize the bundling that increases too much at high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound, precisely aligned to the listening position.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and thus the sound picture can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies material again.
After all the panels have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate place in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45 ° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail Chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if you want to use finished strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next stage of work, the second side is attached.
After this, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable circular hole saw or a Forstner drill, the mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Then a circular milling cutter is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the footplate is firmly glued to the base of the case and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and unabridged cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it protrude there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and it can also be hung out there loosely.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which has not yet been completely closed, follows.
Due to the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed in with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For well-known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
