In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the Agency the participants of the event, Kherson managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now there arrived the equipment of the Russian Federation, "- said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, in the Donetsk region, residents regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Vladimir Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title "Hero City."
February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol - the heart of the war, will stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, Mariupol, will determine the course of the war - and if the APU is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights - we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) Are people who have dragged on a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and maybe not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory... "
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
Direct speech: "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we are not speaking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight - but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, no people. "

According to Ukrinform, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha, "the statement reads.
The DIU notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list here.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders shell and destroy key infrastructure, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, aerial bombs.

Bulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I expected with sadness is happening...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and did not doubt for a moment that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, in the Zhytomyr SBU, they gave me a copy of the shooting case of my great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from free people, a poor "one-yard" gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was sufficient to doom the paedophile and breadwinner of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the burial place.
Grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and all but two who agreed to give perjury were killed.
In the criminal case, there is the surname of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informant.
An apple from an apple tree not far, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio that doomed the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There is on Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources like "Immortal barrack," qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were imprisoned for it, and there he quickly died.
KGBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
On top of the thousand-year Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were superimposed.
And then they made a brutal genetic experiment on what happened, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.
Zo you saw my photos in a swimsuit

According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the variant on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a circular pattern.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.

Jab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number

Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after the three heads of state, among whom was the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility related to our history. "
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans there can be only one answer to this: never again!
The struggle must continue. "
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of cities blocked by it and allowing them to die from disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the executions in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have seen it on the news in real time.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you nanich

Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of the Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the context of the war, now there is a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and member countries - for the late delivery of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast "Fucking Questions" with the editor We are talking about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum.

I asked him just to talk, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "they have not done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army has previously refrained. "
The Russians have launched missile attacks on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorogozhichi near Babi Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, debris from a downed invader rocket crushed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenovka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, from which one person died, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile attacks on Kyiv, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians planned to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgrade stated that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold sweat the idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and societies as a whole.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples that elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.

The head of the President's Office, Andrei Ermak, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" on the weapons that our allies are transferring to us.
Ermak's direct speech: "They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness and seek to" bring down "the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is allegedly the destruction of S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to immediately prevent such fakes.
For the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to the next world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are condemnable," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian troops who withdrew from the area after being occupied for weeks.
The photos, which allegedly show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything so that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who" ordered "this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another production of the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia issued a statement announcing an "investigation" on charges of spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city and telling Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the back of the head, "he said.
He said Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies like civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In all, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in an area of Kyiv that until last week was controlled by Russian forces.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How occupants sneakily took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is one more point in this list, about which there is currently much less information - the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, Russian invaders have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave over to the Russian military training ground.
Ukrayinska Pravda found the Ukrainians and their relatives who were taken out to ask how the same "evacuation" was taking place and whether there were any ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text adhered to the voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the Antonov airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like the true Plast members, Denis and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24 they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses did not take anyone.
At about 12 noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people came into the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask: "Who is there?" - I say that yes. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were weapons.
All the men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "Here Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bely (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO" Viking, "who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took away the goods from there under the pretext "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, "You have 7 days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can not do anything, because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
They brought chickens to themselves, one tied a St. George ribbon to one leg, and to the other - their white scotch tape and called it "opolchenko."
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses - ours constantly fell into it from Bayraktari.
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio - there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe they gave us a "green corridor."
From the very beginning, we gave our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say that we do not want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with Grad or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for traitors to the homeland - they say, "they will shoot you there, they will sell you to the authorities."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burned out, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And then we hear gunshots! A rocket shoots, and a trace is visible - Iskander worked in Kyiv.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "Yes, no, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the Chonki sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came, says: "Here, I'm crest, I'm with Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves get you.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, so be it. "
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN office (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
The sanatorium was not kept by force.
Our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there constantly shoot from landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is generally not believed.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland, who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags now as there are Estonian ones. "
Maryna lived on the territory of the military town in Hostomel with her brother's family - his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, could not - the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday, somewhere in the center can not?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you to visit!
Thank you for the agreement, moths are good

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the good news - the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some had their hands tied and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were minors.
Olga Sukhenko, the headman of the village of Motyzhin, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were abducted on March 23, were killed and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
On the sides of the highway, 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go then there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the President's Office, writes European Truth.
"All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done late.
Therefore, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes, "Zelensky said.
When asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war, "he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but studies in the Czech Republic, in the specialty of tourism.
You really do not want to come for a moment with the children calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me. Wake up next to you.

"I tell her that the" repair of the TV and radio "was delayed because of imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to say too much when they call."
"We hide information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, in Plyamka (cat - UP) on the belly and hind legs, the fur peeled off - it can be from stress, a change in feed and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears sirens and explosions. "
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polevaya took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid from her both the war and the fact that I was around - formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her friend let slip, I gave her the receiver - she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours. "
The radio was always near the bed.
Mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She hears badly - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers," I hid in my room.
The first thing I hid from her was a receiver and a TV.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments:)

I tell you, embassies have their backs here,
The Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Aideen Aislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC with reference to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aislin who spoke with him
Literally twitter Eislin: "We received news from him:" 48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon. "
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the soldier Ann Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovites" without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed on social networks, in which Aislin allegedly speaks with his familiar American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they could not.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he left to participate in battles against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted Bill 7176, entitled "On Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere."
It is surprising that in fact the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere was... place for whom members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understandable - it is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The same as before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others can take off - for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and bill 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
But in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be fired.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by bill 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom, discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
For starters, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, in accordance with the law, the supervisory board has very limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All the fullness of power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry at all.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also makes arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "respectable foreign experts at the very first word" war, "in 2021 they leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
Firstly, this is manipulation - most of these members of the supervisory boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine," to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in the world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is just a new opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the invaders, will introduce an enhanced curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan regions, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5. "
Details: According to the head of the regionVA, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There's a word-for-word translation from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom I added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. Made in another bank. Because you had to have an account to work with.
The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously took the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians of 27 and 28 years old involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radiyo Svaboda," human rights center "Viasna," the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the power support of SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured.
According to Viasna, during the arrest the men put up active resistance and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others received on-site medical attention.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be harshly suppressed" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranavichy branch of BZhD and the administrator of thematic resources of BZhD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @ belzhd _ live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared extreme by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at the railway transport and infrastructure facilities of Belarus as part of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring, in order to fight, manpower and equipment to Ukraine.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting firms, "the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
It would prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

My girls now cannot move anywhere yet, so I did not write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear for housing information, then let me know.
I'd love to rent a house with some decent girl.
If you may know one, let me know.
For my part, I will not let you down.
Thank you in advance.
Not wrote you another person Natalia 54 years. Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I did not change my surname, I have one from birth:)
Good afternoon Mr. Reirard! I'm sorry I didn't see. I'll do it now and I'll send it to you right away.
We will now go to the medical examination
That is, Ana needs to work this hour another day.
What day is it better for her to come early? (maybe on what day a little more work?)
Tomorrow I will listen, the Internet is not working well. Good night
You're what you're gonna do
Thank you.. some of the things were found, but there was nothing of technology...
Both beginners, except the alphabet, we do not know anything
Nothing happens.
Is it possible on Monday 25.04.?
You can take children with you, there are enough toys here:)
I guessed about dad
I guess I'm very naive or very in love, but I'll come up with something with that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But as it will be paid for, please, no loans.
Write me straight and I'll help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should I take with me the clothes that I gave?
today is not my day. the blinds in the living room broke. in the morning alone. now in the evening another
Something came from you, I do not see that
I am also very sad
Let me remind you of the invoice to you later
Do you only have your dad speaking and understanding Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs.
Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a news from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons connections
The journalist of the TV channel "1 + 1" Natalia Nagorna released on the morning of April 12 a video that was given to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said "the bill goes to the clock."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade participating in the defense of Mariupol published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov, Andrei Beletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we are staying here
2 hours drive)) walking, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important thing
She forgot what she would do here.
The Czech drone squadron has started flights over Ukraine from today.
Almost 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ coordinator Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to maximize the effective and safe use of copters - the place of their deployment is now left in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, they say: in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can without it
I'm worried we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine, continue to work
All right. If everything goes well, I will agree
I will try myself, but if there are any problems I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the lady headman in the village in Jivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Perhaps she will rejoice and her mood will rise
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think that today I also froze on the street.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I am also sorry, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, throw off the music you like.
Me tsikovo, what are your musical pleasures
mom and dad need to obey
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow should be warm.
But do not pity the destroyed houses, pity the people who are bullied by the invaders
In Kherson, the invaders mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, crushed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those who died in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders tore portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was taken down.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given
In Czech, there is someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I live like in a hostelUp to twelve people will be here, and then go to work
Hello is a little better.
Today I was in a manger.
Even today I slept there.
Therefore, we already have great progress.
I'll definitely bring dumplings another time!
fashionable I do not have the strength to do them
Since I am repelled by the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after the guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about it..
hello, I'm sorry that I didn't write off dinner for a long time and slept a little
if you don't mind, I could come today?)
or meet after your arrival)
He is modest with us, he has been learning a lot lately. I realized that it is very necessary for him in life
Hi) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the department of economics of the upland region.
She was very happy with my work.
Grishko in the manger behaved well.
On Monday, I must bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for the nursery.
I'm lazy from Friday
I do nothing but much to them and I sleep (and I drink a lot of water)
if tomorrow I'm going to the doctor and went with you, if you can
I have to take another analysis
and so you do not have to go again
The drain tank works very poorly, it does not wash off well. We need a master. We need to adjust.
So there is enough of everything
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
And children are fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can go to you there is one question
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we did not really want you to raise funds so that people would not think that we were speculating on this!
But for online filling, two points were not enough for me:
I will go to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
What a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good, because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
so you can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
Collected several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays should hold the Internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day that I was not at work is a pass
Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine "of aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the specified brigade are recruited.
The enemy experiences a special problem when manning the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of warfare, will continue to strike at objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th combined arms army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dolgenkoe and Dmitrovka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasnaya, Rubezhnoye, Nizhny and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the Golden region, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopolye, Trudolyubovka and Maryanskoye.
On the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine repelled four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automobile equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to make it, but I doubt
And how can you sleep want and I detain you
You definitely don't mind me coming?
maybe you just have no desire to see each other today, then tell me, I will understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home, much less 1 + 1. We do not need to configure:)
I'm here to turn on the TV only to listen to the Czech language
I have today ends the package tariff for the month:)
Can we do it today on the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We only then with my father will meet, be sure to ★ ★ ★ ★
I read the ad on Facebook, then apparently Google wrote something in his own way, I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we are the things that you brought, but there are things that are small on us can you bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then next week I can start to go to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labour office to submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains:)
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working on Teva
Friends are old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
I have talked to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed about your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later - as usual, Sasha answered succinctly. - Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you - those who worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduza, Navalny's organization and a number of other places - have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except perhaps participation in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, perhaps, fell a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you owned freedom and democracy to a certain extent - messy even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up gripped by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the tsar's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think that he is safer. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option - and dutifully resigned yourself to plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for him or chose not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
I then worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of civilians, about the children killed, about the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: "Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens. "
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the mid-2000s, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to make good money, some have gotten rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased new housing and found better jobs.
Prices have risen, but is it a problem?
Moscow beamed festively and bald with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin transferred the post of president to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after several months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia flagrantly violating international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you massively protested.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground underfoot.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still do.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who fooled their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan - and never left.
They completely independently built a tent city and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
The police eventually opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job poorly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there is little benefit from it.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth suddenly came from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It is difficult for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hiding a new one in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new ones after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binbags, public wifai and hipster cafes.
Indeed, the Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and only gets better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview, because I allegedly did not understand what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself how on the streets of Homs state snipers calmly shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I kept silent - because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent - because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense. "
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Someone really speaks now - like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny's company.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians - or, as seems very likely, if he does not succeed, he will take on you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but for the most part alone, went to the protests and still took place in a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for an anecdote, remained not in such a distant past - and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his superiority may be on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war at all.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know where it's going.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hokhma, your laws, aside from the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either go somehow or get crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
Yet there remains one more.
Which in the end will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare up from you: due to the impending economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to light up in the province, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies by itself, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool - the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization has been crushed, but other, more informal, more decentralized structures can be created.
There are a lot of you, there are millions of you.
The Moscow police can deal with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with hundreds of thousands.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a damp cell under the police clubs.
This is what has been happening for many years - and will only intensify, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act in cold blood, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home
