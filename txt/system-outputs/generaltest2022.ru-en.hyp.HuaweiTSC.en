From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

With horror I remember these feasts and guests in the house of my parents.
The guests are on the threshold, and the cutlets are still roasted on the stove, the mother is swollen on the floor.
Lord, I sat down at the table without strength.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days of cooking, the day of cleaning after.
And what are the guests?
They are good, and the cake must be with them.
Since then, I do not like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I lay the table at the minimum.
And I cook sweets for them, bake very often just like that.
Germany: The fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against influenza."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of coronavirus Omicron.
And the new option is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert said.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib XL series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not only for casting.
These vibes have a greater specific weight than their counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature of the XL is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in the plumb, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching zander and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive feed of the bait is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter pond trout fishing.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS by NanoSound) or without it (SL by Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is capable of teasing a passive pike that does not react even to live bait.
When casting, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For casting pike, zander, ruff or perch, in addition to uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with "chirping" along the bottom.
If you catch in confined places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the baits of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success in both relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

7 thousand Russian mercenaries announced in Libya
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabiya airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), "the Anadolu agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Keep presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and a port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency said.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine countries in Africa - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, "the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the form lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with dominant Islamists, TASS reported.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the election of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article says.
Against this background, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia TV channel reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more success than failure in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of success -" in Syria they defended, restored peace there, "" the decision on Nord Stream-2, "" the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons, "" We squeezed Crimea. "
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," "isolation from the world," says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper record keeping - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai announced the complete rejection of paper-based office management and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," the Crown Prince of the emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said on Saturday.
Now internal and external document circulation in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: health care, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 level
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for 11 months was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year.
And if in the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive trend compared to last year, then in the first 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferment on loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, Kazinform reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, pursuant to the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127" On approval of the Procedure for granting deferred payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses "was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities to defer payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The period of delay was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME subject.
The borrower's application could indicate a different period of deferred payments.
During the period of deferment, the claim work, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended against the borrower, "the deputy prime minister said.

131 SMEs applied for deferment in MFIs, of which 95 subjects were granted deferment in the amount of 105.8 million tenge, "A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily tolerate the ocmiron strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the ocmiron coronavirus strain could be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ocmiron" originated in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
Due to this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds suffer it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is mad at the young, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to threaten with a finger, it beats like a cannon on sparrows, - Sergey Puryasev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin to be vaccinated in Russia before the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory of MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Teens who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarten students, "Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory of MIPT, told Moscow 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of covid
The authors of the work studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid, and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to avoid the response of the immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this.
Biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orientating even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible, "he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Formerly Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Educational Institution of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepov spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return home about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington, "he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Now employees of the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, where a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally exported from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers."
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote mode of work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline before which employees can get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego."
He is already out of any literary associations, spat with imaginism, he is on his own, but known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia" was published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat signed an agreement with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets Sergey Alexandrovich received such honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
Funds that year were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange family life, to support sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September,
Alcohol showers brains.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had given up a lot, looked bad, and was obviously sick.
More and more often repeated walks, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin will come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this ground, drives to the police abound - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 1920s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Elders remembers:
"I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, scratched his face and hoarse.
Having recovered a little, he began to cough continuously, sprinkling the whole sheet with blood... "
And Yesenin himself, after a trip to Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except pubs and streets...
I'm already in the end and people stopped memorizing...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because the melancholy gnawed. "

Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made a statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenka," but he "is actively searching for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is sure that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It concerned 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a mockery
The social events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not comply with the royal dress code for the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah also tried on the trend.
The player came to take the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House."
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interweaving the threads, a dense fabric with a fluffy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but relevance.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable for those cases if the invitation indicates the dress code" Black Tie "or" Creative Black Tie. "
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the correct advanced party with wealth," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brammell" believe. "Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin proposes to combine a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from Brammell's Beauty are sure that the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate event will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then" yes, "he is such a thing in the subject."
If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not according to Senka's hat," the editors of the Telegram channel believe about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, so painfully pulls.
And it is not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid.
Billion investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not at the expense - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The penny is dripping.
And who then in the flight?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who have "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I did not see a single beautiful person on the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not sit down to them, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "handsome men," but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave position and fights against it, is a revolutionary.

A slave who drools when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires the good and good master, is a servant, a boor. "
The immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the coronavirus strain "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron."
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or vaccinated and got sick, then he received" hybrid immunity, "that is, there are many antibodies and enough neutralizing ones," the expert said.
The G7 warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to "ease the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities," as US President Biden spoke about during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response, "they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's reserved position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response, "the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of the British diplomacy Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would suffer "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective from the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug for COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original version of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukrainian Defense Minister accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Defense Minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andrey Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany Robert Habek visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed ways to return money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be saved to a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start a refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is assigned to the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecompay, emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safer Internet League Yekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream-2.
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to oppose the Nord Stream-2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the operation of Nord Stream 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. Congress official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the G7.
Dmitry, look more carefully.

Let everything be fine with them.
It is always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, or something, that you have to wash them directly.

He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the church wall will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that riches and prosperity await devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say," You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do, "KPRC-TV quotes him.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that occurred in Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time donated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
Therefore, the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not that "she is financially much richer than all the scribblers," as they write here.
There are people and richer, but not everyone behaves so impudently, so defiantly, as this madam.

In Brazil, citizens were obliged to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, it was obliged to require covid passports from those entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luiz Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons who came from countries where the absence of a vaccine is proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged tourists who were not vaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection against COVID-19 is revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Worker of Science of Russia Anatoly Altshtein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by introducing an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
With internasal use, immunoglobulins A are formed in large quantities. When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination, "the doctor said.
Chief preventive specialist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the pattern observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked with a dog (died long ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, caress, love and games for a tech bitch, then go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and generally clever.
I chose my society and went home.
On video a way that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they did not run after the dog, although they lamented that there were 200 thousand running away (pomski), took the hand straight and took it to the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog that ran somewhere there.
Mass protests of vaccination opponents do not stop in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some were holding posters saying "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then turned into clashes with the guards.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe that they both deserve this title.
Here is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans bore only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO found "omicron" already in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus "omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that, according to preliminary data, the new strain may bypass the delta strain, which is also the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially several hundred people are currently sick with "omicron" in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the omicron is still unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, they communicate easily and naturally, and at a personal meeting there is nothing to say.
And to see a person live, perhaps, this is not what you expected, not hooked - hence the attitude.
When he meets his man, then his views will change.
And again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons."
Yes, then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What ideology today is money at any cost.
There is little faith for talkers like Globa (and there is no faith at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to keep the warmth of the relations of the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's product director Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication means is dipfaces.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real records involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of a person for distribution for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis leading system engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow me to paint much and walk in short skirts, show stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but there was such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women also painted, and showed frogs.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there are no cosmetics.
Listed five actions that will help avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increase food absorption.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to deterioration of well-being on the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often "weekend migraine," said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics especially often suffer from this, who have a headache, brokenness and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On weekends, our life changes radically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness. "
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then there will be a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on the weekend.

South African scientists announce low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South Africa announces low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists of the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the (level of) effectiveness of the vaccine of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product, hidden sugar can be indicated - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues the transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for the energy transformation of Ukraine was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers hacked Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked him to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of voters voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against."
The turnout was 43.90%, more than 80,000 New Caledonians took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence in many ways revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmur repeated repeatedly.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of Caledonians be the choice of France."
Light, oh, hello!
I'm a little... a little nahamila, still embarrassing, ashamed.

WSJ readers criticized an article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries "to act as a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to" lose "and Ukraine is not our land.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine to start producing new generation jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by the freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president Alexey Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like, "Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that it was a jet, not a piston UAV.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been conducted by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this figure in a greater or lesser direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid milk flakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men after 50 years eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75 thousand people may die due to the omicron strain
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75 thousand people may die in England in the next five months, if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicrone strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot exclude infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicrone strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected over the past 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I read it to this place:

Demand for superyachts grew by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has been no such excitement in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted on the zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of hardship, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying on their own airplanes cause irritation in society, because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a yacht REV Ocean with a length of 183 meters.
After launching it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool," as well as a submarine designed to study the deep sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter platforms, open-air cinemas have become common, and on some of them, such as on the wrestler McGregor's yacht, a platform for martial arts. Richard Wilk, professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's largest pollutant Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint fell on his yacht Eclipse, 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not arouse the sympathy of other people when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol was determined, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer.
The Daily Express writes about this.
Experts concluded that the use of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drunk men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not know how four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how the intelligence of animals is developed.
Although the dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or write poetry, do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistical data are not enough for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, the United States and Russia prepared for bargaining
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offeror.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned, "the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
"The training is carried out covertly, quickly and immediately turn to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be discovered and deployed by counter-forces," he said.
China stimulates development of railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said company representative Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and efficiency of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first two-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe, were launched from the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," Feng Yaoxiang said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheykin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Golosheykin said.
Earlier, a charity for dementia research in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years.
Doctors named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychonervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the medical council established under the Georgian Ombudsman, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character, "the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president should be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychonervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officers subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a disease, or a medical evacuation from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and airplane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure, landscaping works are also being carried out in the region: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes open catering points with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwu now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which slowed down the progress of humanity in the issue of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the WB stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of pocket."
In October, UN Secretary General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have practically no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan minister cut off from broadcast at "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the US-sponsored "Summit for Democracy" was put into video-free mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world by the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free," and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam in red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to the "one China" policy pursued by Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that after showing the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."

It is not necessary in one heap - there are bad people, you can have claims to them on a specific occasion...
but what is the number of children, age, pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "scoundrels, did not return the money."
But how many and when they have children, it is not your business until they gather these children to hang on your neck.
And if this is excluded, so what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, it is only in education so...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their rules, frankly spitting on existing ones.
And if it will concern other spheres of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
And if the father still implements his method of upbringing and education?
Some kind of horror and an example for others is very bad.

The Foreign Ministry told about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion after a long journey that we have gone through with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday, "the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is connected with the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug for COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may have allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points in airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary, "Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person vaccinated with a stuffy nose swollen after injection.

During the day, 1239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in the UK.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.

Peskov warned of suffering Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not to suffer yourself," said the official representative of the Kremlin on the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of ballots were canceled.
The level of voting on that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the location of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO preliminary considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminary believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, omicron is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly changed antigenic protein profile of the omicron strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than in the "delta," "the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta."
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They "were previously immunized," the Gamalei Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that so far there is no reliable data that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

Four scenarios for Zelensky were named in Ukraine
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <... > internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)," the ex-parliamentary added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbas, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between the population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives" are likely.
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
Some event can lead to this, which will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At this, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while for the country's ex-president Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the bakhchi and not before the beginning of August.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For the quote of Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poet of Russia.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police treat you during the arrest this time and earlier?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the employees were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, no matter how ridiculous it sounded in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya riot policemen took and took hard.
They asked standardly about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey being blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action, at least a few people begin to write their poems under this hashtag, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and yet resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, the transcript is kept in the old-fashioned way with a pen, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.

The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol.
The root contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.

Due to the high content of fiber, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or cook the root, rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only replace imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issue of Yandex
Candidates for departure
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto," but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (part of Gazprom-media) is available.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to the earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth, "said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metauniverses will change Russian business
The topic of metauniverses became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of its own metauniverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metauniverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing the diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want something too fat and harmful.
Of course, we will have a traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one makes me eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoon, try - and enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time, money it took on trainings.
And after completing 5 quarter jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that 4 years before the next Olympiad she will not survive, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And the one who did not just play sports or can not imagine all the circles of hell that she went through, DO NOT LEAVE WITH CONCLUSION.
The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks had already outlived itself" and it was time to return to relations where interest rates, taking into account inflation, would correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department of Opening Investments, Mikhail Shulgin, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and concerns against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing pleases: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
Now it is better.
There is progress, only sluggish.
There is another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxi that take waste from home.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leader in terms of revenues in the Russian market.
For 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai has an even more significant growth - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year at Hyundai, it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had stronger price growth dynamics.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands grew not so significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"At the same time, Mercedes-Benz has a good growth in sales and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity," explained the general director of NAPI Tatyana Arabadzhi.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands show fantastic performance, which also significantly increased their financial capacity this year. "
In terms of the dynamics of revenue growth, the Russian Lada shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose car sales in pieces fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and production disruptions that have engulfed the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers regularly rewrite price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says VTB Capital's automotive industry analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining high sales margins. "
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income from volumes, notes independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are trying to get the greatest profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car purchased a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in case of Russia's invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending US military to Ukraine in case of Russia's "invasion."
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States has abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
Immediately I leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burda and wash another cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find myself a normal place, without an euchar layer, where you immediately talk to the head.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, then it is ineffective to immediately dump, and most likely not to have time to blacklist.
Because to confirm his lies about his involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.
More useful recommendations for the people are needed.
That's such nonsense...
I do not believe that it was so.
They do not know what to come up with, whom to accuse.
They reached the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except the most...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if ours care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence weakened and infections became less...

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, not in the subject.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
