When I tried to buy an entry package, I found a blue and orange package.
The price of the orange one is more than double.
What's the difference?
I didn't know even if I looked it up, so please tell me.
Now, there should be only blue ones.
If there is, it may be just an old product left.
Both are the same, just because they look different.

That's why I don't want to watch TV anymore...
I wonder if it's because it's impossible to be a comedian? television is full of entertainers.
I saw Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there are quite a few scenes where the staff laughs behind you even when you are saying something that is not particularly interesting.
Even though it's obviously not an interesting place, it's creepy to laugh at everything you're saying because you're a popular performer.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainers will be in a bad mood, and I guess it's a bad relationship at work.
Like the black companies of the past, that industry is like a sports club, and it seems that some entertainers' ego is too big and they usually have a bad attitude, so if you don't do that, you won't be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who say "Don't lick entertainers" one by one, as if they're adding to the difficulty of their work.
I know my income is pretty low until I can sell it, but even if I'm told that I'm at the top of the top of the list of occupations where the work of an entertainer is not good.
It sounds like a glorification of one's own career and a justification for the comedians' position in the media and society being too high.
To be honest, the industry I work in is also quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the entertainer world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt like it was not good for me if I didn't get out like a fart...

Mail order of Ikemoto Shoshi Kogyo
Hairbrushes available!
Buyers will receive a sample
The product i ordered at the tsukumonet shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse, and I received a wired version of the mouse, and I was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
It's a mail order problem rather than a topic of self-made PC, but I can't accept it no matter how I think about it, and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen (link to Gyotaku) at the Tsukumo Day sale at the Tsukumo Net shop that started last Friday.
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so I checked the wired version page considering the possibility of a price mistake, and it was 5,071 yen (link destination Gyotaku), so I ordered considering the possibility that it was not a mistake
I received the order email normally, and I received the next day's shipping email.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page
At this point, I thought I'd get the wireless mouse I ordered, because I didn't receive a notification of a mistake or a cancellation notice from the time I ordered it to the time it shipped.
Here's the problem, a few hours after shipping, I got an email saying "There was a mistake in the registration of the product"
According to that email
The wireless version was sold at a discount, but it was actually a wired version
We've already shipped wired mice.
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return and refund only mouse
3. Use the wired mouse as is
You can choose what to do with it.
The product pages of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and although it is written as the wireless version in the purchase history, email, and delivery slip, it seems that it was sent by replacing it with the wired version without permission
If you are sent something different from the product you bought without consent, and you want a refund, don't you think it's bad to send it back from here?
Even if you finally accept the refund, i'd like to fight back, so please lend me your wisdom

Isolated twice... Typhoon and heavy rain washed away the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple their food stockpiles < Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture > (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Matsumoto Yoshiro from the highland area of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The East Japan Typhoon in 2019 had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "At first, it's like 'seriously?'
The only road leading to the highland area, the "highland bridge", was swept away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 residents from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off the water continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass, to carry the necessary supplies.
Mr. Yoshio Matsumoto: "Normally, cars can come to the garden, but when you get out of the car there, you can hold it in your hand or carry it on your back and walk across the iron bridge to come here, so I felt grateful for the means of transportation and the car."
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to somehow secure enough for two to three days. "They have about three times as much food as before the disaster that can be used as emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles.
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, I don't know when a disaster will hit me, so I felt once again that it's better for everyone to have a little stockpile."
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Manager of Yamatsuri Town's Education Division: "We've made an announcement that we'd like to set it as' Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day 'and make October 12th a day to think about disaster prevention preparations next year and beyond.
I think I've become more aware than ever of the possibility of unexpected things happening. "

One participant said, "The scenery has changed a lot and it was really fun."
"It's really fun to be able to run while having fun, even though it's hard when you're running in the streets of Tokyo like this, and I'm glad I was able to work hard until the end while competing with everyone else." A representative from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said, "I want people to enjoy it at sports gyms and other places in the future," and hopes to install it at the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
Pitfalls of the Building Condition Survey System (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
A new "building condition survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Second-hand housing transactions are booming.
The prices of both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a house has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, the popularity of properties represented by the soaring words "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station", "large-scale" and "tower" has concentrated, and the number of relatively cheap new properties has decreased sharply, which may also have an impact.
[See images in this article] However, compared to other countries, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act, and started a survey called "inspection", which is a survey of building conditions for the purpose of safe and secure second-hand housing transactions (https:// www.mlit.go.jp/common/01219900.pdf).
Under this system, an architect who is well-versed in housing checks the current state of the building, including deterioration of the property, and the condition of the building, compiles a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) explained that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid complaints after delivery by conducting property surveys before the sale and purchase transaction, giving buyers a sense of security.
In turn, it will lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to grasp the condition of the second-hand house they are planning to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it is a system that has great benefits at first glance.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative to investigate the building condition.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect who will investigate the building condition" or "we can't", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems have already been put in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.
In the pre-sale phase of a home, buyers ask experts called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" to conduct a building survey.
In the U.S., for example, inspections are conducted for 70 to 90 percent of used home transactions, depending on the state.
In the sense that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection, the nature of the inspection is very different from the Japanese-style inspection where the "seller" is the main focus.
The seller shows the condition of the building as good as possible and tries to sell it as soon as possible at the highest price.
On the other hand, buyers would like to live with peace of mind by carefully examining the contents of the survey and carrying out appropriate repairs.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap between the objectives and thoughts of both parties.
For this reason, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japanese system.
The scope of the seller-led inspection set by the government is kept to a minimum.
Because it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking a really important defect ● For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "careful" inspections will be conducted, such as not reporting survey results that are disadvantageous to sellers.

It was pretty tough.
However, I was mentally cured (?), so I was full of motivation.
I couldn't keep up with my body, so I was in a research position, so I fell asleep at work.
When I was in the first year, it was the second time, so I thought lightly that I would take a month off and say goodbye to the fucking garbage company, but it was more severe than I expected and the medicine did not fit I wanted to see it and it was prolonged.
Anyway, it's important to get a psychiatrist to handle it properly and keep a history of hospital visits (super important).
If you have a history of going to the hospital, even if you leave the company for personal reasons, you can change it to retirement for company reasons at the discretion of the doctor in Harowa, so the hurdle to receiving unemployment insurance etc. will be lowered.

Was Ginza an island?
5 Miscellaneous Things You Can Talk About While Playing Silver (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
"This used to be a peninsula.
As proof of that... "It is also unique to Ginza that you can show off a little bit of trivia.
Here are some tips on Ginza that are interesting to know and will surely make you want to tell someone about it.
Going Above Ginza!?
First infiltration of kinza.
As you walk through Ginza, you will find traces of the history that the land of Ginza has carved out, such as strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, and many shrines.
When I was walking around Ginza with her, I suddenly came to a silence and said, "This used to be a peninsula.
Ginza used to be a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Tokyo's Chuo Ward is synonymous with the downtown area that has created "XX Ginza" throughout Japan.
Originally, "Ginza" was a mint for silver coins, and in 1612, the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was relocated to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shin Ryogae-cho", but when it moved to Kakigara-cho, it came to be called "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" sticking out into the sea.
Before the Edo period (1603-1868), an inlet ran from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is where Ginza is today.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city block and built a moat to develop boat transportation.
He then cut down the dirt from the moats and Mount Kanda, and reclaimed the inlet.
In front of Tiffany & Co. 's Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument that says "the birthplace of Ginza", indicating the site of the Ginza government office, so if you're interested, why not look for it?
Ginza's "pilgrimage to sacred places" known only to those in the know
Every year in Ginza, there is a "pilgrimage to sacred places" known only to those in the know called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour".
Of the more than 10 sacred shrines, the one that is most visible is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabukiza Theatre.
Many people visit the shrine on the far right of the Kabuki-za before and after the show.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudo-son" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo-son" is on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine" and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not noticeable, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon Also, "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the first floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Ksitigarbha are enshrined, but most of the shrines enshrine Inari.
The Inari Shrine, where a fox welcomes you in front of the shrine, was built frequently in places where there are many farmers, as a blessing for a good harvest of rice.
However, in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, it was said that there was a blessing for prosperous business, and the faith spread even in Ginza, Japan's most downtown area.

Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Sennex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on the 12th that it has signed an agreement to acquire a stake in Australia's Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, procedures such as approval at the general shareholders' meeting of Senex Energy and approval of the local subsidiary remain, and the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This acquisition marks the largest global acquisition and merger (M & A) since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total acquisition amount is KRW 770.9 billion, of which POSCO International will invest 50.1 percent and Hankook Energy will invest 49.9 percent.
POSCO International explained that the decision to acquire the company was made based on the belief that demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the hydrogen market along with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local onshore gas field operators in Australia.

That knee pain may be "osteoarthritis of the knee"!?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor-in-Chief: Recently, I've been suffering from knee pain.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "osteoarthritis" is common in Japanese people.
Editor-in-Chief: Does that mean that the joints will be deformed?
Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can wear out or become distorted.
As a result, it leads to deformation and inflammation of the joints.
Editor-in-Chief: Does osteoarthritis develop in areas other than the knee?
Maruyama-sensei: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers of the hands, neck, hips, thumbs of the feet, and hip joints.
However, the most common is the case that occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor-in-Chief: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: The joints are made up of two bones that are unevenly combined.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the area around the joint is wrapped with "articular capsule".
Editor-in-Chief: It's a complicated structure.
Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the articular capsule, there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is made up of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That's why people say that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements.
Editor-in-Chief: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Maruyama: Articular cartilage has stickiness and elasticity, and plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, so to speak.
However, if this is worn out or distorted, it can deform or inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?

"Kaiji" series of gambling and games that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity, especially among men.
One of the real pleasures of this game is the extreme game that puts one's life at risk.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my legs shrug... Challenge yourself to cross the steel frame!
So, this time, I'd like to examine Kaiji's games that can actually be played or that are practiced in the planning video.
Swamp Swamp is a trap-packed pachinko parlor that appeared in "Gambling Hakkairoku Kaiji."
In the original story, Kaiji was surprised at the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" had large traps of "nail forest", "movable roles" and "three-tiered crunches", and it was considered almost impossible to capture them.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of means, and in the end, he went out into the rough business of placing a vinyl tank in the building and tilting the ground, and captured it brilliantly.
"Numa" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per coin", and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you will be able to taste the feeling of Kaiji.
Steel-framed crossing At a "star side party" held by a rich man as entertainment, Kaiji and other debtors were forced to carry out the steel-framed crossing of "human horse racing".
Borrowers compete for speed as they try not to fall on a thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people will participate, and the top two will be able to win the prize, but there are only four steel frames, and safety measures are insufficient, and the possibility of death is quite high.
This steel crossing is dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience an extremely similar experience at the Eagle Bridge set up at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.
The Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building) and there is a single steel-framed bridge, and beyond that there is a "Sky Blanco" and a "Victory Bridge", and you will walk to it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi posted a video of her walking on the Eagle Bridge on her YouTube channel, saying, "You can experience steel-framed crossing in Japan," and it became a hot topic.
E-Cards E-Cards is a two-person card game.
Using a total of 10 cards, one emperor card, eight citizens' cards, and one slave card, players are divided into the emperor side and the slave side.
The game is very well made, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperors.
In the play, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa with a strict rule: "If you lose, your ears will be cut off."
After all, Kaiji realized that ear-destroying devices such as earphones attached to his ears were reading his psychology by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and by shaving his ears to the limit and making his body abnormal, he confused the Tone River and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, posted a video in which she competes with Fujiwara Tatsuya, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, with an e-card, which attracted a lot of attention.
There is also a chance to taste the feeling of Kaiji?
Everyone doesn't want to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it's also true that when you read a manga, you only get a taste of the mood.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A large ema (votive tablet) of the tiger at Gokoku Shrine in Yamagata Prefecture, gently encouraging the first step towards the new year | Yamagata Newspaper
A large ema (votive tablet) of next year's zodiac sign "Tora" has appeared at Agatagokoku-jinja Shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are underway.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed the shrine, visited the shrine and held a memorial service in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has asked students of the University of Arts and Technology to draw original ema (votive tablets).
This time, a work by Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was selected from among nine students in the Japanese-style painting course of the Department of Fine Arts under the guidance of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and 1.8 meters high in the center.
Tsuchiya said that he drew it with the image of "the cherry blossoms gently pushing us on our way to the new year."
The figure of the tiger standing still and gazing at the cherry blossoms expresses the hope that "even in a rapidly changing world, we can afford to celebrate the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on ema (votive tablets) distributed to the general public.
"I think it will help all people overcome difficulties," said Chiba Kenichi (44), Gonnegi (Provisional Negi).

Let's think about "Tamano who wants to continue living" and make a proposal 4th high school students workshop in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-digi
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano that I want to continue living in".
As part of a survey and policy proposal project by the Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center, an intermediate support organization, the project will gather the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answered questions such as "when you get excited with many people" and "when you are playing drums".
The first event was held on November 13th at Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
Using the "World Cafe" method, in which 18 high school students and local residents move around and talk about "islands," each with a specific theme, they thought about "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns where people feel a sense of purpose in life."
Write down each idea on a sticky note and put it on imitation paper to organize.
"A town with a lot of young people looks interesting," he said, "Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
We will discuss further whether there is anything in common.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is attractive," said a third-year student (18) at Tamano Commerce and Industry High School.
A third-year student (18) of Binan High School said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have a place rich in nature," and by talking with adults, they seem to have realized not only the issues of the region but also its appeal.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to sort out the contents of the proposal.
They plan to invite the mayor and the head of education to make a presentation in February next year.
The center's president, Higashi Rie, said, "We hope that this will foster a love for the hometown among high school students and encourage young people to take the initiative in community development."

How to find a new way to wind a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Stoles are indispensable in winter, but don't you have a time when the fabric is sluggish around your neck?
It is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding, but sometimes I hear that I do not know the trick.
I thought it would be nice if there was a stole that could be rolled up quickly without the cloth holding back, and then I found something novel.
The stole of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is a more compact size than the general one.
When I first saw it, I was like, "Can you roll it so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is made into a single piece by knitting a long and thin piece of cloth, and the whole is like a mesh.
The ends of the stole can be passed through the mesh.
So, you can wrap it up and fasten it without tying the ends together.
Made of fleece material, it is very light and warm.
This year, the sleeveless gilet (vest) is also popular as a jacket, but many people will wear it in combination with a stole so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I'm sure it's convenient to have this stole.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super fun
It's called Get Buck, and it's directed by Peter Jackson.
It's kind of raw, it's kind of like a life-size Beatles, and it's kind of fresh...
It's just before the breakup, so I'm doing gisgis, but it's not the dramatic gisgis that I imagined.
There's a troublesome Paul who's trying his best to divide things up like, "I know I'm annoying, but come on!", George who's a bit of a "butaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
We don't hate each other enough to fight like that, but there's a certain feeling in the atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance started, everyone was really talented.
It's a dangerous process to finish "that masterpiece" while each other is doing "how about this?" from a little phrase
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing.
It's amazing that the scene where the casual humming like humming gradually becomes that Zucha ♪ Zucha ♪ and the lyrics are included is well recorded.
It's amazing because it's not easy to see the process of composition like this.
Also, of course, everyone is greasy, so just watching the performance scene makes you happy.
It seems that it is still one of the three episodes, but so far the biggest cause of the dissolution was probably the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles itself.
The four of them seem to be having fun when they start writing songs while complaining about something, but when it comes to the location of the live performance, producers and publicity people say, "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!"
Well, since the director's interpretation is also included in the documentary, it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, Paul seems to be overseeing it, so I thought maybe that's why there are so many scenes where Paul looks rather bad.

I was in a sales position, but I was sick enough to die and changed jobs, but at that time I was not good at doing sales activities on my own, but I thought that it was very suitable for sales activities that were needed by customers, so it was a different industry, but if I chose that kind of job and changed jobs, it became very easy to work.
I was told that I couldn't do it, but I think that if I can find something that I am good at and what I can do, my way of life in the future will be somewhat easier.
← Of course, I think it's okay to think about this after you have a good rest and have some peace of mind.
However, I think that there is also a daily life, so if there is a company union, an industrial physician, or a consultation desk, there may be some kind of system if you consult there, so I think it is a good idea to consult once.
It would be nice if I could live with a comfortable feeling in the future.

Tornadoes frequently occur in the U.S., causing major damage Unseasonable warmth and strong cold weather (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, tornadoes occurred frequently, mainly in the southern United States.
It is thought that cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed due to the extremely unstable atmospheric conditions caused by the strong cold air moving southward where it was record warm for this time of year.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
Strong cold air of -30 ° C or lower came down to the south at around 5,500m above the ground where the temperature had been record warm, and an active front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It is believed that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern part of the United States has always been prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this time.
The number of tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter season reached nearly 150, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts on the 10th (Friday local time).
According to this, there are two main areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line that includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third highest of the six levels on the EF scale (the improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of the tornado, and it is believed that a gust of wind of around 70m/s was blown in an instant.
Depending on future research, it may be judged as EF4 to EF5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the improved Fujita scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale, which is adapted to the conditions of Japanese buildings.
There is a good chance that JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, will occur in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses will collapse.

Live broadcast calls for help from under the rubble of "the biggest tornado in history" (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, U.S. President Joe Biden said on the 11th (Japan time) that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history" with a mysterious look.
CNN TV and others in the United States reported.
"We will do everything as a federal government," Biden said.
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives have been lost," he said.
The death toll is feared to exceed 100.
Photo: Residents carrying household items from broken homes in tornado-hit Kentucky From the evening of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
The tornado hit Missouri and other states in 1925, with a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers), but CNN's weather experts estimated that this time it was the largest, at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was severe, a candle factory that had been operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas sales season was also severely damaged.
At the time, 110 people worked there, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of it.
In the dark, a woman who was stranded under the rubble about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of rescuers searching on the rubble and asked for help via a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also echoed screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You", which another woman supposedly sang in tears to distract her from her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe after hiding in her basement with her five-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people liken it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrifying sound like a reverberation of the earth, like something spewing out more," he recalled.
"The search will continue until it is no longer necessary," a Mayfield police officer said.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will be. "
In Illinois, at least six people have been confirmed dead after Amazon's warehouse collapsed.
Trains have been derailed due to the impact of being cut off, and expressways have also been closed one after another due to the impact of rolling over.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, have lost power.

It has been said for a long time that the way of thinking about the star system is different.
While other countries will deduct points based on five stars, Japan will add/subtract points based on three stars as neutral.
There is already a difference of two stars at the reference point, and four stars have completely different meanings, "There is a point deduction element" and "It is not a masterpiece but an honorable work".
If you use five stars as a standard, "works that have no shortcomings" and "works of the highest standard in everything" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a defect in the system that does not present the meaning of the star, but since such a system is actually operated in such a way, I would like you not to give three stars (bad reputation).

< Saga Taberu Aru Ki > "Hakobune" 's "Fried seasonal fish caught in the nearby sea and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce" | Lifestyle & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento "Fried seasonal fish caught in the nearby sea and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce"
"Hakobune" is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli dishes made with plenty of vegetables.
Kazuki Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year, "so that people can enjoy the atmosphere of a restaurant at home."
One of the popular bento menus is "fried seasonal fish caught in the nearby sea and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
I choose the best fish at the market at that time.
According to Takayuki, "For the fried shrimp, the raw breadcrumbs are made as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients," and you can directly see the plump texture of the fried shrimp.
The lunch box comes with about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli, rice mixed with Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture, rice mixed with minor grains, and soup.
Vegetables are homemade from the buckwheat fields and purchased directly from shops in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki has trained in French cuisine, and lape and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, they offer a mix of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as "a familiar and relaxing taste" (Yumi) like a dashi-maki egg.
The lunch box "Tegone hamburger steak with domestic matching meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, they will also be selling "Charcuterie Set," a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

Overall rating It's not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it would be easier to use if there were a little less people or consideration such as getting closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to make a dedicated lane so that it would not get in the way of other people walking.
However, I thought it would be a good vehicle if there were a little less people because it was relaxing and I could relax while watching the scenery.
It was a difficult ride unless you had a very patient heart, with the excitement of the near future feeling that this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the eyes around you.
Oh, my god, i was embarrassed.

If you look very closely, you may understand a little, but they don't use any eel at all.
Actually, it's "Eggplant!" (Tap to get the correct answer)
I like eel, but in fact everyone is just eating it with sauce, and I thought that the eel part could be anything other than how it is actually grilled... I thought that the texture and volume of the eel are quite important.
I didn't want the eel to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat it.
Recipes used: EGGPLANT "UNAGI" - Woks of Life (Sansho (Japanese pepper) is used instead of green onions.)

An attempted murder case at Saga City's Daizai on the 12th after a man was slashed and escaped on a motorbike | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around #Product6#a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on a street in Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, and his face was injured.
The man escaped on a motorbike, and the Sagaminami Police Station is looking for him as an attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Station, a passerby called 110 saying they were "fighting."
The man suffered an injury about 10 cm long and about 1 cm deep on his left cheek, but he is said to be conscious.
The man who ran away is medium meat and skinhead.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was found near the scene.
The man said he had been drinking with several acquaintances, and the investigation is based on the assumption that there was some kind of traffic problem between the pedestrian and the man on the motorbike.

A family's long journey to establish environmental protection activities in China's frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong Company Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest variety of mammals and the world's third largest variety of plants.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists in addition to the environmental protection carried out by local governments.
Xishuangbanna (Xishuangbanna) in Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such area.
Sisapanna is an area bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flow through the area.
Xishuangbanna Thai Autonomous Prefecture Although the area of Xishuangbanna is only 0.2% of China's total area, it is home to about 25% of wildlife species and 20% of plant species.
This time, we met with Ms. Li Min-ha, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and talked about the contents of the activities.
Started environmental protection activities with her German husband ― ― I heard that you have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the trigger for that?
Ms. Lee Our environmental protection activity "Tianzuo" started in 2000.
It all started with my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China science project.
It was the only tropical rainforest region in China and was one of the most biodiverse.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests was carried out in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and to study biological resources.
Then, he met me, who was a reporter here, and got married.
Didn't you have any interest in nature conservation before that?
Lee: I'm from Sisapanna, but I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or what biodiversity means.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I decided to proceed with the project with my husband.

[Oma Tamaki/Personal Memorandum] MOD Cause of CTD in my environment, and it took about a month and a half to identify
Stable data until March Since around GW, CTD due to multiple factors has occurred while I can not take much time to play, and it took a lot of time to identify it if I looked it up little by little only on holidays.
Why didn't .Net Script Framework parse the logs (and you'll know in a few minutes)? Some errors in .dll series and meshes don't remain in the crash log.
Main timing of CTD
* All papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and log type .dll plug-ins do not leave a footprint in the log.
* Improved with "Essentials be Gone" (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree SE update reprint) OFF * There is a possibility that this is a false charge?
* Basic improvement: setting competition in relation to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit
* (Basic outdoor) While moving the field + some magic (e.g. frozen rune) is activated, when NPC is hit: Dirt & Blood v2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) Everything is turned off and everything is improved after 5 consecutive attempts.
Is it due to a mistake in the shader settings of the body mesh or additional armor that some actors/NPC wear?
At first, I focused on checking by falsely covering up the part attack and OnHit-related motion/battle mods (those in .dll), but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German, or French level.
If there is a person who has a similar CTD problem in the Japanese environment, I thought that it might be helpful as a reminder, so I posted it.
Everyone's doing it with a pretty tight mentality.
People around you don't notice it, not only your colleagues but also your family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that he is working well and well even though he seems to be having a hard time.
But perhaps he's just as mentally prepared as he is.
I didn't retire on the pretext of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before I left.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing - After today's home-visit nursing
Since I am suffering from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving home-visit nursing care for a long time, and I think that I have been able to build a very good relationship with the nurses (female) at the home-visit nursing station that I am currently using.
Every week we talk about a lot of things.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (e.g., a package), but above all, I realized through today's home-visit nursing how important it is for people with mental illness to have fun communicating.
Today, we have a chat about gender differences between men and women, and we also have a discussion about gender theory lol.
We also talk about the sexual desire of men and women, why she got divorced, and whether it's okay to be a home-visit nurse.
Sometimes, I dress up as a woman.
However, in the case of the home-visit nursing station operated by a psychiatric hospital, I have heard from an acquaintance that an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only handles clerical work, or that an occupational therapist comes to the home-visit nursing and gives instructions from the top, such as "Because we are doing medical care".
I'm using a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think she's a really good nurse who faces me frankly on an equal footing with me, who has a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing care, and some of you may be thinking about receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves it, you should definitely take it.
And let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there was a place where I canceled the contract from here because I couldn't get along.
I'm sorry.
I know it's a fake warning, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There's a number of things that could have caused this, like...
・ I don't know what the person who made it will say in Japanese
・ Problems with language detection
・ The browser setting is set to English.

Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth of China's... "lagging behind in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (JoongAng Daily Japanese edition) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the Korean government announced a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
The plan was to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative total) by 2022, and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of hydrogen is 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the dissemination of hydrogen stations, the core infrastructure, is 38% (about 117 locations) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the range of 8,400 won, which is not much different from the time the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is far below the target.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Businessmen (Zenkyoren) released a report titled "The Current State of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem and Policy Direction."
According to the report, most of the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the US and Japan.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (USA), Gore (USA) and 3M (USA) supplies membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020).
However, the federation said, "In effect, six countries make up the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually lower among the competing countries."
The ranking of patents by country is China, the US, the EU, and Japan in that order.
Since 2017, when China overtook the United States to take first place, the gap has widened.
As for the number of patents registered in 2020, Korea ranked 4th with 1,033, surpassing Japan (974), but it is 22% of China (4721).
The Federation suggested that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large amount of tax credits for capital investment and R & D expenses.

Today PS5 was sold at the store for 70,000.
It's legal.
Because it's free competition, for example, if a brand has more scarcity value than the list price.
For example, it's legal for a painter to become famous and the price goes up.
The fact that Ps5 is being sold at a high price is also a rarity value, and it's just that it's worth more than the list price.

Making TV-style flyers' Newsbooks' of lawmakers in progress of parliamentary reform in Takasu: Hokkaido Newspaper Doshin Digital Edition
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as the creation of an unusual flyer to announce the holding of regular meetings and the introduction of a "report book" where townspeople evaluate members.
The town assembly election has been held without voting for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
On the 9th, about 1,800 new flyers were distributed in newspaper inserts in order to publicize the Sunday assembly that will be held on the 12th.
Raw guillon from morning, tetsuko's room, sawaguchi hitoshi exploration series...
The leaflets distributed by the town council to all households on the 9th are filled with words reminiscent of the names of popular TV programs.

US aid arms and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, also engaged in unit training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials said equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine by Monday under a security aid plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid totals $60 million, with the last piece of equipment to be shipped to Ukraine at the start of the year, including four radar units that can identify launch points, such as mortars.
The aid also included lethal weapons, such as the Javelin anti-tank missile, according to Pentagon spokesman Kirby.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's military buildup around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. is increasingly wary of Russian troop movements and is in talks with NATO members to devise a response in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
On September 1, Biden approved weapons aid to Ukraine's President Zelensky during his visit to the White House.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine this year amounted to about $450 million.
Since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has reached more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian troops.
Last month, the U.S. sent the Florida National Guard in line with a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
The U.S. special operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising the Ukrainian special forces, the Pentagon said in a statement.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a confidential matter in the conduct of the operation.
President Joe Biden held a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense conversations over the situation in Ukraine.
The US is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The direction of the "review" of inheritance and gift tax, which makes gifts "forbidden" while alive, hits Amari Akira, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission!
The first feature in the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talking with your family during the New Year holidays!
It's a gift and rush inheritance technique during life.
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, it was postponed in the 2022 Taxation Revision Outline, which was a concern, but there is a great possibility that gifts during life, which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, will become "forbidden" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Along with a direct hit on former LDP tax commissioner Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, I will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for a last-minute gift in time for the end of the year.
(Hiroaki MIYAHARA, Diamond Editorial Department)
"From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale studies toward the establishment of a tax system that is neutral to the selection of the timing of asset transfers."
A sentence in the FY2021 Tax Reform Outline announced by the ruling party last year caused major unrest not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what he meant was to completely change the rules of inheritance and make "gifts during life", the royal road to dealing with inheritance tax, "forbidden" in order to raise the inheritance tax significantly.
The ironclad rule for tax-saving measures for inheritance tax, which is highly progressive, is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation."
Gift giving during life, the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of this, the debate over the "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" came up.
Although it was postponed in the FY2022 Taxation Revision Outline announced on December 10, which was feared to be the fastest introduction, a policy for unification was announced again with more in-depth language, such as "reviewing the current tax system for settlement at the time of inheritance and the calendar year gift system" and "continuing to review the tax exemption measures for gift tax because it is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (omitted)."
Amari Akira, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Research Council and former secretary-general, told the editorial department.
"The most important thing is to lose the advantages and disadvantages depending on the timing of the property transfer, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when you go.
At the moment, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise. "With the fastest revision, there are three chances left to give gifts while alive.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future there will be a major turning point in the direction of invalidating gifts given while alive as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly will the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Right Brother" Terrestrial broadcast from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Furukawa Yudai will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
Photo: Yamatani Kasumi, the heroine Based on the manga of the same title by Morie Satoshi, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE ・ LOVE" since 2018, this work is a sad pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the past on their shoulders.
The main character, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Riyo, is played by Yamatani Kasumi.
University student Riyo meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
For some reason, Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can get a good night's sleep with Riyo's help.
Riyo is drawn to Kairi, who looks like her older brother, who was separated from her parents after their divorce, but isn't she a murderer?
Comment from Furukawa Yudai The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10th!
Those who couldn't see it on FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will know more about this work if they can see the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Riyo, and the state of the two people who are struggling and changing after knowing the development.
I hope that fans of the original will also enjoy it.
Please stay tuned!

[NFL] What and how did the team players who won with three passes in one game feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
That's the lowest number of passes in the NFL in the last 50 years since Bill's two passes against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
In 1974, the Bill's had a genius RB named O.J. Simpson, who surpassed 2,000 yards in the previous season for the first time in history.
Bill's beat the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The weather was the main reason why the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and in terms of latitude, it's no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On that day, the temperature was about 1 degree Celsius, the wind was 18 meters windy, and there was a snowstorm before the game.
The Bills didn't change their play choices much because they were local.
There were 25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was never a failure.
There was a scoring machine, with four red zone invasions in the 10th offensive series.
Especially from the end of the third quarter, he advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three innings, he was only able to score three points in the first FG.
Defending in front of the goal at the end of the game.
Following four, Bill's was penalized with a 3rd & 9 and ended up with a 3rd & 14.
It was 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd & 14th, QB Allen came out of his pocket and flowed to the right, surrounded by the rush of the Patriots defense.
He then threw a pass aiming at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was out on the right, was free in front of the end zone by running the Sharo-Across, but it seems that Allen did not see it.
On the 4th & 18th, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis who ran into the end zone from the outside left, but the pass ended in failure when he was hit by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in the front.
Bryant was covering Bill's WR Cole Beasley one-on-one, but on the way he saw Allen move and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Having missed the two receivers, Allen threw a pass for the end zone on both occasions.
The pass of the 4th down may have been a decisive blow, but the 3rd down did not have to aim for the TD.
You only need to take the first down in two plays.
It was only before 2 minutes, so if it was 4th & short, Allen's ability with his own run should have been alive.
She's got a shiny hair that comes together.

Three items that tend to be placed in the kitchen for a long time, "when to throw away" and "when to change" (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponges
No matter how often you change it, you probably don't change it as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (but it's still recommended to sterilize in the microwave).
The German researchers who did the study recommended changing sponges once a week to keep them clean.
Cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that cutting boards should be replaced when they start to wear out and become scratched or grooved.
This is because once the wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean and bacteria can grow.
If you're still okay, don't forget to sanitize frequently with a spoonful of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in a gallon of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and leave for a couple of minutes.
After rinsing with clean water, let it dry naturally or tap it with a clean paper towel to drain and dry.
Chipped or broken tableware
It may be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the chipped surface becomes a new hotbed for bacteria and bacteria.
It can also cause the missing part to cut your lips or cause your drink to spill.
Yes, it's your chance to buy your new favorite mug!

FlashBIOS won't end Help
I bought a ryzen 7 5800x, so i replaced it with a b550 and a tomaho that i bought in september.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted it, the white cursor-like dot on the black screen didn't flash, and it was in a state where it was accepted all the time
I thought the BIOS was damaged and tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't end at all.
According to msi's blog, it'll take about five minutes, but it won't take an hour.
The possible cause is that the usb drive is too old and the one that converts the sd card to use it.
I don't know if tomaho's crazy because she's sleeping too much.
Is there any other cause that looks like it?
Don't you always want to be a man with a straight face?

I'm embarrassed to have a brand-name product for some reason.
If it's not noticeable, you can hold it, but you can't hold something like Vuitton that's written Lv in a monogram.
Why is that?
I think it's good that it fits your length.
By the way, I think it's good in Japan.
If it is Japan, it is.
It's nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say as soon as possible, "Why am I the only one who's not calling/talking?"
If you think that it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, it's better to simply say that you're uncomfortable.
I don't think you'd ever dream that you'd be uncomfortable with a reasonable probability.
I was living abroad on the way, but there were a lot of Japanese people who came outside because they didn't like the upper and lower Confucian customs, including me, and I misunderstood that it was okay to say anything to the local people.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you're doing it with a kind of sweet or friendly feeling without pure bad intentions.
Even my friends from Europe and the United States would call me by my lower name, but when I speak in Japanese, there are moments when I'm a little confused which one to choose.
Well, if it's a friend, it's still fine.
Originally it was purely normal, but if you overlook it, you may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment of being a gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Since it's japan, i was wondering if you could talk about it according to the japanese rules.
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do that, you won't be treated strangely by younger or older people, or you'll be treated like Japanese.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, have people (including me) who look at the details like that.

Thanks for 50 subscribers!
When I opened reddit today, I found that this sable that I just made had over 50 subscribers.

Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer until 50 people went, but for some reason only today 25 people have subscribed, so I am very grateful.
If you've subscribed to this sable today, I'd appreciate it if you could tell me where you found it in the comment section! (I'm really curious because I don't have any idea)
I'm the only one who's doing it right now, so I'd appreciate it if you could do it too.

I only understand a little bit of English, so I only judge by the translated text.
I think the translated text is at a level where you feel a little uncomfortable with the text, but you know what you want to say, and you don't have a problem playing (just because I feel this way, I think you should ask other people too).
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that if it is a small company, it is a person who is well translated.
For non-native Japanese speakers, understanding the nuances of the Japanese language depends on whether they can reach it even after studying for a long period of time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, it's a good idea to look for someone else.

Discussion "Demon Slayer" Training is the battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human hymn < Commemoration of the start of the anime "Yukaku-hen" < (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among the recent boys' comics, "Demon Slayer" is particularly different because "there is a lot of training".
It has become an established theory that there is no battle in most cases, and that the training edition, which trains both day and night, is not popular among readers.
That's because in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", there were two years of training when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, but only the touch was drawn and the rest was blown away.
Well, one of the charms of Wampi is the eccentricity of the land you walk around, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
Now, it can be said that the training of Sumijiro, the main character of "Demon Slayer", began when Tomioka Yoshitake, who saved his life, knelt down on the ground and begged for the life of Nezuko, who was trying to take his own life, and Yoshitake told him, "Don't let others hold the right to kill and rob!"
The weak have no rights or options, and all they have to do is be defeated by the strong.
While saying that, he introduced Rinotaki Sakonji, an "educator" who trains those who wish to join the Onizatai, to the kindness of Yoshitake (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
Sumijiro's first contact with Rinotaki was when he was asked, "What would you do if your younger sister ate someone?"
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of narratives among fans as well.
However, walking around with her younger sister, who has become a demon, carries the possibility that the moment may come when she will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that it is an initiation to enter into training from a mental attitude.
However, Rinotaki takes Sumijiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt.Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air on the mountain is thin and full of pitfalls, trebuchet machines and traps, so I'm going to die before I start training.
Even so, it is barely "hero correction" to sniff out the faint smell of a trap set by human hands with his sharp sense of smell and somehow avoid it.
Even so, "That doesn't mean that your physical ability suddenly becomes high enough to avoid all of it!!" That's the essence that makes Kimetsu Kimetsu.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become stronger without any support, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills they have honed up to that point" at their original potential.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human hymn that is different from an ogre with unfounded paranormal power, and it is a hard-to-move rule that is consistent in this work.
Is this old?
It's not a bed yet, it's a way of sleeping where you lay a mat directly in the house and sleep on a futon or quilt.
Because my house is not an apartment.
That's what i do.
If you want to use a large room, it's better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Are you obsessed with it?
Are people who work as part-time workers and want to work full-time and work with other stores obsessed?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, I don't think it's "agonizing".
I think it's "agonizing" to plan something more like this, to somehow get more profit than effort with minimal effort.
Are there any smoking cessation outpatient clinics nationwide that are currently doing this?
I do it everywhere.

Samsung Electronics Korea establishes "DX Division" that integrates home appliances and mobile, "emphasizes user experience" (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) following the integration of CE and IM divisions as a set division, and that this will be reflected in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
The aim is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile devices to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the new DX division, which was formed by integrating CE and IM divisions, will consist of business units such as VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
"The name change reflects the company's medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and global leadership," said a Samsung Electronics official.
It also emphasized the intention to make it easier for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, as well as service solutions that reflect customer needs.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the company's strategy of creating synergies across the company and building a foundation for differentiated products and services across organizational boundaries has also been reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to allow users to freely use content and services through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

BCE stands for "Before Common Era."

> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is spared and dragged below.

It is a bit unnatural here.
The larva of the loach ambushes in the sand so that it can catch its prey at any time, and only the disc-shaped head is peeped out of the sand.
I think it should be.
What's bothering me
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at it from an ant's point of view
Is that so?
If you translate armoured heads as a disc-shaped head, I think the part that says, "On the ant scale, it's a giant beast with a helmet" will disappear.
Aichi 24-car crash trailer driver has no chronic illness, careless? (TV Asahi Corporation (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In an accident where 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office did not have any chronic illness, and it was found that the accident was caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested Nomura Katsuya (54), who was driving a trailer on suspicion of first causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the police on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to move without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, Nomura did not have any chronic illness and was believed to have been caused by some carelessness.
The police are searching the homes of the parties concerned and investigating the situation in detail at the time.

Kinnikuman Review of Oginuma X [Comics Volume 4] (weekly pre-News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began with volume 3, is now complete with volume 4!
In contrast to the first volume, which depicts everything from the opening game to the semifinals at once, it is full of new tricks because it focuses only on one game!
Review of "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Author Oginuma X ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman professional wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, this 4th volume is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it is not just a book that depicts the game on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, the scenes of each other's check-and-balance battles and special training, etc., have changed from before and it's hard to go to the match, but it's not boring at all.
This feeling in the work, where the tension gradually increases as the first battle of the century finally begins, is surely connected to the rise of the reader's tension, and I am impressed that even this period is a truly calculated production.
And one more mountain before the important final, not to be missed is the third place final match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Not only is it gorgeous as a match card, but what I like is that before the match, behind the scenes, the ramen man points to the Kinnikuman poster and says, "From now on, it's my turn to aim!"
And he tries to smash the chops.
However, a Terryman who happens to be passing by catches the sword and stops it, stares at each other without saying a word, and the scene is just that and parting.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a person in agony over that Kinnikuman.
If you can see this, you can't help but think about your future success!
As a manga artist, I am still keenly aware that this is what it means for a character to stand up!
The fight between the two doesn't take much time, but the famous scene is an appeal of tears from the ramen man after the match.
"Don't rely on the strength of God's luck!!"
That's the line.
This is already a magnificent meta statement about the work itself, I think that readers have felt that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character, and that he is somehow winning where it is not his ability.
However, by having the ramen man say this, the boiled egg teacher took the initiative and stabbed him with a nail, saying that he could not use his hand anymore.
With this quote, the reader would say, "Oh, so Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin with his ability?
How? "
You will be able to stir up your imagination again by the uncertain development, and from another writer's point of view, this is a line that is as if the boiled egg teacher who makes the work imposed a binding on himself.
I thought that this was a great thing.
I think it's definitely one of the main points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held at Aobayama, Takahama-cho (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illuminations that began on November 26th include a 20-meter-high camphor tree, as well as 50,000 LED light bulbs scattered along walking paths and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "It's been a long time since I came to Fukui, and I was surprised that there is such a place.
It's so beautiful and I was relieved. "
The illuminations were planned for the first time to give visitors a sense of healing while avoiding the crowds, and will be lit from #URL#pm to #URL#pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25th.

Online distribution, promotion of agricultural and livestock products Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, live broadcast from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities in the Okitama area and JA (Japan Agricultural Cooperatives), conducted PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," which sells products while streaming videos on the Internet.
Yamagata Ai no Bushotai and others appeared remotely on "Nationwide Collaboration MI NATO (Minato) Market TV" planned for the first time by Tokyo's Minato Ward, delivering the charm of the region along with local specialties.
The Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project, a collaborative initiative between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, led to the decision to open a store, which was broadcast live from Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama sommelier", wears a stole from the Yonezawa textile brand "nitorito" and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.

I've been unhappy this morning.
The NAS PC won't turn on anymore 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened?
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is energized.
When I returned to the room after a while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from the PC and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought it was just the fan's movement getting worse due to the temperature drop (6 ° C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Without starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is turned on for a moment, and the fan also moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, i won't say anything.
I unplugged the power plug and tried again, but it still only turned on for a moment.
Connect only the ATX 20 pin and 4 pin to the motherboard, remove the other parts and try it, but it does not start.
I've always heard a buzzing sound like a PSU fan was hitting something, so I'm wondering if it's because of PSU.
I'll find the remaining ATX power supply later and try it out.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work... what should I do?
I'll change the case and mother together.

How do you dispose of computers and peripheral devices?
* PC Farm
I've only brought it in once, but even though it's in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, they don't collect it for free from Saitama Prefecture.
(There is free if it is relatively new.)
* Inverse Net
I've never used it, but Sagawa seems to be completely free with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of using it, so if anyone knows it, I'd like to hear about it.
* Oversized garbage, etc. (charged), postscript > Local government collection boxes (free of charge for small home appliances)
* Sell second-hand.
Postscript > Mercari hard off
I wonder if there are people who sell it at flea markets or auctions? I have never sold used PCs.
Maybe it's a smart choice to sell it while it's making money.
* Information provided by Linet Japan:/u/CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers, old UPSs, etc., which are not picked up anywhere, are getting in the way.
It's not the size of bulky garbage, so it probably won't cost you money, but it's somehow postponed.
I'm collecting coins as a hobby
If you know how much this coin is worth, please let me know.
Coins circulating in foreign countries have no value...
Money is exchanged in Japan, but coins are not.
If it's a commemorative gold coin, it's worth it because it contains gold.
Even though he didn't do anything bad, there are times when he dislikes it, right?
Yes, likes and dislikes are natural because we are human beings.
"I don't like something (for no reason)", people who don't like it are like that.

I can't have a girlfriend, but is she discriminated against because of her face?
It's not a face, it's a heart.
But it's sad that it's decided by appearance.
Because I can't show the inside.
What did you do with your school sportswear after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^ _ ^
I threw it away right after I graduated.
Yome wore room wear until we started living together lol
Is it possible for a person to become a full-fledged person at any time, even after 90 or 100 years of age?
All your sexual desire and youth will be lost.
If you are healthy.

I think it was different than the opponent up to the semifinals, but why is such an opponent in the third place final match?
I would like to plant a blindfold tree in my garden. Please let me know if you have any recommended trees.
Hopefully, an evergreen tree that's easy to care for, preferably one that bears fruit.
Thank you very much.
In order to bear fruit, it is better to plant trees nearby that bear other fruits such as olives, blueberries, plums, etc.
How much savings do we need to have to live together to live comfortably?
It is different for each person.
It also depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better not to live together.
There's a high chance they'll break up.
It's better to make a matchmaker, hold a wedding ceremony, go to the bridal, and hold a wedding and reception.
There is no merit in living together.
I don't think you should.
Today I went to the game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Gun Balancing.
Oh! I thought it was a legend rare, but it was a re-recorded legend rare (^ _ ^;)
Do you have a hobby of playing card games like Gambalizing?
I think it's ants.
