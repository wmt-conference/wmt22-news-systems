Fake, seller writes own reviews!
Fake MAc.
MAC doesnt even make this palette.
Seller has written positive reviews for her own item under the same two names, one Alexis and one ._...look at all the reviews they write for their own products.
Why does this go on here?
These guys should be stopped
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers have appealed for anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Keith Green - Relevant for the Ages
Though it has been over 3 decades since Keith left this life, his music still resonates with truth.
This was one of the first albums I purchased of Keith's "back in the day".
What a sweet album of praise as he moves through the Psalms!
Excellent Design and Functionaality
We bought one for road trips and trying to interpret maps without having to strain our eyes.
Really nice design, good tactile feel.
I couldn't figure out where the batteries were, sent Lightwedge Customer Service an email and received a response within 24 hours.
If you need one I'd recommend this one.
PM Modi Tweets Tribute To Jacques Chirac, Calls Him True Global Statesman, Friend Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of former French president Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the loss of a true global statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at age 86. He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007.
"My deepest condolences on passing away of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the loss of a true global statesman. A friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building India-France Strategic Partnership," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India and France have a strategic partnership, initiated in January 1998 during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India. He again visited the country as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time.
Kinked hose with vinyl separating - Returned!
I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this.
I also read the reviews raving about this hose.
Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get.
My luck wasn't good.
The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.
Gilmour makes great products
For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.
They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.
This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.
It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.
I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.
Quite a company!
Not worth the $$
This is a very cheaply made product.
I would not pay 1$ for this.
The paper is cheap and flimsy--the book will not even stay open (with fear of ripping the binding) so that I can open up to put on piano stand to play.Don't buy this version.
Groomer in Training
I am currently training to be a Groomer/Pet Stylist and this is the book my company uses in their grooming academy to train all groomers.
It is wonderful.
It is very helpful to know that you can turn to any page in this book and find the breed of dog you are looking for.
There are also general instructions that apply to many breeds (ex: teddy bear heads, etc).
Directions are simple, yet detailed enough for anyone to understand.
A must have for groomers and pet stylists!
Book is not about sewing circles, but about putting circles on a quilt by applique
I was hoping for tips on how to sew circles.
This book is all about attaching circles to the quilt with fusible webbing and using raw edge applique.
Not even any tips on applique.
The good news is that the book is only 35 pages and didn't waste too much of my time.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Extremely Informative
This is such a brilliant book!
i was given this book as a reference guide while i trained as a professional groomer and found it so helpful and informative!
the instructions are detailed enough that it never leaves you stuck with a million questions but simple enough that anyone can understand it.
this is a must have book
This game is boring.
The quality of the pieces is really nice.But there is little interaction between the players and there isn't any rhyme or reason to the difficulties of the monsters and no way to improve your characters.
So if you are just interested in a luck-fest, this is the game for you.
GGGGGGGGREAT
I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks
Only foundation I use!
I can not buy this any longer in local stores and this is truly long lasting and does the job.
It doesn't melt in the Florida heat and is sheer enough to be natural but have adequate coverage.
I have been using this for about 5-6 years now.
If you're looking for a tiny printed novelty you'll love this
I've always loved The Prophet and I've read it many times.
I gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement.
I purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book.
If you're looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you.
If you're looking for a "real book" then this is a joke.
very handy--wish it came in a sleeve
I carry this around in my bag (just in case).
I will have to make a little sleeve for it so that I can cut down on the lint & scratches that it collects, though.
It works very well and is the perfect size--not too big to be gauche, not too small to be ineffective.
taste is awful
When I was incarcerated in a Mexican prison, this was the only drink in the joint.
We had to fix it with goat's milk and heat it over an open flame in the yard.
The taste is awful.
It's not pleasing like the thick, hot Chocolate found in Madrid.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers" six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Beautiful...
Beautiful in every way ,well written , superb photography , and fantastic instructions.... make this book a " must have".......whether you use this book as a coffee table, or as a reference book, it is definatley "Top Shelf"..........
I also gave one as a gift...... the receipient was overwhelmed....
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
This is the product I had been seeking.
This is the product I had been seeking.
After 3 weeks brown spots are gone.
No more need for heavy cover-creams; regular liquid foundation works for me and my skin is beautifully clear.This is a good product.
With consistent use, it removes blemishes on my face and dark spots on my elbows.
longevity is very bad
At first these are fantastic.
Strong, good charge.
But after about 20-maybe 30 if that recharges, some of my batteries just dead.
Or do not hold charge for more than a night.
It is reall bad.
I bought about 5 or 6 (4 packs) of these, more than half of it are useless.
Anointed!
I love the songs on this album and how Keith once again focuses all on the Good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus.
The songs are timeless, the anointing is fresh even after all the years since they were written.
I think that's a sure sign of anointing is to see the fruit remain.
Missing parts, Cheaply made
My kit arrived with parts missing.
Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots.
After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back.
The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap  kit.
I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back.
What a disappointment.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house rammed by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Beginners Beware
Here's the deal with this pedal.
It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money.
In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.
Not Very Good!
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days.
I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon.
When it did work it worked very well.
Perfect!
I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.
But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!
The "rubberized" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!
I was disappointed that you would only allow me to purchase 4 when your inventory showed that you had 14 available.
We have many of the old, old issue.
But the number had depleted.
There were not  enough books to allow us to use them regularly.
With the additional supply the books will be used more often.
They arre a good old standby for gospel singing.
Lots of FUN!! Very CHEAP made!!!
We have this same game but it was made in 1967, we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better!!
This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard!!
We just gave this game a way and kept our old one!
!
Not worth it.
When I bought this combo, it was more expensive than the 3 DVDs bought separately.
Unfortunately, I saw it too late.
My bad.
But where's the logic ?Then my cats didn't like those DVDs.
Well, more like "not interested" than "don't like".
TV off or Cat Sitter is the same.And really those DVDs are cheap.
Always the same videos, the same animals, the same noises.
I mean, what's the point of hearing birds if we are seeing fish ??
?I was more entertained by those DVDs than my cats.
Memories
My mother-in-law bought this video for my daughter when she was young.
I was looking for videos the other day for my three year old granddaughter and came across this.
My granddaughter LOVES this video.
She watches it OVER and OVER and OVER.
It is older, dated and corny, but she loves it!
We even find ourselves singing the songs!
have you changed the rubber formula ????
Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses.
You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..
But I am only giving you 4 stars  because this hose and the 100 footer I bought  a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?
NOT CLAPTION MUSIC VIDEO!  A Learn How To Play Guitar LIKE Clapton
I bought this DVD and I'm returning it.
The description and editorial review are misleading.
This is NOT a Clapton video.
Certainly some clips from Clapton, but generally this is a "how to" video.
Same applies to Clapton  The Early Years!
ANNO 2070
I have been unable to play this game.
Unisoft has made it unplayable if you are not a techno whiz.
( I have tried several times to get it up and running.)
I just want to play in my home not on the internet and for some reason it will not load on the computer.
I probably will never buy another UNI-SOFT game or product..
I have found my holy grail of skin cosmetics

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in lab
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
His last album is focused on Praise
Keith Green / Songs for the Shepherd:  His previous albums were more focused on encouragement and correction towards the Church.
This, his last, is focused on Praise.
This one is still not as great as his first album, but it is a strong enough Praise album to earn Five Stars.
Just what I was looking for
This magnifier is just what I was looking for.
It is small and easy to hold.
I wanted something to read small numbers/characters on electronic stuff like computers, electronics, etc.
I also work on the insides of computers and this is great for seeing small things.
I don't want to magnify books or magazines.
The light works well and makes reading small things very easy.
Battery died right away.
I would love to give this a higher review.
It seems like such a great concept and I was so excited to get it for my son.
But the battery died 2 days after we got it and of course it takes a small expensive specialty battery.
Not impressed.
Great Hoses
Good USA company that stands behind their products.
I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you.
I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises.
The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time.
Highly reccomend.
Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.
Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."
This is not real MAC. Its fake. Seller selling all fake MACs!
this is fake MAC, i just received mine and super upset to find out it isnt real MAc.
Amazon should have better control over sales of Fake makeup.
MAc isnt cheap, when you see price this low it should have been a red flag.
Dont support sales of Fake makeup.
Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.
The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
FAIL
JUNK!!
!......This product must be miss labeled.
I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.
The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.
I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.
If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.
It charges fast and is dependable.
Thank goodness they are expensive
Yes - this is one of the most expensive candies around, because it only comes imported.
But my goodness - are these ever good.
The KitKat folks could really clean up if they started selling these in the US.
Once you try them you can't wait for more.
So yummy and delivered quickly and fresh.
Great hymn selection
The hymn selection in this edition is very fine, but the paper quality leaves something to be desired.
For a book in which singers are going to be thumbing through, using the index, turning pages as directed, the paper quality does not look like it will stand up to long term use.
Two different ones broke
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.
As a result, it broke on the second day.
Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.
I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner
martha stewart's wedding cakes
I have bought a lot of cake decorating books but if you are looking for a guide to decorating cakes I thouroughly recommend buying a collette peteres or peggy porschen.
Even though this book has a lot of  photo's it provides some information not much and honestly for the price I would prefer to buy a wedding cake magazine.
This book was a dissapointment not very helpful or useful really.
Dated but Valuable Reading
It is amazing that this book is nearly 15 years old, and further that Bill Gates was so spot on with the current technology that we see today.
It is a good read to see both the vision of this truly amazing entrepreneur, as well as to get an idea of how to think about technology enabling daily life.
Listen to what Bill gates says about the future of technology in your life - the past would indicate he knows what he's talking about.
Not the original stories
I must agree with the other reviewers that this set is awful as it does no show the episodes in the original clifhanger form as shown on TV.
I will be the first in line to buy underdog when it is produced as it was ORIGINALLY shown with all the shorts like tennessee tuxedo and commander mcbragg and with the cliffhangers.
Come on guys give us the original show as it should be and this set will fly off the shelves.
Until then you can keep this junk.
Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."
Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.

Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!
I got bit!'
His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Clapton Classics
Very disappointing.
This was advertised to be a "note-for-note" lesson on selected Clapton tunes, and it was not even close.
There was no tab to support the little (and sometime inaccurate) portions of the songs that were listed.
I sent a complaint directly to Hal Leonard, but never received the courtesy of a reply.
Different book. Not the expected original. Parts missing.
I expected the "good night sweet butterflies" book that I had in a largerformat.
Because the book is small, some pages have been cut off, and the text is completely different and much worse than the text of the large book.I am very disappointed with this purchase.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
In the land of the blind...
This piece of literature promises enlightenment but fails to deliver.
Though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection, they fail to impart true understanding.
The initial discourse on love is riveting but what follows quickly descends into empty rhetorical musings which continue until the bitter end.
The most entertaining aspect of this book is the artful use of language which almost masks the fact that the prophet indeed speaks but says nothing.
Book in Shambles When Received
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BOOK FROM Amazon.com LLC .
I ordered this book earlier in the week with Amazon Prime for a going away gift.
I received the book today.
The party is tomorrow.
Half of the book sleeve seems to have been cut off with an exacto knive, also leaving gashes in the book cover.
The packaging was fine.
I could return it but it wouldn't come back before tomorrow.
Spend extra and use another seller.
Fave!
I bought this in LP form when it was brand new, recorded it onto a cassette so I could play it in my car, listened, and listened, and listened.
I have so missed listening to this (no longer have a turn-table) that I've finally reordered it on CD.
YAY!!
Can't wait to play it, and play it, and play it.
No one, absolutely no one wears his heart for God on his sleeve like Keith Green!
I can't wait to meet him in heaven.
It distorts
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it.
Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me.
This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use.
Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
These are my favorite candies ever!
After hearing mixed opinions about these Kit Kats, I decided to try them.
They are excellent, and I do not regret purchasing them at all.
They taste like matcha with a bit of a vanilla and milky flavor as well.
They are not too sweet or too plain.
These are the best Kit Kats I've ever had, and I would recommend them to anyone who likes matcha-flavored candies or anyone wanting to try an unusual kind of Kit Kat.
Booooorrrring
Hated this product.Predictable.
Not fun.
It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.
Often times I thought "this seems like d&d; battle....  Just kidding".
We never played it again after one play through.Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.F
Chocolate Butter Cake
I just multiplied the Chocolate Butter Cake recipe by five to get 30 cups and it turned out PERFECT!!
I spent too much time in the past throwing away batter or cakes because they tasted terrible but this one was the absolute best cake I have ever tried.
The batter tastes like chocolate pudding and the cake itself melts in your mouth.
I will definitely be trying all of the other recipes :)
Heavenly Highway Hymns
Heavenly Highway HymnsI ordered this hymnal because I learned to read shaped note music when I was a teenager.
I play piano but do not sing.
I am 85 years old.
This hymnal has mostof the songs I have learned over the years.
It was exactly what I wanted and needed.It was in good condition and the price was right.
I purchased this book from Amazon.
Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
It works great but I hardly use it.
I got it to have it if I needed it.
I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it.
If I was really good I can see the need.
But this is a keyboard not an organ.
Cannot recommend
I didn't expect this cable to be so thin.
It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used.
Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference.
If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.
Still, it works and was inexpensive.EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.
Wire frayed at the right angle jack.
You get what you pay for.
Unfortunate item.
I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item.
I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.
Cheap product
Cheap product!
Within two days of use it started to loose air where I found a pin size hole and is now no longer useable.
You could buy the same product (also made in china) at local stores for 1/4 the price.
I would not recommend this product.
spend the extra money on a better kit
used it for a year or so and definitely have had to buy better equipment.
the skinny cleaning rod- snapped.. the thicker cleaning rod- also snapped.
i'm not one to apply heavy force on these, they're just very soft/cheap.
the brushes are decent enough.
after spending cash on a nicer kit, i guess i learned my lesson.
if you have the funds skip and buy something a little nicer.
Midway Broadcasting announced today that its Chairwoman, Melody Spann Cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entrepreneurs and executives thrive in business. "The Girlfriend's Guide To Closing the Deal" shares insights on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old-boy's network.
Throughout the book, Spann Cooper uses anecdotal references to deal with challenging issues including the #MeToo movement and Hillary Clinton's Presidential defeat and its impact on fueling the female empowerment in America.
The self-published book is the result of a groundbreaking self-entitled speech that Spann Cooper delivered as a keynote address at The National Association of Women Business Owners Conference in Chicago in 2017. The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal is written in a down-to-earth style that every "girlfriend" can relate.
Christie Hefner, businesswoman and daughter of Playboy Founder, Hugh Hefner, says "The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal" is both highly entertaining and very helpful. Melody weaves together personal anecdotes, triumphs, and setbacks with useful lessons learned. From how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to "friend up," everyone can benefit from Melody's story."
As Chairman of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she joined an elite list of America's female broadcast owners after purchasing the company's controlling interest in 1999. Midway Broadcasting Corporation is a best-in-class female and family-owned media boutique whose properties include radio and interactive platforms.
The book was co-written with T. Shawn Taylor, journalist, writer and founder of Tree Top Consulting, a full-service media consulting firm.
It's OK but I wish I'd bought something else.
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers.
It's cheap and easy to use.
It'll do the job, but I don't like it.
Grooming Notes
As a self trained groomer, this was the best buy I've made in a long time.
It's a wonderful reference guide and it makes my job a whole lot easier.
I can find everything I need if I have questions about a breed or the AKC standards for the breed.
Great set.
I like it but I have to say I wish they included a way to "loop" the band over something to be able to do pull-down or back exercises.
I ended up using the "ankle" attachment to do that and works for me.
Quality is great and would definitely see this lasting me a long time.
I love the carabineer because you can use 2 or more at the same time with the handles once you get stronger.
Had to return...
This pruner does not even remotely cut 1" branches, wet or dry.
Does not cut 3/4" branches.
It may cut SOME 1/2" dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it.
Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.
Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'
A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
"We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
"While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
"Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
"Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?
"We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime."
Too Big.
Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big.
They stand out too much.
They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced.
There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.
Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant.
I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play.
Not cool.
Feathered Phonics volume 1
The CD is a good idea for teaching a bird to speak,but there are words on it that would never be spoken in our home so why teach them to the bird.
I will look through the other choices of CD's and try to find one with different words.
Dunlop The Original CryBaby Pedal
If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a BOSS GT-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.
Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.
Outstanding Concept, and Performances
The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.
Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.
Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.
This is an annual "must watch" story for me.
1960's Classic Comes To This?
Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable.
I cringed when I watched this with my son.
I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes.
This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless.
Oops!
I said Christmas, I meant Happy Holidays!
UGHHHH!!!
The game doesn't save at all and that's really irritating because you can't turn your computer off without it completely deleting your progress.
Also it turns on and off randomly so when you exit the game all of a sudden it pops back up again.
My six year old  thinks it's fun but he gets frustrated with it.
became a mess
Started out as a great road trip activity for my 5 yro  but after the 2 yro used it, it became a mess.
The stix became stuck together or had hairs stuck to them.
It doesn't come with a reusable bag or anything so they are all stuck in a big ball to the top of the book right now - neither my kids nor I want to deal with organizing them.
Get the 13-disc box set from AmazonUK!
$117 on the secondary market for this inferior set?
HA!
Go to AMAZON UK and get the complete 13-disc set in a beautiful box set for about $84 shipped.
(I just received mine!
)It doesn't take Marvin, with a brain the size of a planet, to see which is better.
Good night sweet butterflies
I was very disappointed with the condition of this book.
It was listed as very good, but it was very very used.
I was unable to give it as a gift to my grandson, and had to put it in the thrift shop pile.
Of course I could not consider returning it because the book price was less then postage
Ok,tool does what a regular punch does.
I purchased this thinking maybe I need a special tool to easily pop off my base plates for my magazines, but it does the same as a regular punch tool.
Glock mags are a pain to get the base plates off.
The tool does not really make a difference.
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
Its been grueling work but made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk and today doing agility drills!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
Works great
I have several chargers.
Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each.
Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone.
That is always when you need it most.
This one works well for any of my products.
Worked great for about 5 charges
I used NiCD batteries for a time years ago and gave up on those.
When I tried the NiMH batteries I started with these ones and was very disappointed with the technology, we used it in a mouse that required about twice a week changes, later I changed to Sanyo's eneloop and I'm very happy.
Very handy, works well
I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5, because of the packaging it comes in.
The plastic is sharp & isn't that easy to carry in your bag without stabbing yourself on it, but without the plastic box, the magnifier would get very scratched.
I may discard the plastic box, but keep the magnifier in something soft, like a small sock.
Otherwise, the magnifier works great.
Now I don't have to grow up
I can color right along with my grandchildren, without feeling intellectually compromised at the project.
This book is so amazing that I have used some of the designs for stained glass windows.
I highly recommend this for anyone who does not want to grow out of a favorite pasttime.
Older batteries came out in a plastic case.
Item did not arrive on a cardboard card, it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out.
Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date.
The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item.
They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge.
Great to have so he can play with his alphabet ...
I have a stainless steel refrigerator therefore there are not much space for my son to play with his magnet.
Brought this for him to put his magnet on.
He enjoys sticking his magnet on it.
Great to have so he can play with his alphabet magnets.
