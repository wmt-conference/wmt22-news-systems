I don't care about watching TV anymore because there is such a thing ...
Is it impossible for a geisha?TV is a geisha.
Yesterday I saw a stagger on Netflix, but there were quite a lot of people laughing behind me when I said it was not particularly interesting.
It's obviously not an interesting place, but there's no eerie grin to say, ""I'm a popular geisha, so I'm laughing at everything I'm saying.""
But if you don't laugh at the staff, the mood of the geisha will be impaired, and it's probably not good at working with each other.
Like a black company in the old days, the industry is really a sports meeting, and some geisha's egos are too much and they're usually disliked, so if you don't do that, you won't have to eat.
On the other hand, there are a lot of theories about ""don't lick geisha"" every time the geisha himself feels the hardship of his work.
I know there's a lot less income until it's sold, but the geisha seems to be at the top of the job category with a lot of work.
I can only hear the beautification of my own career and the justification of the fact that laughter artists are too high in the media and society.
To be honest, there are quite a few industries where I work, but I feel that things that touch the world of geisha are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry you're complaining.
I felt that it was not good for the body unless I went out like a masturbation ...

Sample gift to the buyer
Products ordered at Tsukumonnet Shop were replaced freely
Summary: When I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, I received a wired version of the mouse and I was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
It is a mail-order trouble rather than a topic of my own PC, but no matter what you think, it is unconvinced or famous place, so let me write here.
It was discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (linked fish Taku) at the Tsukumo Day Sale at the Tsukumo Net Shop, which started on Friday.
Because the wired version was the same price at the store, I ordered it considering the possibility of a price mistake and considering the possibility of a wired version page, it was 5,071 yen (linked fish Taku) so it was not a mistake.
I received an order e-mail successfully and received an order e-mail the next day.
The name of ""CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS"" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page.
At this point, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would be delivered because there were no errors or cancellation notices between the order and the shipment.
This is a problem, and a few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying ""There was a mistake in registering the product"".
According to the email
The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually a wired version.
Note: I have already shipped a wired mouse.
1.Reject to receive and cancel the reservation completely
2.Mouse Only Returns and Refunds
3. Use wired mouse as is
Choose the response
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version is separated, and even though it is written as the wireless version in the purchase history, e-mail and delivery sheet, it seems that it was voluntarily replaced by the wired version and sent.
If you send something different from the product you bought without understanding, and want to refund it, it's not terrible to send it back here?
In the end, if you want to accept a refund, please lend your wisdom because you want to counterattack one.

Typhoon and heavy rain drain the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple stockpile food <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima TV ) - Yahoo!News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto in the Kokohara area of Yamatsuri-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.
The East Japan Typhoon in 2019 had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto : ""At first, it feels like ""majika"".
The only road leading to the Kokohara area ""Kokohara Bridge"" was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, and 30 residents of 11 households in the area became isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry necessary supplies using JR's iron bridge, which was not normally allowed to pass.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto : ""Usually you can come to the garden, but when you get off the car there, you can take your hand or carry your back and walk across the iron bridge, so I felt the difficulty of transportation and car.""
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and the recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take lessons to take measures.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: ""I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to secure 2 ⁇  3 days.""
Misako Matsumoto : ""I don't know when a disaster will come down to me, not someone else's thing, so I felt once again that it's better to have a little stockpile.""On the other hand, Yamatsuri Town experienced ""unexpected disasters"" where bridges are washed away.
To remember the lessons, the town began its own initiative in 2021.
Dr. Ryuichi Takahashi, Director of the Education Division, Yamatsuri-cho: ""We have made an announcement that we would like to think about preparedness for disaster prevention on October 12 next year and beyond in the form of ""Yatsuri-cho Disaster Prevention Day.""
I think that awareness of the possibility of unexpected things has increased even more than ever.""

Be careful when purchasing a second-hand house!
What is the pitfall of the Building Status Survey System (Diamond Online ) - Yahoo!News
Aiming to revitalize the second-hand housing market The newly established ""Building Status Survey"" system The second-hand housing market has been strong.
The price of houses and condominiums is rising, and the reform market is also on an expanding trend.
In contrast to the increasing home ownership due to the coronal disaster, the popularity of properties such as ""Ekimae Station, Near Station, Direct Station"" ""Large Scale"" and ""Tower"" such as words has been concentrated, and the relatively cheap new buildings have declined sharply.
[Image from this article] However, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still low compared to overseas.
Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) partially revised the Housing Business Act in 2018, and started a survey on the status of buildings aimed at trading used houses in a safe and secure manner (https: /www.mlit.go.jp/common/0012199,900.pdf ).
This is a system in which architects who are well versed in housing check the condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and summarize it in a report and present it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
Sellers can avoid claims after delivery by conducting property surveys before trading, giving buyers a sense of security.
Furthermore, it will lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to grasp the state of used houses they are planning to purchase, and to be able to purchase them in a convincing manner. At first glance, it is a system that has significant advantages.
However, due to the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the leading authority in the investigation of the building status.
In addition, I would like to pay attention to the fact that only the announcement of the inspection system was obligated.
In other words, a real estate agent in charge of the intermediary is obliged to explain that ""When intermediating a property, an architect can introduce a building status survey"" or ""can not"", but the implementation itself is not obligated.
On the other hand, in the United States and the United Kingdom, where second-hand markets are booming, similar systems have already been established.
In the pre-sales phase, buyers are asked to conduct a building survey by an expert called ""Inspector"" or ""Building Surveyor"".
For example, in the U.S., inspections are conducted in 70 ⁇ 90% of used housing transactions, depending on the state.
The main aspect of ""seller"" is Japanese-style inspection and its nature is very different in that ""buyer"" leads the inspection.
The sellers try to show the condition of the building as much as possible, and sell it as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the survey, repair it appropriately, and live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, the objectives and thoughts of both sides have been distorted.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as concerns about Japan's system.
The scope of survey of seller-led inspections set by the government remains minimal.
Because it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of missing a really important problem ● For an inspection company, an intermediary company (seller) that introduces the case in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that ""considerations"" may be conducted, such as not reporting adverse results to sellers.

Was Ginza an island?
5 Miscellaneous Schools (LEON.JP ) - Yahoo!News
""It used to be a peninsula.
In Ginza, it's also possible to show off a little miscellaneous school.
I would like to introduce you to Ginza's knowledge, which is interesting to know and will definitely want to talk to someone.
Go on top of Ginza! ?
First Infiltrated in Kinza
As you walk through Ginza, there are many historical aspects of Ginza, such as its strange name, mysterious stone monument, and many shrines.
When I was walking around Ginza with her, I suddenly came to silence and said, ""This was a peninsula in the past.
Ginza was once a peninsula?
""Ginza"" in Chuo Ward, Tokyo is synonymous with downtown areas that created ""○○ Ginza"" in various parts of Japan.
In the first place, ""Ginza"" is a silver coin casting facility, and in 1612, the Ginza government office located in the present Shizuoka city moved to Edo.
At the time, it was called ""New Exchange Town"", but when it was moved to Kakigara-cho, it was called ""Ginza"".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a peninsula that protrudes into the sea.
From the Edo period until the end of the Edo period, there was an inlet from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and from Nihonbashi to Ginza there was a peninsula called Edomaejima.
The tip of the peninsula is the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and developed the Kyobashi area.
Furthermore, Ieyasu set up a town area and made Horiwari to develop boat traffic.
Then, the moat was scraped into soil and Mt. Kanda to fill the inlet.
In front of Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of ""the birthplace of Ginza,"" which shows the site of the Ginza government office.
Pilgrimage to sacred places in Ginza
Every year, ""Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour"" is held in Ginza.
Of the more than 10 sacred places, the most noticeable is Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za.
Many people visit the shrine at the right end of the Kabuki-za theater before and after the theater.
On the other hand, ""Ryuko Fudoson"" is located on the roof of Ginza Matsuya and ""Ginza Deze Jizoson"" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
""Hodo Inari Shrine"", ""Azuma Inari Shrine"" and ""Toyoiwa Inari Shrine"" are located in the back of the alley and are difficult to see, but ""Toyoiwa Inari Shrine"" is known for the reverence of the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Hasaemon and ""Successful Inari Shrine"" at the entrance on the 1st floor of Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
Some shrines worship Fudomyoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most shrines worship Inari.
""Inari-sha"" welcomed by foxes in front of the shrine hall was built in a mandarin orange for the benefit of ""fifth-grain rich harvest"" where many farmers often produce rice.
It turned out that in big cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it is said that business prosperity benefited, and faith spread in Ginza, one of Japan's best business districts.
What do you think of a person who returned home without being vaccinated?
It will not be good.
This is because there are many cases where omikron strains are infected even twice inoculated.
It must be said that it is a slight action.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist's office because of the painful pain of the front teeth when they were pressed or touched, which made me feel irritable.

South Korea Posco International Acquires Australia's Senex Energy to Expand its Gas Field Business in Australia (WoW!Korea ) - Yahoo!
Posco International announced on December 12, that it has signed a share acquisition agreement with Senex Energy, Australia, and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, the acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March next year, with the approval of the CENEX Energy shareholders' meeting and the approval of local subsidiaries remaining.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The acquisition amounted to KRW 770.9 billion, of which POSCO International decided to invest 50.1% and Hankook Energy 49.9% respectively.
Posco International explained that demand for natural gas will continue to increase even during the energy transition era, and that blue hydrogen, which is a natural gas base, will split the market together with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves (802Bcf), equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as human resources to operate land gas fields in Australia.

That knee pain, perhaps ""Osteoarthritis"" may be! ?
Medical DOC (Depending on the Cause) - Yahoo!News
Editorial Department: Recently, knee pain continues.
What is the potential of the disease?
Mr. Maruyama: Knee joint pain is caused by various factors such as injury, rheumatoid arthritis, gout attacks, etc.
Among them, most Japanese people are osteoarthritis.
Edit: Does the joint deform?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joints is covered with cartilage, which relieves impact and smooths joint movement.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can be worn down or distorted.
As a result, it leads to joint deformation and inflammation.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis develop other than knees?
Professor Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the base, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the feet, the hip joint, etc.
However, the most common cases occur in the knee, which is called osteoarthritis.
Editorial Department: In the first place, what is the structure of joints?
Mr. Maruyama: In the joints, two bones are combined with unevenness.
The two faces are covered with ""arthral cartilage"", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped in ""arthral wrap"".
Editor: It's a complex structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes, that's right.
In the inner layer of the joint follicle, there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which makes joint fluids.
This joint is a lubricant, composed of hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate.
Hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements.
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Arthral cartilage is tenacious and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bone and bone from hitting directly.
In other words, it plays a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn down or distorted, it can cause pain by deforming or inflaming the joints.

3 Gambling & Games in the Kaiji Series (Real Sound) - Yahoo!News
""Kaiji"" series, a gambling manga that boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the real pleasures of this film is the extreme games that put their lives on.
[Photo] Just looking at it, your feet will scoop up ... ...Challenge iron bone crossing!
So this time, I would like to verify the game of Kaiji that can actually be played or is put into practice in the planning video.
■Numa This is a trap-packed pachinko ""Numa"" that appeared in ""Kaiji, the Record of the Gambling Breaking Commandments"".
In the original work, he surprised Kaiji at a high rate of 4,000 yen per ball.
This swamp has a large trap of ""Nail Forest"", ""Movement Actors"", and ""Three-stage Crew"", and it was thought that the attack was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used all his hands, and in the end, he put a vinyl tank in the building and dipped the ground.
""Numa"" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as ""4000 yen per ball"" and the difficulty is also reduced, but you can taste the feeling of Kaiji.
■Steel crossing The ""Starside Party"" was held by the rich man as an entertainment, and the ""Human Race"" was held by the debtors including Kage.
The debtors compete for speed by devising measures not to fall on the thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.""
12 people participate and the top two can win the prize, but there are only four steel frames, safety measures are insufficient, and the likelihood of death is quite high.
This iron-frame crossing is dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game, and you can experience it very close to the Eagle Bridge at Rakuten Life Park Miyagi, the home of professional baseball and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
The Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and there is a single bridge with steel bones.
Of course, safety measures are being implemented.
Koara Koarashi, a comedian of comedy, released a video of the Eagle Bridge walking on his YouTube channel saying, ""You can experience iron-frame crossing in Japan.""
■E-card Two-player card game, ""E-card"".
A total of 10 cards of the emperor, 8 of the citizens, and 1 of the slaves are used to play, divided into Emperor and Slave.
The game is very good, the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji confronts Tonegawa with a strict rule that ""if he loses, he can shave his ears.""
Kage realizes that the device that destroys the ear like earphones attached to the ear in the end is read psychologically by sensing and transmitting changes in pulses and body temperature, etc.Kage confuses the Tone River by cutting his ear to the extreme and making the body abnormal, winning.
E-cards are on the market and can be purchased on Amazon etc.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru posted a video with Fujiwara Tatsuya, who played Kaiji in the movie, and E-card winning, and drew a lot of attention.
■ Have you ever tasted a Cajji feel?
I don't want anyone to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read manga, you will taste only your mood.
Why don't you feel the world through the game?
New Year's Day ⁇  Yamagata Shimbun
At Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), which is preparing for the New Year, a large ema of Tora, the Chinese zodiac, appeared next year.
The Tohoku University of Art and Technology students, who designed the shrine, visited the shrine on November 11, and held a memorial service in front of the shrine.
Since last year, the shrine has been requesting students of art and technology to create original paintings of ema.
This time, the works of Yui Tsuchiya (22) were selected from among the nine artists of the Japanese Painting Course of the Department of Fine Arts directed by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large horse is 3.3 meters wide, and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya says she drew ""the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing back on her back to a new year.""
The tiger stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms with the hope that ""Even in a rapidly changing world, we can afford to see the beauty of nature.""
The design of the Tsuchiya is also drawn on the ema, which is commonly distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonnegi said, ""I think it will help all people overcome difficulties.""

Let's think about ""Tamano who wants to continue to live"" Recommendation 4 high school students workshop in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital ⁇ Sanji
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about ""I want to continue living in Tamano.""
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai Development Center, an intermediary support organization, young people's voices will be summarized and proposed to the mayors.
When do you have fun?
Students will answer questions from facilitators, such as ""When you're excited with a lot of people"" and ""When you're playing drums"".
It was the first time that it was held at Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13.
With 18 high school students and local people talking about the theme of ""island"" while traveling, I thought about ""interesting town"" ""living town"" ""living town"" ""living town"".
Each idea is written on a sticky note, pasted on imitation paper, and arranged.
A town with a lot of young people seems to be interesting"" ""To make it easier to live, transportation such as trains and buses is essential.
There is no commonality, and we will discuss it further.
""I thought Tamano was boring, but it was attractive to be able to cycling on the beach,"" says a student (18 ) from Tamano High School of Commerce.
""There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it is good to have a place rich in nature,"" said a third-year student of Binan High School (18).
In December, the second session was held only for high school students, and the contents of the proposals were summarized.
In February of next year, the mayor and the principal of education will be invited to give a presentation.
Mr. Torie, President of the Center, said, ""I hope this will foster the local love of high school students and serve as an opportunity for young people to take a leading role in urban development.""

How to find Stole (Sankei Shimbun ) - Yahoo!ニュース
It is an essential stall in winter, but is there a time when the cloth sticks to the neck?
After winding, it is good to look at the mirror and balance it, but I sometimes hear the voice that I do not know the trick.
I thought that if there was a stall that didn't hold the cloth, I could wrap it quickly...I found something novel.
The stole of the brand ""COTTORI"" is about 1 meter long, and has a more compact size than the general one.
When I first saw it, ""Can I wind it so short?""
If you look closely, it is made into one piece by knitting a thin, cut cloth, and the whole is a net shape.
The ends of the stole can be seen through the net.
Therefore, it is possible to wrap it up without connecting the end to the end.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, even if you wear a jacket, the sleeveless gilet (best) is popular, but many people will wear it in combination with a stall so that the shoulders do not cool.
If you have such a stall, I think it will be convenient.

Beetle's documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
Get Buck, directed by Peter Jackson.
It's like a life-size Beatles, and it's so fresh...
It's just before the dissolution, so I'm doing it, but it's not as dramatic as I imagined.
I'm trying my best to sort it out and say, ""I know I'm pretty, but I'm good at it!""I'm sorry Paul, ""But I'm good at it"", George, who's a little bit shy, or John, who's not willing to do it late while calmly saying opinions or jokes, etc...I'm not actively talking about apples that role, and I'm sitting in the back with my face saying ""I'm in trouble"".
I don't like each other so much that I fight, but I have a feeling that there is a feeling in the atmosphere that ""Well, I can't work together anymore"", and the Beatles was like that It is interesting to say that it is a dismantling of the legend.
And when you start playing in such an atmosphere, everyone is really full of talent.
The process of creating ""that masterpiece"" while each other is doing ""What is this?"" from a little phrase is swaying.
Especially, the moment when the title ""Get Buck"" is completed is amazing
"A nasal song like a casual Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun Hun H
It's amazing to see the process of composing in such a way.
It's also natural, but everyone gets fat, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems to be one story in three stories yet, but the biggest reason for the dissolution is that it was the environment around the Beatles itself.
When the four of us complained, but when we started making a song, it seemed to be fun, but when we talked about where to live, it was easy to understand that producers and propaganda people were saying, ""The Beatles are the best in the world!""
Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, since Paul seems to be supervised, I thought that it might be because there are many scenes where Paul is rather evil.

Large damage caused by tornadoes in the United States The effects of unseasonably warm and strong cold (weather news ) - Yahoo!News
From the 10th (Friday) night to the 11th (Saturday) local time, many tornadoes occurred mainly in the south of the United States.
At this time, strong cold air southwards where it was record warmth made the atmospheric condition very unstable, and the cumulonimbus clouds are thought to have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed from the southwestern part of the United States to record high temperatures.
The highest temperatures in Houston, Texas, on Thursday, 9th and Friday, 10th, have risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
In such a record warm place, strong cold air below -30°C in the sky around 5,500 m was falling south, so active fronts were formed due to large temperature differences, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes appear to have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
Southern U.S. is an area that is prone to tornadoes, but during the high season from early summer to summer, there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The tornado alert, announced in a day in winter, reached nearly 150 times, a record high.
The U.S. Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusts on Friday 10th local time alone.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale) shows the strength of the tornado, reaching the third EF3 from the strong of the six stages, and it is thought that a gust of around 70 m/s was blowing instantaneously.
Depending on the future survey, it may be judged as EF4 ⁇ 5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version improved Fujita scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale to match the situation of Japanese buildings, etc.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the U.S. this time, is likely to occur in Japan too, and it is a level where wooden houses collapse.

U.S. Tornado ""The Largest in History"" Live Broadcasting Calls for Help (Daily Sports ) - Yahoo!ニュース
With regard to tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, U.S. President Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time ) as ""one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history"".
CNN TV and others reported.
""We do everything as a federal government,"" Biden stressed.
I still don't know how many lives have been lost.
More than 100 people were feared dead.
[Photo] More than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six provinces, including Kentucky, from night 10 to early 11 October.
A total of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of tornado damage was recorded in Missouri and other provinces in 1925, but CNN's weather experts estimate that this time it was the largest in size at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was severe, a candle factory that was in operation 24 hours a day in preparation for a Christmas business battle was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and the ruins disappeared.
In the dark, a woman who couldn't move under a thick rubble of about 1.5 meters felt the weight of the rescuer who searched for it on the debris, and asked for help via Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of women calling for help, the live broadcast also echoed the song of ""Happy Birthday to You,"" which is thought to have been screaming and another woman singing in tears to distract fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of his home with his five-year-old son because of a tornado alert.
There were many people who could compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrible sound like a ground sound that something erupted more.
""We will continue to search until we no longer need to,"" said a police officer at Mayfield.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will be.""
In Illinois, at least six deaths were confirmed due to a partial collapse of Amazon's warehouse, a major Internet mail-order retailer.
In addition to derailing due to the impact of the train's vehicle being disconnected, highways have been blocked one after another due to vehicle falls.
According to the U.S. web media, a total of 400,000 power outages have occurred, including 130,000 homes in Tennessee.

It is a discourse that the way of thinking about the star system is different from the past.
In contrast to the five-star ratings in other countries, Japan insists that the three-star ratings will be neutralized and added/decreased.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and the four stars are completely different in terms of ""There is a subtraction element"" and ""It is not a masterpiece but a good work"".
Based on the five stars, ""works with no faults"" and ""works with the highest standards in all"" will be in line, so if you tend to do that, it will be a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of stars, but you say that you do not need to put three stars (deprecated reviews) because it is currently being operated in such a system.
Therefore, if you try to refute those who insist on this discourse with Steam's two-choice evaluation, the story becomes uncompromising.

Bento ""Seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried homemade tartar sauce""
""hakobune"" is a takeout specialty shop of colorful bento boxes and deli (sosai) using plenty of vegetables.
Katsuki Takayuki (39 ) ・ Arimi (38) and his wife opened the restaurant in August last year, saying, ""I hope you can enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant at home.""
One of the popular bento dishes is ""Seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried homemade tartar sauce"" (1000 yen).
Fish choose good things from time to time in the market.
""Flying makes raw bread crumbs as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients,"" says Takayuki.
There are about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli on the lunch box, and rice and soup with millet are added to the divided rice of Hinohikari from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are homemade in buckwheat fields, and they are purchased at direct sales offices in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki is trained in French, and Lape and Latatouille add color.
On the other hand, it has a blend of Japanese and Western flavors that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as the ""flavored taste familiar to eating"" (Arimi-san).
The bento ""Tegone Hamburger"" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the Charcuterie Set, a meat processing product that goes well with wine and other sake, will also be released.

Riding comfort It is not so bad, but sometimes shakes (not as drunk as it is)
Speed of course slow
Safety I think it's safe because people around me slow down their speed, and sometimes they stop completely, but I think it's dangerous depending on the location.
Looking Around It is painful, it is good to be seen, but it is painful to be seen in the feeling that ""It is disturbing"".
General review It was not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
Unfortunately, it will be easier to use if there are fewer people or considerations such as getting them to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good if I made a dedicated lane, so as not to disturb other people walking.
However, because I was relaxing, I could relax while looking at the scenery, so I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little less people.
In the future, I wonder if this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream.It was a difficult ride unless it was a very patient mind owner, because the excitement of the near future feeling and the pain of the surrounding eyes were comfortable.
I was ashamed of it.

A Long Way for a Family to Root Environmental Protection Activities in China (JBpress ) - Yahoo!News
(Yuki Kato, Corporate Consultant, Find Asia, Hong Kong) China, which has a vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity.It is the world's largest mammalian species and the world's third largest plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity, and some local governments not only promote environmental protection, but also promote activities of environmental activists.
Located in the southwestern part of China, Yunnan Shisapanna (Xishuangbanna) is one such area.
Shisapanna is a region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "" ⁇ "" tribe that shares its roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River flowing through Southeast Asian countries flows.
Shisapanna Thai (Xishuangbanna) Autonomous Region The area of Shisapanna is only 0.2% of the whole of China, but it is home to about 25% of wild animals and 20% of plants.
This time, I met Mr. Li Min-Hua, an environmental conservation worker in Sisapanna, and talked about the activities.
■ Start environmental protection activities with the German husband ― It has been 20 years since we started environmental protection activities.
What was the reason for this?
Mr. Lee Our environmental protection activity ""Tenaz"" started its activities in 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband, from Germany, came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China, boasting one of the most biodiversity-rich.
On the other hand, economic development was delayed.
Therefore, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests has progressed in the past in order to root the industry in the region and to produce rubber that had been lacking in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And I got to know and got married with me who was a reporter here.
Before that, did you have any interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Lee I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of rainforests and the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, I decided to promote the project with my husband.
Sometimes I see people with auras, even though they don't have good faces and are not special tall, why do you think?

I don't think it's fine.

Did you praise it in detail?
What would you do if you confessed to Sakura Yokomine?
I confessed to Sakura, and my heart is in full bloom in spring.
And to get to know each other, I would like to increase my golf knowledge and share what I like.
I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at the time I want to open it later?

There is no fee, so we recommend opening a NISA account simultaneously so that you can use it as soon as you want to use it.

[Omakan/Personal Memorandum] It took about a month and a half to identify CTD in MOD's own environment.
Until March, CTD was occurring due to multiple factors as the stable data was not much time to play around GW, and it took a while to identify a little bit only at the center of the holiday.

Thinking about the importance of psychiatric visit nursing – Today's visit nursing is over
Because I have bipolar disorder, I have been visiting nursing for a long time, but I think that my relationship with nurses (women) at the visiting nursing station that I am currently using has become longer, and I think that I can build a very good relationship.
Every week, I'll talk a lot.
Of course, I will do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but above all, I thought about how important it is to have fun communication for people with mental illness in today's visiting nursing care.
Today, I talked about sex differences between men and women, and I talked about gender theory.
I also talk about the sexual desire of men and women, why did she divorce, and how should she do visiting nursing?
Sometimes, I'm dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of a visiting nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, I heard from an acquaintance that a grandmother nurse who was unable to work in the ward had to come and respond administratively, or that a occupational therapist came to the hospital for visiting nursing, but from the viewpoint of such things as ""This is because we are doing medical care.""
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think it's a really good nurse who confronts Frank as well as me with mental illness.
By the way, she is a beautiful woman.
Some of you may be taking psychiatric visit nursing, and others may be thinking about receiving it.
Visiting nursing is very useful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves it, please take it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.

Hydrogen Technology Patent in South Korea, one-fifth of China ... ""Delayed to Implement Hydrogen Economic Roadmap"" ( 中央日本語版 ) - Yahoo!
In 2019, the Korean government released a hydrogen economic roadmap.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles were introduced and 310 hydrogen stations were operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was 6,000 won per kilogram (about 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units).
Hydrogen stations for core infrastructure are 38% (about 117 sites), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is 8400 won, which is not much different from the time of the road map was released.
The government's implementation of the hydrogen economic roadmap was significantly below its target.
The National Federation of Economic Coalitions (Zenkeiren) released a report on the current state and policy direction of the hydrogen economy, on March 12.
According to the report, the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, which is the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), membranes by Dupon (USA), Gore (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of patents for hydrogen technology in six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by 14% annually since 2014.
Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the hydrogen production and fuel cell fields (as of 2014-2020).
However, Zenkeiren said, ""In fact, six countries make up the majority of the world's hydrogen market, which actually means lower among competitors.""
Patent rankings by country are China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the U.S. and ranked first, and the gap has been widening.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Korea reached 1033, surpassing that in Japan (974), while the number of patents registered in China (4721) reached 22%.
Hydrogen technology should be designated as a ""national strategic technology"" with a large amount of tax deductions for capital investment and R&D expenses.

Is it a crime for a shop to sell things higher than a fixed price?
Today, PS5 was sold at the store for 70,000.
It is legal.
Because it is a free competition, for example, if a brand item has a rarer value than a fixed price, etc.
For example, it is legal for a painter to become famous and raise the price.
Ps5 is sold at a high price, which is also a rare value, and it's just a rise in value over a fixed price.

Parliament on Sunday?
Establishment of leaflets like a TV program In Takasu, parliamentary reform is underway, the ""Communication Book"" of members is also:Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as the creation of strange flyers that guide the holding of regular meetings, and the introduction of a ""communication book"" where townspeople evaluate members.
The aim of the town's election is to raise interest in the townspeople, with no votes for three consecutive years.
On the 9th, about 1,800 new flyers were distributed in newspapers to publicize the Sunday Congress held on the 12th.
""From morning to raw guillon"" "" Tetsuko's room"" "" Sawaguchi Hitoshi Expedition Series"" ...
The flyer, which was distributed to all the houses by the town council on the 9th, is a word reminiscent of a popular TV program name.

U.S. arrives at Ukraine for aid weapons ammunition (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo!News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that by the 12th, equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine based on a security aid plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid is worth 60 million dollars (about 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars that identify launch sites such as mortars, will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
These aids also included lethal weapons, such as the anti-tank missile javelin, according to Carby Press Secretary of the Department of Defense.
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen the defense capabilities of Ukraine, which has been affected by the Russian military's expansion of military forces around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. has been vigilant about the Russian military's moves, consulted with NATO members, and has been drafting measures to deal with Russia's invading Ukraine.
On September 1 this year, President Biden approved weapons aid when Ukrainian President Serensky visited the U.S. White House.
The U.S. military support to Ukraine reached around $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forced annexation of the Crimea Peninsula in Ukraine, the total amount of assistance has risen to more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in Ukrainian military training missions.
Last month a U.S. Florida National Guard was dispatched in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan to support Ukraine.
According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense, the European Special Operational Forces also play a major role in training and advice of Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of U.S. Special Forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a secret to the operation.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on July 7, but a tense exchange was also held in Ukraine.
In the event of an invasion, the U.S. is poised to impose severe economic sanctions.

Inheritance and gift tax ""review"" that prohibits pre-birth gifts, direct hit Amari Akira, former president of the LDP.
The first feature of ""Weekly Diamonds"" issue on December 18th is ""Talking with your family during the year-end and new year!
It is ""Prenatal gifting and running inheritance.""
While discussions on the integration of inheritance and gift tax have progressed, concerns about the revision of the 2022 tax system have been made.However, in the near future, there is a great possibility that prenatal gifts, which is the royal road for inheritance tax measures, will become ""prohibited"".
How will the rule of inheritance change?
Together with a direct strike to the LDP's former President of Tax Control and Member of the House of Representatives Akira Amari, the awarding and inheritance basic key-to-tax-saving techniques will be conveyed in time.
(Keiaki Miyahara, Diamond Editor)
""From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale examination toward the establishment of a tax system neutral to the selection of the time of asset transfer"" - .
In the statement of the 2021 tax reform outline announced last year by the ruling party, there has been a great disturbance not only among asset managers but also the middle class.
This is because it means that the inheritance tax will be greatly increased by changing the rules of inheritance and making the ""pre-birth gift"" the king of inheritance tax measures ""prohibited"".
The iron rule for tax-saving measures for progressive inheritance tax is to ""reduce assets subject to taxation"".
The strongest trump card, pre-birth gift, has been widely used not only by asset holders, but also by employees who have a home in the three metropolitan areas where inheritance tax is incurred at a small amount.
Against this backdrop, the discussion on the ""integration of inheritance tax and gift tax.""
Although it was seen in the 22nd fiscal year tax reform outline announced on December 10 that the fastest introduction was concerned, ""Reviewing the current heir settlement taxation system and the calendar year gift system"" ""Since the tax-free measure of gift tax is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limits of the limit, we will revise the policy without permission.""
In an interview with the editorial department, Mr. Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP's former tax system survey, says.
""It is most important to lose advantage and disadvantage due to the time of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same whenever you go.
At present, I'm doing a simulation of what kind of problems will arise through integration.""
Even if this is not the case, in the near future, there will be no doubt that it will be a big deal to invalidate the prenatal gift as a tax-saving measure.
So, how will the rules of inheritance and gift tax change specifically?

My Right Brother"" Yudai Furukawa ""Please look forward to it!
The original FOD drama ""My Right Brother"" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from late at night on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Hanajun Yamatani, a heroine character This work based on the same name manga by Moriesatoshi, which has been serialized in ""BE LOVE"" of Kodansha since 2018, is an overly pure love story of men and women carrying the past.
Furukawa serves as the protagonist, and Yamatani Hanajun serves as the heroine's rationale.
Rise, a university student, meets Kairi, a senior at a part-time job.
Umiri, who is suffering from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep comfortably if he borrows his shoulder for some reason.
Rise is attracted to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to his older brother who died out from his parents' divorce, but is there a chance that Kairi is murderer?
Comment from Yudai Furukawa The drama ""My Right Brother"" will be broadcast on the ground wave from January 10th!
I hope that those who have not been able to see it at FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to learn more about the complex psychological depictions of the ocean and the world, as well as the struggles and changes of the two people.
I would be happy if fans of the original can enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

【NFL】A Team Winning 3 Game Passes How did the players feel (BBM Sports ) - Yahoo!ニュース
In this game, Jones threw only three passes to Patriots.
This was a small number of times since Bills recorded two passes against New York Jets in the third week of 1974, on the NFL in the last 50 years.
In 1974, Bills had O.J. Simpson, the world's first RB over 2000 yards in history.
Bills overwhelmed Jets at Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton run.
The weather was the biggest reason that Patriots developed such an extreme offensive this time.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, not unlike Kushiro in Hokkaido at latitude.
On this day, the temperature was almost 1 degree Celsius, wind speeds of 18 m were blowing, and snow was blowing before the game.
Bills was only local and didn't change a lot of play choices.
There were 25 runs compared to 30 passes.
Allen passes 15/30 and 145 yards.
I didn't have an intercept, and it wasn't bad.
In the 10 offensive series, there were four red zone intrusions and a scoring machine.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, I went to the red zone for three consecutive times.
However, only three FGs were allowed in the three rounds.
Defence before the goal in the final game.
Bills, who followed the four points, made a penalty in 3rd & 9th and reached 3rd & 14th.
The goal was 18 yards.
At 3rd & 14th, QB Allen flowed right out of the pocket, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defenses.
He threw a pass for TE Doson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stepon Diggs, who was outside the right, ran through Sharo-Across and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen didn't get into the eye.
4th & 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran out of the left in the end zone, but the pass was hit by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant and failed.
Bryant had one-to-one covered Bills' WR Call Beathley, but on the way he saw Allen's movement and released the Beathley and reacted to the path.
After losing the two receivers, Allen threw a pass to the end zone twice.
The 4th down path might have been decided, but the 3rd down didn't have to aim for a TD.
You can take the first down by playing two times.
It was still in front of 2 Minutes, so if you put it on 4th & Shorts, Allen's ability to have his own run should have lived.

Sponge
No matter how often you change, sponges are probably not replaced as often as recommended.
According to a 2017 study, even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in microwave ovens every day, a lot of bacteria are found to breed (although it is still recommended to sterilize in the range).
German researchers in this study recommend replacing sponges once a week to keep them clean.
Cutting Board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture points out that when scratching begins, scratches and grooves are formed, cutting boards should be replaced.
Once the wounds and grooves progress, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria breed.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water frequently with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleaching solution.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and place it for a few minutes.
Simply rinse with clean water, cut and dry water so that it can be dried naturally or lightly tapped with a clean paper towel.
Missing or cracking tableware
Disposing your favorite mug may hurt your chest, but the surface that is missing becomes a new hotbed of bacteria and bibacteria.
In addition, it can cause the lips to be cut and the drink to spill in the missing part.

I am ashamed to have a branded product for some reason.
If you have something that is not noticeable, you can hold it, but you can't have it written Lv in a monogram like Vuiton.
Why is it so?
I think it is good to match your height.
By the way, I think it's good in Japan.
In Japan, that's right.
It has nothing to do with the Gaijin style.
It's better to say it early, ""Why am I the only one to call me away?""
So if you're a foreigner, it's better to simply say it's uncomfortable.
Maybe I don't think it's a dream to be uncomfortable with a good probability.
I was living abroad on the way, but the Japanese who went outside, including me, had misunderstood that there were people who didn't like the upper and lower Confucianism, and whether the Taga was out there or not, they could say anything to the local people.
If it looks like a Westerner, I don't think it's purely bad, but I think it's done with a kind of sweetness or a kind of shy feeling.
If my friend is a Westerner, I'm calling it out under the name below, but when I talk in Japanese, there's a moment when I'm a little lost.
Well, if you are a friend, it's still good.
I wonder if it's just purely normal, but it's better to say it now because it may not work for the exceptional treatment that if you miss it, it's Gaijin.
Because it is in Japan, I wonder if you can talk with Japanese rules.
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always make a glass higher than other older people when they toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do it, you can't be strangely treated like a Japanese person, whether you're younger or older.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are people who look at such details (including me) because they are fucking.

I think the translated text feels a bit strange to the text, but I know what I want to convey, and there is no obstacle to the play (I think it's better to ask others just by feeling this way).
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that if it were a small company, it would be well translated.
I think that it is possible for non-native Japanese people to understand the difference between fine nuances of Japanese language even if they study for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if the Japanese are looking for a level that doesn't feel uncomfortable, it's a good idea to look for others.

Consideration ""The Blade of Demolition"" training is the battle.
""Equivalent Exchange of Efforts"" is a human hymn.(QJWeb Quick Japan Web ) - Yahoo!News
Among recent boy cartoons, ""The Blade of Demonishment"" is particularly different from ""There are a lot of training"".
There is almost no battle, and it is a theory that the reader's popularity is not favorable for training in the morning or evening.
In the same jump manga ""ONE PIECE"", I had two years of training when the straw had to be separated, but I guess it was because I painted only the touch and the rest was flying vigorously.
Well, Wampi is one of the charms of the exotic nature of the migratory land, ""Stay in the same place and train"" sometimes does not go well.

It's an inexhaustible exchange of narration among fans at first glance.
However, it is possible that taking her sister, who has become a demon, may be a moment when she is forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that it is an initiation to practice from a mental posture.
However, it is said that the Doujin charcoal Jiro, who has not trained yet, will be taken to Sagiriyama and will descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is full of traps, pitfalls and trebuchets on the thin air, so let's die before we start training.
Nevertheless, it is barely the ""main character correction"" to sniff out the faint smell of the crocodile that was served by people with a sharp sense of smell in his possession and somehow avoid it.
So suddenly I can avoid it all, I don't suddenly get higher in my physical ability! !!
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and the only thing that wakes up is to use the ""power and skills that have been honed up until then"" with their original potential.
""Equivalent Exchange of Effort"" is a human anthem different from a demon who has an unfounded superlative power, and it is a rule that is consistent with this work.
This is the old?
It's not a bed yet, but it's a way of sleeping by laying a mat directly in the house, sleeping with a blanket and quilt.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I'm doing that too.
If you want to use the room widely, it is better to lay a futon and sleep more than a bed.
I think there are many such people.
Is it tight?
If you work as a part-timer, and have a hangover with other stores that you want to work full, is it hard?
No, I don't think so.
In such a case, I don't think it's a ""groomed"" thing.
Somehow, I think it's ""graceful"" to try to make a profit more than effort with minimal effort.
Are there any non-smoking outpatients around the country now?
I'm doing it everywhere.

Following Samsung's integration of CE and IM as a set division, the company decided to name DX (Device eXperience) and reflect it in the organization reform at the end of the year.
Through a wide range of services, from mobile to home appliances, the aim is to enhance user experience.
Samsung Electronics announced that the newly launched DX division, which integrates CE and IM, will consist of VD (Visual Display), consumer electronics, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network.
""This name change reflects medium- to long-term business structure, future-orientedness, and strengthening global leadership,"" a Samsung Electronics official said.
In addition to products such as televisions, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, the company also emphasized its intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect the needs of their customers.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, the company's strategy to create synergies on a company-wide scale, and to build a foundation for differentiated products and services, was also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy to enable users to freely use content and services through the ""MDE and Multi Device Experience Council"" through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

I think it should be.
What do you care about?
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking from an ant's perspective?
I wonder if that is the case.
If you translate the armoured heads into a disc-shaped head, you think that the part that ""is a giant beast wearing a helmet on the scale of an ant"" will disappear ...

Oginuma Xのキン肉マンレビュー【コミックス第4巻 】 ( 週プレNEWS ) - Yahoo!ニュース
The 20th Superhuman Olympic Games, which began in volume 3, are completed in volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which drew all the way from the opening to the semi-finals, we focused only on one game, but it is full of new devices because!
●『キン肉マン』Vol.4 Review Poster Name Oginuma X★★★★(5 in 5 stars) ●Super Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, this volume is one of the carefully drawn finals of Kinniku Man vs Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it is not just about the game on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, we can't get into the game much different from what we had done until then, such as the battle due to mutual restraints and the special training scene, but that's not boring.
This feeling of tension gradually increases as the first battle of the century begins, and it certainly leads to an increase in the tension of the reader, and I am deeply impressed that it is a truly calculated production even during this period.
And before the important final, another mountain, you cannot miss the 3rd place final of Terryman vs Ramenman.
In addition to the gorgeousness as an opponent's card, what I like is the ramen man behind the scenes before the game, ""From now on, I'll turn around!""
And try to beat the chop.
However, when Terry Man happens to pass by, he accepts the sword and stops it, and is caught in silence, and the scene is that it just separates it.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already lost, and there's no chance of fighting a Kin-nikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a one agony to wear around that Kin meat man.
If you can show it like this, you have to think about the activities of the distant future!
As a manga artist, I still feel the pain of being a character!
The battle between the two ends without breaking down the scale, but the famous scene is the complaint of the ramen man's tears after the match.
Do not rely solely on the strength of God's luck!
That's the phrase.
This is already a grand meta statement about the work itself, and so far, readers have never lost it because it is the main character, and I think it feels like they are somehow winning in places that are not capable.
However, by letting the ramen man make this statement, Yude Tamago sensei has stabbed the yogi before himself and no longer able to use that hand.
In this word, the reader said, ""Well, do you think the Kin meatman will defeat Robin with his ability?
How?""
You will be able to imagine the invisible development in the future, and if you look at it from another artist's perspective, this is the same kind of dialogue that Yude Tamago sensei put on himself to make a work.
I thought this was a great thing.
I think it is definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend in Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture ) ( FBC Fukui Broadcast ) - Yahoo!News
The first winter illumination begins at the Aobayama Haval Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, and the park is surrounded by gentle light.
(Dec. 12) The winter illumination, which began on Nov. 26th, is sprinkled with 50,000 LED lights to match the 20-meter tall camphor tree, walking paths and lawns.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, ""I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there is such a place.
It was very beautiful, and I was relieved.""
The illumination was planned for the first time to feel healing while avoiding the crowds, and it was lit from 5pm to 8:30pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday until December 25.
On the last day of the festival, on the 25th, there will also be a Christmas event where the behavior of the button pot and a movie screening will be held.

I'm sorry this morning.
The power of the NAS PC is no longer turned on 😉 ðŸTM'
What happened ⁇
1.) In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
At this time, during the PC transmission.
2.) When I returned to my room after a little while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from my PC and shut down immediately.
At this point, I thought that the lower room temperature (6°C) made the fan move worse.
So I warmed up the room and decided to try again.
3.) Do not start.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is attached and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say anything.
I pull off the power plug and try again, but after all it only takes a moment.
4.) Connect only the motherboard with ATX20 pin and 4 pin, remove other parts and try it out without booting up.
5.) It seems that PSU fans have hit something before, so I suspect that PSU is the cause because there was a sound called ""bububububububububububububu"".
I found the ATX power supply and tried it later.
Maybe it is.
If you can't, what should you do?
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm not sure what to do.
Have you seen a wild rabbit recently (within the last four or five years)?
Where did you see it?
Are you surrounded by nature?
I live in Tohoku.
There are everywhere near us.
It is also in the garden and the parking lot of the company.

First, it accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
The first, third, and fifth-place cry laughter emoji is very easy to use.
When it was interesting, of course, when I was happy, I did it!
There are not many people who use it atrocities even when they feel that it doesn't matter.
On the other hand, people who have never used the top 10 emoji once are rare.
I want that style to go through.
