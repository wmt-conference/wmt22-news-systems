The application will help equip workshops. For points gained by movement
Equip the woodworking workshop of the Hodonín Integrated School with new hand tools. Everyone who downloads the EPP Help with movement application to their mobile phones can now deserve this.
"You collect points with your movement, which you then add to our project's account. You don't have to be a competitive runner or cyclist, points are added even if you go for a walk or go shopping, go for a walk or walk to work," said Eva Schmidová, director of the Hodonín school. The project was among the most interesting of the huge number of other requests for the ČEZ Foundation. The application will be active for one month only.
The big comeback of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the substitutes' bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was replaced exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
He was recalled from the farm on Sunday morning US time, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The student of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not play a single game in the pandemic-shortened year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, his save success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille on the Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported about it on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile at their country home in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a veil over his face, helps Camille put on her veil, which is color coordinated with the light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got access to part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt behavior.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, figures mainly.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal behavior, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked last year in mid-October by a police intervention at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but basically of a worse type (the gunners have to carry cartridges from the armored cabin by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it was already possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. The Gemini with Will Smith did not take the criticism seriously
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will play a younger version of himself in the film. But according to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute top in his field. It kills efficiently and without any unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang his career on a nail. Understandably, his employers don't like this, and they send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or rather a younger DNA clone of him. Can one determined man win the battle over himself? Literally this time.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee should have been a sure guarantee of quality. Although this is his first sci-fi, he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Riding with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous one is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first reviews, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved in it. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," summed up his opinion Stephen Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly lackluster action film," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"A confused product born of a bizarre idea," summed up the film in her review by IndieWire's Ella Kemp.
"It's hard to care about one man being the other's doppelgänger when neither is acting human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat down there.
As I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped he would leave before anything came up, but of course the fox went after a while.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost pissed himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, it was a mess.
That is Even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imager, which almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive things in a visible place in a sleeping bag by your feet and you should be fine.

The Interior obtained respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their procurement in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?

An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature-length documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a person who has lasted more than half a century at the forefront of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable hard work, it was and is a great honor for me. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karl Gott, who has brought joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer, " director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, the first day of filming took place already on October 22 last year, and the last shots with Karl Gott were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and actually all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a parade of the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film Phenomén Gott with this current one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them in a different stage of Karl Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession that he gave us and which confirmed to all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans here and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that she played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's frank openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team in such a way that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about relatively intimate topics. With my husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, I actually they have become part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But since I had another beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since 2019 I was everywhere , my wish was for it to be released in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and everyone who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself about the film.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology that trained people could use, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerillas are going to lead and it's a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in a conflict of such scale and intensity that guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for that.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kiko, the authority has allowed. But there is a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition has allowed the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other - under the condition of fulfilling the structural obligations established in favor of maintaining effective competition," said ÚOHS spokesman Martin Švanda.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it were to absorb the Kika chain as well, it would occupy too large a share of the Czech market for furniture and accessories. That's why he has to sell off part of the company he's buying.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be approved by the antimonopoly authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kiku last year for a nominal price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. She faced problems when she revealed irregularities in her accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside the companies IKEA, Sconto, Jysk and Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it belongs to the largest furniture sellers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
Only children. We are not sure of reproduction, but we don't have to worry
Some words have bad connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. The word only child belongs to them. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it does not sound neutral. "You know that, an only child," he says without needing to add anything. It is interesting that "only child" carries this feature since long ago, even from the times when expressions like demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. France and Sweden are the closest to it, but the simple rate of population reproduction is not ensured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel stands out, with a total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation made for alarmism. That is why it is not surprising that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Maláčová also falls for him: "There are almost as many single children as families with two children," she said in an interview for LN. But she forgot the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good when the problem is pointed out instead of trivialized or ideologized. Like in Germany, for example, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fad (in the style of "even Hitler supported it"). It is good to be reminded that many couples directly plan for an only child. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all that, let's point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only children" there is a sprinkle of demagoguery in it. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us remind you that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husákovy děti"). Then it dropped to an alarming 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is still not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they take a little away.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. They will buy 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion CZK) 6,000 former social apartments that the city sold 15 years ago. In this way, he responds to the pressure of the public, who are rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue the construction of new apartments and we will legally treat the freezing of rents," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing units overpaid by about ten percent over their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP said it on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money".
As early as mid-July, Gewobag got back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not disclose the price at the time. The dispute over apartments on the former GDR-era exhibition street was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, the newspaper wrote.
At the same time, the German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. According to AFP, rent prices have doubled over the past ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
mainly we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act like they have it.
Then such a situation arises that you watch as a guy who didn't hit an empty net 2 minutes ago drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they vote for him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "trick the defender" skill is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent's players.
Wife swapping: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve wracking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with his snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel as a punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! In addition, off-camera, he allegedly had to suffer like this on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and said to me - Aunt, I'm only making these troubles and notes so that I won't be here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the studio door. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed in the Educational Care Center in České Budějovice for a month. He briefly returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then went to a diagnostic institute for problem children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we had received the money. I almost didn't respond to that. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in the institution, that after that they they returned him, now he is in a diagnostic clinic. They are both unemployed," says mother Lucie from Plzeňsk.
Blesk, of course, also addressed the other party, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call me later," Aneta excused herself and hung up the phone.

The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was pulled up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and media company CME did not do well. It follows from the results of trading on the exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and ended with a small profit. "Nevertheless, it (the PX index) lost a little over one percent for the whole week," pointed out Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to 803 crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to 72.80 crowns. The shares of Avast gained 0.89 percent to 113 crowns, and operator O2 added 0.46 percent to 216.50 CZK.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to 294 crowns. The tobacco company Philip Morris then acquired less than a percent, whose shares rose to 13,640 crowns.
Securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
There were three losses - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. The euro lost four pennies to 25.85 CZK/EUR, the dollar lost three pennies to 23.62 CZK/USD. This follows from data on the Patria Online server.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as we know: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks grew".
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you no.
In the West they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and being lynched by the media.
Then it looks good in the surveys, the west is good, the east is bad.
But they find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20% according to the survey.
The French Oscar nominee Les Miserables will open the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and both winners of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the director's award and the jury award from Cannes and much more will present the 6th year of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year too, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and thought-provoking that the competitions of the three most important European film festivals have presented.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Miserables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes festival. The film is a French Oscar candidate. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally presented by the representatives of the two main roles of police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti also co-wrote the film.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art cinema), Ostrava (Mini cinema) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from October 2 to 8.
Ladj Ly's feature-length directorial debut was shown and awarded at a number of other world festivals after its success in Cannes. It won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award at the Durban IFF, and was also screened at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and San Sebastián IFFs.
As part of the festival, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyma, Young Ahmed, Disruptor of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We Didn't Catch You, Ghost Town Anthology and The Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will be heading to Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, and the Czech triumph The Painted Bird.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of warhead deployment due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only warheads were kept, not entire rockets, as they say.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit would come and pick up this warhead and mount it on some sort of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
At the memorial to the victims of terror, Babiš called for security cooperation
On September 27, 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very touching place," said the Prime Minister when, accompanied by his wife Monika, he laid a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousk and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 killed in the attack by hijacked planes on the former twin towers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, in their place there is now a memorial with a list of names of the victims.
"We need to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The Prime Minister identified the attack on the USA on September 11, 2001 as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. At that time, in addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the Ministry of Defense building in Washington, and they also planned another attack on a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this plane crashed when the passengers resisted the hijackers.
"That is our main enemy, that is where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," added the Czech Prime Minister.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he was cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to push me on the price, communication was smooth.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already transferred it to himself..
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out, vacates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color he is, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemia's paramedics, told Práv.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for reasons not yet determined, drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian Police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After he was rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector adds.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and provide data to the post office for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not take care of the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click a checkbox or two, put in two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls to supply the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed, and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Strict but fair, we have fun for hours! This is how Benešov high school students see their favorite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. A high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, novelist and revivalist of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind over the lyrics of Pavel Hoza. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, white country houses, trembling grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have followed them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynk teaches Czech, literature and history at the gymnasium in Beneš, runs a similar to Prague's Viola in the Café na slovíčko there, and organizes the Beneš literary festival every year.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get for example added (who is an employee)?
They gave me 2% gross this year, which is ridiculous, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.

The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament confirmed a rumor that has been known for several days: Canada is withdrawing the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the fight for human rights, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her role in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to grant Suu Kyi honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously supported it. "It is the right message both for her and for Myanmar and for the whole world," commented independent senator Ratna Omidvar on the decision of her colleagues. "We need to make it clear that the accomplices of genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as upstanding citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian parliament technically does not change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The long-time human rights campaigner's silence on the atrocities that the army of Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been perpetrating for endless months on the Muslim Rohingya minority is intolerable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens, was recently revealed by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigative team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "shock both by the horror of their actions and by their enormous scale". According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her administration were complicit mainly by covering up the actions of the soldiers and spreading a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".
After Suu Kyi's removal, five figures remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousafzai.
Developments around the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of the title of honorary citizen was added to Suu Kyi's profile. "We have also dimmed the lighting of her photo on the human rights timeline panel and are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesperson Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain with Suu Kyi in the current upheavals - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. "While Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are deplorable, her award will not be revoked," Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten told Canada's CBS.

The Supreme Prosecutor renewed the prosecution of the mother who manipulated the daughter against the father
Supreme Prosecutor Pavel Zeman does not agree with the acquittal of the mother, who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering education. The regional court acquitted her of the charges, Zeman disagrees. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a similar act can be seen as a criminal act.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a wider impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of streamlining further application practice," Zeman's appeal states.
The district court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty last year of abusing a trusted person and endangering the upbringing of a child. She formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she should have been entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to harm herself in the event of her father's custody.
The Svitava court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman of the charges in the appeal process, saying that it is not a criminal offense. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court ordered it to decide again.
The regional court noted that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are not at all exceptional. It is resolved in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the chief prosecutor, the woman committed both torture and endangering her upbringing. "The accused acted in a completely targeted manner when she aroused negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and purposefully confirmed these negative emotions. With such actions, she not only pursued the illicit intention of limiting or excluding the father's contact with the minor, but she must have been aware that this in the psychosocial will cause negative consequences in the sphere of minors," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court once more. It appears from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.

Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect his/her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The first Miss Christová finally came to her senses: She lost a few kilos and immediately looked through
The first modern Miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had problems with being overweight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but especially psychological ones. She suffered from the fact that she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took those criticisms to heart and went into battle with the extra pounds. Even if it's a long shot.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered even Paris. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to obey the strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started indulging in whatever she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. In addition, she tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothing, which added dimension to her curvaceous shapes.
Now it seems that Ivana has really gone into herself. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and according to her fuller figure.
At the launch of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75), she surprised everyone present that she looked through again and already has back the features of the charming brunette who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also because of the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first winner of the beauty pageant, but also the very first one to whom the audience in the Palace of Culture and Sports in Ostrava whistled as if they were deprived of their senses when she put on the crown.
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed by a year
The Administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has moved the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date for opening the envelopes was September 20, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submission of bids is the reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," said Drahný .
Compared to the original plans, the start of the renovation of the museum has been delayed by about a year. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park, the European subsidy of 123 million crowns for the project is not at risk.
The KRNAP administration is unable to select a construction company to repair the museum. It launched the second competition this summer, because in the previous tender all the offers of the companies significantly exceeded the expected price of 65 million at the time. The offers exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is located in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor center should be created in the now cleared building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibits.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and follow on from the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway for visitors to the Giant Mountains. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Krkonoše Mountains in the most understandable form and motivate people to explore the mountains and protect them. It should also take over the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theater performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a cafe.
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went about it in a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted advice from the police officers on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore handled by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit will not be punished
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. But they are also investigated if new information comes to light years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí, who were already 12 years old at the time. "A case from 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. To begin with, it would require finding the file, it may no longer exist, talking to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovič.
Under the previous regime, the public did not get much information about violent crimes, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that they were laxly investigated. "It always depended on specific people," thinks the criminalist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, even though unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Tech companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama has been somewhat burned by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point of humanity's ideological development and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of government."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather witnessing how, from the USA to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, rather illiberal models are winning and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is rethinking many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be brought back into the public sphere, and Marx was right about a lot. Although at the same time he insists that his thought development is still in line with the position of the nineties and that the critics of The End of History and The Last Man have misunderstood it.
"What I was saying back then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what the good life is. It leaves it they see no point in individuals who feel alienated, and therefore group themselves into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging."
In its time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we're talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear public services are in demand, that I don't think it's going to work. But if you mean redistributive programs that try to address the huge imbalances in income and wealth that we're already seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long the period ushered in by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of the unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm down the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Well, I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are approximately ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god at all than to risk choosing wrongly out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed sending me to hell or some such place?
Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to Vladimír Řepka's office spokesperson, the Ministry of Justice has so far received six requests in this connection and is now analyzing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the justice finally acquitted him.
Neither the Supreme Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec prosecutor's office charged a then 20-year-old student at the Nečesané grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman in the head several times with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by the doctors of the hospital in Hradec Králové.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent and I swear to that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," said the young man earlier in court, who did not deny that there was a fateful day in the hair salon. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him she was already closing. He then reported himself to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later identified Nečesané as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court successively handed down five judgments in the case. First, he found Nečesané guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Necesaný gradually went behind bars twice, but each time he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After the ordered replacement of the trial panel, repeated acquittals were eventually handed down, with the last one upheld by the Supreme Court in March of this year.
At the same time, the chairman of the appeals panel, Jiří Lněnička, stated in the justification of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but due to the procedural situation, he said he had no better option. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were valid.
"The problem with this case is not a lack of evidence, but its evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the preliminary proceedings, which would be more than sufficient for a guilty plea in another criminal case," stated Lněnička.
However, the Hradec High Court, as well as the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not be changed by the further annulment of the acquittal.

I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly floundering, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Well please, man.
All it takes is one election in the USA to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that they only need to show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military equipment of its time.

Kovosvit sells the administrative building and other halls. He expects worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, the consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Among the main problems of last year, Kuchar ranks the lack of workers and shifts of subcontractors. This year, the demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decrease in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and plots of land that it either does not use or only uses minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where two of the five floors are used, and not completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit and make its operations more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of any momentary solution, whether it is for example cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
Kovosvit exports roughly half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year Kuchař ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "Another order of the same volume is under discussion, which we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," said Kuchař. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor to Airbus. She delivered another machine this May, and she should deliver another one at the end of the year or at the end of 2020.
The company's main investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting grinders for the foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and armorer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded by Tomáš Baťa in 1939. At one time, the company had up to three thousand employees.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's last album will be released posthumously
The album Thanks for the Dance will contain unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish each song. In the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials left by his father. He invited a whole range of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck at random.
"When we came up with the music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he's still with us," said Adam Cohen about the album. "What amazes me most about him are the reactions of those who have already heard him. One by one they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first song of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his signature honey voice. He sang about death, he suspected that he would not live to release new material. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he declared.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen on December 31 by Argo publishing house.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is full of boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
By agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging cardboard has become more expensive by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, old electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, and reusable things can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the by the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Managers of state-owned companies have to go through a selection process. The law will be circumvented, the opposition claims
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said the chairman of the ODS parliamentary club Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes that are intended to prevent the non-transparent distribution of functions - critics speak of newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, applicants should go through a selection process at the given ministry and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection commissions are to blame for any bad selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the mentioned committee will not be binding for the minister. The news still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
I rather feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo applications, or actually mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron laid out the priorities for France's EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they could not be covered in six months.
However, French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of the straddle between the right and the left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is engaged in pro-European propaganda and is rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is currently touring France arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler in World War II, wasn't so bad, and he's having quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries tend to learn history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the top of the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy/fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone feels this way)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a living together.
Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the finals, the second title still eludes her
The plush environment in Tashkent proved it, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit here and this year she performed very confidently.
After wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmova, she fought her way into the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvancková did not go well for Kristýn. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková soon took a 3-0 lead, and Kristýna was unable to turn it around, even though she managed to convert one break point in the end. In the last one, she averted one match point, but the end came in the second one.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Housky: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
The undated picture shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The purpose of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies could engage.
If almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have put the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not have been one of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming superiority in them over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the biggest losses - due to blisters.
Zeman as a conservationist - A man straining the constitution calls for the enforcement of the law
Anyone who moves in a society divided into camps and doesn't want to go completely crazy will welcome a situation where they don't have to support only their own. When can he admit positives even to those whom he otherwise criticizes. If only so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to the pre-allocated stickers. Such situations also include the list of severely damaged monuments, which President Zeman fences with during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it's about. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of the devastated monuments - from the centers of historic cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and estates - with their own eyes. Everyone knows that even here the word demagoguery can come into play. That if we criticize the city hall for not taking care of monuments or some horror in the spatial plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized object whose owner cannot be traced. The head of state calls for local politics: "A paragraph of the monument law allows you to fine owners of buildings who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is elusive, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands for a good cause, similar to squatters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the swearing, squatters are drawing attention to a problem outside of current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president does de facto the same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the minting of tolars (dollars for Americans). Why? Supposedly because of the boom in home sales in the 1990s, officials there say. But why is it that seven kilometers away, Ostrov, the seat of the Šlik family, who minted the Jáchymovsk tolars, has its historical core nicely repaired? It is good if the president draws attention to these things.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets already in the fall.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections per day, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier here will replace České dráhy after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will make a total of 16 daily connections on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the running times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned shutdown works.
The operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should also continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in Českolipsk, for example, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they were dying.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, murdered them, while they were killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't come across anyone intentionally withholding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and there were a lot of things they were against too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there are also in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact are labeled as feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have also not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If something connects me with people, it's interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
The police charged the manager of CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, due to contracts for promotion
The police charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, due to contracts for promotion. Pangrác confirmed to the SeznamZprávy server that he accepted the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that the police officers were examining contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money was going back to Pangrác, the server writes. In the case, criminal investigators were also interested in Regional Development Minister Klára Dostálova (for ANO), to whose department CzechTourism falls. According to the server, the investigation into the case continues.
Detectives from the National Central Office against Organized Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. They also took the official computer from the minister's apartment. In the court order to search Dostálova's home, which was previously quoted by ČT, it was stated that in 2016, when she was deputy, the minister made decisions about the expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside of the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostálová declared that she felt absolutely innocent, that she had no doubts, that she could document everything and that she fully cooperated with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media previously reported that it was Aleš Pangrác, the former director of the regional partnership department at CzechTourism, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This resulted in the CzechTourism agency concluding 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment more on that," Pangrác told Seznam Zpravy severu.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing the second generation Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was practically no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. So not completely standard, the customer really had to go specifically for this car, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years they will be equal in price to hybrids. Of course, this is connected with the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often associated with the needs of ecological operation, not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to cover long distances for a single refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer that. Toyota could thus find new markets thanks to its extensive experience and long development.
It remains to be remembered that, just like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.
There are up to sixty times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of all life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic was released just this week, and according to it, the situation is even more serious than humanity has realized.
The study is based on field research in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico, during which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, there are "ten to sixty times fewer insects" in the forest today. It is about the decline of the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that depends on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, also decreases.
The authors of the research relate their conclusions directly to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
A large article about the report was published in the Washington Post on Monday, which presents the new findings immediately in the headline as hyperalarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner, whom the paper cites as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "The decline here is also an order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "It just runs for a significantly longer time here than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to explain why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the primeval forest compared to the 1970s.
Nokia is suing the Brno company over the name Lokia. Moravians believe that people will not mistake us
Nokia filed objections to the application of the trademark Lokia to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to CCV, product confusion is unlikely.
The Brno company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns don't like that the Brno-based company's warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, the E15 newspaper wrote. Nokia therefore filed objections to the application of the Lokia trademark to the Industrial Property Office. CCV judges that confusion is not likely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that two dozen customers are already using the program, it has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand is recognized and trusted around the world. When someone attempts to register a mark that we believe may lead to confusion or dilution of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said.
The developers from Brno claim that they did not think of the brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. According to the CCV, Loki's designation is based on the Latin name for a type of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to the movement of storekeepers around a warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really moving into the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be losing steam in its field," he responded in E15 CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák.
CCV filed for trademark protection with the Industrial Property Office in August before the program was launched. "She applied for protection for products and services belonging to class 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to class 9, the related services of business management in the warehouse belong to class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that Nokia's earlier trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services, and thus of course also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not challenge the claim the objector, if it is a matter of agreement on these classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to E15, a trademark dispute can last months and complicate the company's operations.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is an awfully nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always talks some shit about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholicism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael's Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans, and they even have mass there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him either this time, they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in every year with the troop, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing has changed regarding the delivery of flambé in the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light first by train to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, December 18 by scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep the distance, there should be as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, the light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, male and female scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money properly, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices in the corridors "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the inhibition of development when this company hangs on and takes orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Purposeful defamation? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city management attributes this to the rumors that have spread around the former zoo director and veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposely killed the exotic animals he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros Zamba, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan Nyunáka.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the municipal Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Doctor Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it a blatant dishonor of such a quality expert," she noted.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It is definitely not pleasant. The zoo currently provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "However, the garden must comply with the law on public contracts in terms of financing," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is among the recognized experts. For example, he took part in a unique operation in which Jane, the cheetah from the mouth of the mouth, was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous slander about him. He did not answer phone calls or respond to SMS text messages yesterday.
As for the order for the zoo, some vets believe that zero interest in it is not necessarily a concern about similar purposeful charges, as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not yet heard of her. "This is the first time I've heard from you. No one has approached us. I think this kind of thing will spread quickly," he added.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia Bíla!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová published her latest photos, in which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would judge me for taking pictures of myself naked at my age. I'm quite a shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want, you can do it even at 46 years to have a solid figure. Of course, there is hard work and sacrifice behind it, but there is no other way."
"We took about three thousand photos with Lukáš Dvořák, we chose about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came to her baptism, confided to Blesk very exposed.
She was wearing an elongated Bernhardt jacket and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten her bottoms. Running every day has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucia Bíla.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads don't move me, but then I catch myself that they have influenced me too - it's just so overwhelming that you can't always resist it.
It is also for this reason that I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban those internets.
There was a fire in the underground ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in the casing at a depth of about 1,200 meters. "Nothing happened to any of the employees, no one was injured. Bán rescuers immediately intervened on the scene, extinguished the fire with direct intervention and also carried out an inspection of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," said the spokesperson. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karvina district, coal is now mined only in the Karvina part, namely in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South mines. Mining at Dole Lazy should end this year, and the other mines are also expected to gradually slow down. Mining company OKD is the only producer of black coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons. 9,000 people work in the mines.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'll claim is critical thought"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says after all"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the Christmas movie trend and will present a record-breaking more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with audiences in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being produced.
Four times more Christmas movies were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came with a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competing channel Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't really matter, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the Christmas movie book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies ( I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to at least feel a bit of peace for two hours in the midst of all the holiday craziness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV always uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding, which is resolved successfully and the two kiss.
That's the way it goes, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people keep watching one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive test for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will take to the track from the last row, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety as the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You can be locked up for this too.
And everyone will be robbed, the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 Spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activity or confiscation of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
c) if, by doing so, he violates an important obligation resulting from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious injury to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years if he causes serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
A pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics for his optimistic view, such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that, according to a recent study, our country is the twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 evaluated countries.
Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot in a TV interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, however, gave other, not so "rosy" figures. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction procedures. It may happen that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant architectural heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also a slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, but people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stands, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed rail or metro to the airport for years. And Prague doesn't even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason is not only the absurd scramble for architectural competitions, spatial plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more daring could be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other rather foolish associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the diggers.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone highway network, nor to start building high-speed train lines, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by a "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes lost in the slenderian. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a solved puzzle.
Babiš entered politics with the promise that he would "fix things". In terms of meaningful investments and acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened yet. Although an amendment to the Act on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure has been in effect since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects, for example easier expropriation of land. And the new construction law, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of the construction procedure from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we're lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people probably wouldn't bet on it .

Declaration of the end of the right in the lower house, or what kind of "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Recently, there have been reports in the media and commentaries about the upcoming coalition of the mentioned parties. Many are applauding that the "right" is finally getting together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the given subjects label themselves or what label the mainstream media parrots. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in terms of its concept, ideology and voter targeting (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as centrist for a long time - however, their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel that I have taken everyone out of the same water? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal interference by the state in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfill this general right-wing assumption? How many laws cutting people's liberties with the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing attachment to the socialist EU or promoting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their labels, but their actions identify them. These parties, despite all kinds of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be at all surprised by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and, with the exception of Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see any obvious difference in them for the voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "the only right-wing party" and by associating with these three entities, it already openly reveals its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I mentioned the stickers briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties cheaply label critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't they or just don't want to understand that there are many people who do not smell Eurosocialism and growing unfreedom as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they hiding their complete incompetence in argumentation and their unreasonable or blind adoration of European Union conditions?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic other than centrist politics no longer have a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want this kind of merger. Maybe they want center-left politics under the guise of "right-wing" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can't even identify them). I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the WC
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Water Slalom Championship in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualification, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The next three Czech representatives will be aiming for a semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon corrective qualifying run.
From the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek did not succeed, as he received a fifty-second penalty at the very beginning of the race for incorrectly passing the gate. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can now rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-finals.
"I set myself the goal of making it into the top 30 on the first run, which I did. Not that I care how I did, because it's a very early start on Sunday, so I was hoping to be a little bit higher to have a better starting position," Přindiš said, praising the well-being in Seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. But then during the race it was good and today it's better again. It's beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so that's good," he smiled.
Prskavec was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn't do well in the first stages. Then I drove the middle perfectly, without any problems and I knew I had enough time, then the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the wheel. Overall, I can't be unhappy. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives boasted that they will only start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not an early bird, it's also cold here in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you need a jacket and a sweatshirt," Prindis said. "All in all, the semi-finals last an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," agreed Prskavec.
Of the trio of Czech singkanoists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advanced twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. the track I wanted to ride. I made two moves and I'm just behind the winner in pure time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," praised Fišerová.
The hunter was injured when he fell from his perch, and was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident happened before 8:30 in the evening in the top parts near Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then sent an ambulance to the accident," described the circumstances of the intervention, Libor Kluz, Horská dispatcher Beskydy services.
The rescuers found the hunter in the chosen location with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian cart over impassable terrain.
"The transport along the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured Nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaskovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and at the same time the rescuer who intervened, fortunately a fellow hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured man was.
"That's why we found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka application on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been there earlier, and at the same time, the dispatcher of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka application activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Step down, Czernin called on Schiller for her words about opposition dirt
"I consider it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government anywhere, much less on the floor of the parliament, to use such a totalitarian statement," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the draft constitutional lawsuit brought by the Senate was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I've been getting dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single voice in support of this lawsuit. There's messages in support of the president and messages like how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straw is being thrashed. And even if I dare, I'm not using harsh expressions, to quote one of them: It's opposition and senatorial dirt," said the finance minister.
"These expressions were used by the Nazis to refer to citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists to their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without an iota of respect for people and opinions," wrote the minister, the vice-chairman of TOP 09 Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman in the fall with the former first vice-chairman, Markéta Pekarová Adamova.
"I was quoting one of the many reports that I received dozens of during the session of the Chamber of Deputies. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dishonor that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive of Thursday's session of the Chamber. The fact that someone applies to itself, it surprises me," Schillerová responded to ČTK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. This is in response to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and for the bank to then pay the oil company's suppliers in cryptocurrencies. Staff are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign reserves, which are now near a 30-year low. This was reported by Bloomberg, citing information from four sources.
Sanctions imposed by the United States against the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This further deepened the country's economic crisis. However, the current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro's bid to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither Venezuela's central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value of these currencies it owns. The business is struggling to get payments from customers through conventional channels because big banks are unwilling to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the firm received most of the $700 million (CZK 16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan as the parties failed to find financial institutions to facilitate the transaction.
PDVSA may be reluctant to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as that would require it to register on an exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank to pay entities that PDVSA owes. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of the money laundering and customer information issues associated with them, complicating compliance.
After the debacle of 2018, cryptocurrencies are seeing a return to prominence this year thanks to expectations of greater institutional adoption and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin is down nearly 20 percent over the past four days, but has gained about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Tough competition for the Škoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. He leaves this item to the larger Sportage sibling, which is a direct answer to cars such as Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear part, can remotely resemble the world of SUV-coupes, popular in this part of the market, especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be placed just alongside plasticized versions of classic compacts, which include, for example, the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so those who don't want to, may not even have to see the Ceed in new forms.
Unlike the compact hatchback or estate Ceed, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic naturally aspirated four-cylinder. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged 16-liter with 150 kW, the GT version reserved for its siblings. Don't expect a sporty grade here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesel is only offered in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
The offer will soon be expanded to include a plug-in hybrid, i.e. a variant that can travel approximately six dozen kilometers on electricity alone. The batteries can also be charged from a normal socket.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarovski company.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there is one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If MZ is detached from reality, it doesn't matter much - he will have the faulty circuit blown out and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that the departure of FB from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under the influence is really unlucky).
I think it would clean up the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of "Soviet brotherly aid" to some of our political parties and representatives would be better clarified.
Then the people who vote for them would also have a clearer picture of whose interests they really care about.
Too bad they don't own TikTok too.
A lot of teenagers would suddenly discover with great surprise that the Sun is shining outside...
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed the two-match ban
Football Sparta has appealed against the two-match ban for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for being sent off in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letenský club informed about it on its twitter and is now waiting for the appeal commission's verdict.
Tetteh already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now trying to ensure that the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker can play in Sunday's 11th round first league match in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary committee for being sent off against Liberec.
The appeals committee did not have time to discuss the case, so it delayed the effectiveness of the punishment and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match suspension for the midfielder from Olomouc the following week, and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian suspended Tetteh for a foul on Slavist David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the opponent's captain Tomáš Souček was not proven.

Spilková in a pair. In Indianapolis, he is on the verge of promotion after the first round
After the first round of the Tech Championship tournament in Indianapolis, golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys and finished the opening day at even par at the LPGA Series event. With a score of 72, he is tied for 69th place, which is the expected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took a rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after a temporary illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she is not doing very well. Out of twelve tournaments, she passed the cut three times, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. He is thus fighting to keep his card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and is two shots ahead of her three opponents.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She looked younger in her fair hair
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even though she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she never looked like a retiree. And now she helped it even more. She changed her image until her colleagues did not recognize her.
The actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had gray hair, wore regular things and went out sporadically in society. She has always taken care of herself and the older she gets, the more she can loosen up in terms of her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of good old Indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she changed the color of her hair and looked completely new.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow coat that made her shine even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even at the threshold of seventy they can take risks with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks at most fifty.

About the situation in the US with a leading African-American reporter.
In the United States, new cases of police violence are coming to light, this time during the crackdown on nationwide protests.
The demonstrations that broke out after the African-American George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest have opened up a debate about systematic racism, the work of the police and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to one of the leading African-American journalists, The Atlantic reporter Adam Serwer.
But how would that funding increase?
The Union pours money into us in subsidies.
If he stops doing that, we stop having the money.
I really don't see how the union stopping giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that is a completely different discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cool type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, then you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, the first thing to do is sort it by undertone. Pay attention to the texture in the next one.
If you belong to women with a cold undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the warm skin undertone category, choose such lipsticks as well. You can recognize them by the fact that they gravitate towards orange, coral, gold or brown highlights.
You may find that some veins appear green and others appear blue. In that case, congratulations - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.

The end of political newspapers? According to critics, the new law will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to allow ministers to get rid of responsibility for the election and at the same time continue to choose their own candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the goals of the Nomination Act. 119 MPs spoke in favor. The law was passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out in the end.
Civic democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will impose restrictions on ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will therefore not have a clear transparent responsibility," thinks SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. The vice-chairman of the ODS, Martin Kupka, speaks similarly.
The Government Committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free status, a minimum age of 25, and the main selection criteria should also be expertise.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and then be signed by the president.
The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the help of NATO countries, in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
The head of the police union, Štěpánek, has resigned, he wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Trade Union of the Police, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. It was reported on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be the president of the union for another two months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I submitted my written resignation to the board, after which I will continue to perform my duties fully for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I decided as a free person who doesn't want to be tied to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a more peaceful life," he stated the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of security forces and employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. For example, in 2011 he also got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior, Radek John, and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Sydney to London in four hours? A possible reality in 2030
The Saber combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed at which the Concordes flew. "Once the Saber engine is up and running, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could be covered by an airplane in one hour.
Server Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which five times the speed of sound are exceeded, are complicated by engine overheating. But the Saber (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super cold helium, which should prevent the temperature from rising.
"The most important thing about the Saber is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine, which is powered by a stream of exhaust gases created from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't evolved that much in the last 70 years, while airplanes have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and you basically create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just take a few infusions, Zeman joked
On Tuesday, the head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN). According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "disease conditions" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors discovered mild signs of dehydration at the president's examination. His problems with low pressure were caused precisely by insufficient watering. "In order to further dehydrate my body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the President mentioned that Zavoral had received several hateful messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So a quick recap: heart beats like a bell, lungs are clear as if he's not a smoker, liver works as if I'm abstinent, kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on," said Zeman.
The editors of iDNES.cz turned to the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The question of Zeman's health became a topic especially at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president walks poorly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and is hard of hearing. For the sake of his health, he has cut down on smoking.
Going on holiday with only a credit card? NEO account offers free ATM withdrawals worldwide!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have gotten used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include mainly convenience, security, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but nowadays payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to repeatedly go to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" do not want to rely on the fact that they will have enough cash. Moreover, some foreign currencies are not even available in Czech banks or exchange offices. With the NEO account, we have therefore solved it so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs for free, no matter where they are," says Kateřina Petko, director of marketing and communications and spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way of not losing your money than cash. If a full wallet is lost, its owner does not have to wait any longer for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately by phone or via internet banking. If you act quickly, you don't have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages in addition to its reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It can be set up and managed completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100,000 euros, and account management is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, just owning a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, with the embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are traveling. This often eliminates any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the given insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities that travelers plan to undertake.
The women's basketball players did not reach the medal from the under-17 World Cup, they finished fourth
The third U17 World Cup was also won by the American women, who beat Spain in the finals narrowly 77:75 despite the 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadoresová.
"We really wanted to win and not be potatoes, but maybe we wanted it too much. We grabbed the start, but we couldn't keep it because they rolled over us under the basket," lamented captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two three-pointers and dominating the court throughout the first quarter. At that moment, it seemed that they would avenge the defeat from the basic group 85:88 after overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at halftime and helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12-2 lead with questionable decisions.
"I'm convinced that it was enough to make two or three more baskets, run to 20 points and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch up," coach Richard Fousek assessed.
"It wasn't the first time that we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything go and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs especially kept Petra Holešínská in the game with accurate shooting from a distance and the pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they kept even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five matches were very demanding, we rotated the matches in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of energy. You could already see against Spain that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take them. Due to our physicality, we were not consistent in defense. We did not play a quick counterattack , we lacked a rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win," added Fousek.
He believes that his ward has a promising future. "In two years, the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, be second in the 16-year-old European Championship, and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with good character, and we need to work with it further and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation, which a coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamovo.
"Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamovo, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov is not proven," said Ciupek.
In the week, six cases appeared in the region.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of those mentioned have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone who resides abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being checked.
There were also players from South Africa on it, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales
He wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortion.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some guns in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against fetal heartbeat detection.
People would then be entitled to damages by suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Texas abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to remain in place and greatly supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for "ghost guns" or kits for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge struck down the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict, warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban full immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue select officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already being widely published in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should soon be on the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective.
Feel free to leave the amount of the curriculum.
But rethink WHAT is being taught.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a little, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
In these things, it would be possible to cut down really brutally.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things that he will necessarily need for life?
How can I legally watch Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have a Netbox at home and I pay for a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League but I don't want to switch TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobr's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to subvert the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the most powerful and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he declared.
Someone killed a non-conflicting homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime in the early evening or overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who was driving over the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the Pod Krejcárkem street could have filmed the killer, for example, on the onboard camera. A witness might have just seen him and could describe him. In short, we welcome any testimony in this case and will accept him on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the regional police headquarters.
According to spokesman Daňko, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflictual, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the crime scene. "She was most often around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags," added Daněk to the description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Mahulena Bočanová interrupted her annual detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided in Blesk that she had been drinking alcohol. "During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my old worn-out 50-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel very rested, I have a lot of energy, and most of all, my psyche has improved. I haven't been feeling well mentally lately. I feel better I wake up, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, money."
A year of abstinence was said to be enough and the actress found her way to alcohol again. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to anymore. I have one glass and have fun until the morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for about a week. I also got a taste for non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," she boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová has also returned to the theater season after the holidays and will be appearing in the series Ordinace v rozá žádraten. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I argued. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
But to know it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for the other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, uncommon and specialty cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If I can avoid it, I don't even bother going to any market anymore, a sale, a sale, a gold shop on the square, maybe they don't have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it's in some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.

And I don't really care anymore.
For two years I have watched the data being treated like manure here, most of the anti-vaccines are just a little more out of line than most of the pro-vaccinators.
Although rational discussion takes place at the professional level, only extreme opinions reach the public space.
Wall to wall all the time.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This is how this country is and we are like this.
But the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two countries is not addressed by anyone.
Phew, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring and I wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a wooden spoon in my childhood.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "tap" she would only bring a wooden spoon and put it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a couple of kicks on the ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice, in a way, to disobey and get it, or to improve and not be punished.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
The former French president Chirac will be buried on Monday, the public piet will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French president Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This is reported by the French media with reference to Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon during a piet at the Paris Invalides, where the casket with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been pouring into the presidential palace since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign the condolence book. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared national mourning.
In the meantime, other reactions are coming from the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom today Prime Minister Édouard Philippe described as "French in the true sense of the word".
For example, Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, as the politician was known for his love for their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The tribal art museum on Paris's Quai Branly, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document to which he swears and which he learns in school from an early age, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary , he was definitely leaning towards the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is emerging more and more often among lawyers.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies face throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the game rules for politicians.
We fear that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder on children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novinkám.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the children's infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus have only recently been in the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age," said the primary.
He is happy, however, that no children have died from the coronavirus at the Children's Hospital of the National University Hospital in Brno.
According to the available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in a children's hospital – not just in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the application of the vaccination dose for children as well," added the doctor.
Line D will be overseen by a new metro architect, she brings experience from the London underground
The Prague transport company has chosen an architect who will oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become her, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport structure, traveling underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender issued by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other bidders participated in the tender. "Part of the selection process was a motivational letter and a CV. Apparently my previous experience in London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three, made the decision," explains the new metro architect. In the same way, according to her, her experience from the Institute of Planning and Development in Hl. city of Prague.
He does not see the metro only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have an aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved. But I will find out how it will actually work in the coming weeks, when the transport company will introduce me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"It is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the main goal of which is to maintain the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "I don't really know yet whether the manual is ideal, or whether some personality can cover it," Švarc concludes.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside of marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course outside of national parks it is not so closely monitored).

The lessor is not obliged to provide...
The Lessee undertakes to pay the Lessor advance payments for the services listed above, at monthly intervals, in the amount specified in Appendix No. 3 when the Lessor signs this contract.
The lessee agrees with the deposit set in this way.
The service deposit is payable together with the rent.
The Lessor is entitled to unilaterally set a new amount of advance payments for services to the Tenant, taking into account the services taken by him in the past period so that the amount of advances corresponds to the approximate monthly consumption of services by the Tenant according to the past period; similarly, it can do so in the event of a change in price regulations or circumstances decisive for determining the amount of payments for the use of the apartment or the price of the services purchased.
The change in the amount of advance payments is effective from the 1st day of the month following the month in which the notification of the increase in advance payments was delivered to the Lessee.
The Tenant agrees to such a method of setting down payments.
The Lessor undertakes to make a statement of the advance payments for services paid by the Lessee and the services actually taken within 3 (three) months of receiving the final invoice from the suppliers of individual services at the latest.
Any overpayment or underpayment of payment for services is due on the 15th day after delivery of the bill to the Tenant, unless the Tenant objects to the bill.
The agreement of the billing parties is valid only if they are not modified by a legal regulation.
Article VIII. Duration and termination of the contract
The contract is concluded for a fixed period, until...
The rental relationship established by this contract will end at the end of the period for which it was agreed.
The tenancy can be terminated at any time if the parties agree.
Another way to terminate the contract is by termination.
Both the Lessee and the Lessor are entitled to terminate this agreement in the situations, in the manner and for the reasons established by law.
Termination of the lease requires a written form and must reach the other party.
Both the Lessor and the Tenant shall state the reason for the termination and whether it is a termination without a notice period; In addition, the Landlord will inform the Tenant of his right to object to the termination and propose a judicial review of the legality of the termination.
The notice period begins on the first day of the month following the month in which the notice was delivered to the other party, unless it was a notice without a notice period.
The lessee grossly violates his obligation arising from the lease, if
a. sublet the apartment or part of it or for free use to a third party without receiving the prior written consent of the Landlord,
b. makes construction modifications or other significant changes without the consent of the Landlord,
c. fails to notify the Lessor of the need for repairs beyond the scope of normal maintenance and does not allow him to carry out these repairs, as a result of which damage to the property of the Lessor or third parties in the amount of ten times the monthly rent occurs,
d. if he accepts another member of his household and thereby exceeds the limit established in Article VI.
last sentence
e. Animals or other organisms kept by the Tenant will repeatedly seriously disturb other residents of the house or the Tenant repeatedly does not remove possible pollution of the house caused by the animal kept by him, and does not arrange remedial action despite warnings,
f. repeatedly violates the usual rules for behavior in the house and the Landlord's reasonable instructions for maintaining proper order and does not remedy the situation despite a warning.
The Tenant violates his obligation arising from the lease in a particularly serious manner, in particular, if the debt for unpaid rent or advance payments for services, with the payment of which the Tenant is in arrears, exceeds the amount corresponding to three times the rent, or the arrears for the bill are not fully paid within three months from the due date paid off.
Article IX. Returning the apartment
The tenant is obliged to clear out the apartment at his own expense no later than on the day of termination of the rental relationship, remove all equipment and accessories that he has installed in the rented premises, and hand over the apartment to the Lessor in the condition in which he took it over from him, taking into account normal wear and tear.
If there is damage or excessive wear and tear to the apartment or its equipment, the Tenant is responsible for the damage caused by him or caused by persons to whom access to the apartment or the apartment was granted due to unconscious negligence.
In the event of the Tenant's delay in vacating or handing over the apartment, the Lessor has the right to vacate the apartment at the Tenant's expense at any time, to which the Tenant expressly agrees.
The contracting parties have agreed that if the Tenant does not pick up the things he left in the apartment even within 30 (thirty) days from the end of the lease, the Lessor is entitled to dispose of these things in a suitable way and to use the proceeds to satisfy his claims against the Tenant.
Any cash surplus will be sent by the Landlord to the Tenant to the account provided by the Tenant.
Minor repairs and costs associated with routine maintenance of the apartment, the need for which arose before the end of the lease, will be provided by the Tenant no later than the date of handing over the apartment (end of lease).
If the Tenant fails to do so, the Landlord will ensure the necessary repairs and routine maintenance at the Tenant's expense.
The Tenant agrees to this.

China is building the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for its failure to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, for example even in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
They freed hundreds of enslaved children from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, said that there were over three hundred children aged five and over. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna Police Chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on a tip-off. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire over the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo, they were local teachers.
The children told police that their parents or relatives had taken them to the school, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who are from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by their parents from the Nigerian states in the north," said spokesman Sabo on the identity of the victims. The Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal pretended to be a religious school focused on the study of the Qur'an.
The liberated were taken to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Banks provide children's accounts free of charge. However, the offer should be considered, because some other services for the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, the basic management of which is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses expect that the waived fees will be returned to them one day. Given the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts can do. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, monitor account movements, has his own electronic banking available somewhere. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to the parents to teach their children how to handle them and also to control their payments.
"Relatively flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and the like. But above all, he can monitor what is happening on the account, either by viewing it via the Internet or thanks to information SMS. Be careful, these may no longer be free." adds Kuncová and adds: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options."
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He mainly wishes for peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any questions. In his show, Call and write to the boss, he speaks publicly on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he brilliantly and humorously glosses over. Although this time he was not amused.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is the very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and he said it fairly, without tabloid journalists having to poke around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would of course wish him successful treatment and, above all, peace! The calm that he needs now," stated the owner of the television Barrandov.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't even like the various statements, what his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health. And for I can tell our media that we will focus on his illness and his person only if he himself shows interest in it. I think other media should consider a similar approach."
The couple wrapped the bitch in tape and drowned her in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a one- to two-year-old donated dog that she wanted to take care of. But her ten years older partner didn't like that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and largely eliminated its vocalization. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in the bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive." said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They therefore called out to a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency line 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the residents of the town, the police found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokeswoman added.
An expert statement from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in an unmistakable agonizing manner as a result of suffocation, where the animal suffered for several minutes before death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The Commissioner of the Criminal Police from Zlín accused the pair of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed as an accomplice. Both accused persons, who have not yet been punished, could sentenced to spend up to three years behind bars," noted Kozumplíková.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were traveling in the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "At 9:30 in the evening, the plane requested permission to land at Chaloupky airport near Klatov," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. That was also the last record, at that time according to the GPS coordinates it should have been near Vojovice near Žinkov.
However, it did not arrive at the Klatovsk airport. The search for the lost plane, which had sent an emergency signal, began immediately. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was also involved," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. But the search did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last reported, the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found the plane and two bodies without signs of life," confirmed Korandová.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches, pieces also fell on the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Aviation Accidents," added Korandová.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I don't take anything, he defends himself
The traditionally much-watched fight for the fastest man on the planet will be the hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the leader of the world charts with a time of 9.81 seconds and has only lost once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was in jeopardy due to the case of missed doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dated his first offense back to April 1, 2018, i.e. to the beginning of the second quarter, but he missed the test itself only on June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman was not guilty of three missed checks in 12 months.
Coleman argued that he simply forgot to update the data on the app about the athletes' whereabouts. "I don't take drugs, I don't take anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's it," he said before the start of the WC.
He suffered the only defeat out of six starts this year at the 100 at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where compatriot Noah Lyles surpassed him by just six thousandths of a second. He used Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Cup.
On paper, the second fastest competitor is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru with a performance of 9.86, but he has only been successful in American university competitions so far.
The 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June, will defend the title. However, he ran the last 100 in Zagreb in just 10.29, because he slightly injured his hamstring.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favorites. The fastest Jamaican is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100 will start on Friday with the preliminary round and heats. The semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medal race will take place at 21:15 CEST.
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with the trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want, I will sell you the elephant for 5,000.
Friend: yes, I'll slap myself, that will be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you talk badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The priority of the children's clinic is built by an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech, and today few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad study in the Czech Republic and could stay and work here. The pediatric clinic in Prague's Motol tried to get some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive around five o'clock in the afternoon at the Motol hospital in Prague, she had to get up a lot. The Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Sulaymaniyah, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoons treats small patients in a private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be successful.

I thought that too and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just playing with words :D
Either way, it's a ridiculous request

She has now been banned from keeping animals for life by Gwent Magistrates' Court, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her abuse say they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court she was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled and happy with a male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered the horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat over drug allegations.
Milly can be heard swearing profanity in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: "You want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell.
1,600 pounds worth of cocaine was found in her house (roughly 50,000 crowns), hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same things in freshman year as in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffoonery, when no one, with the exception of honor, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if you can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even bother to tell you that they're totally screwed.
So what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and don't need to.
And at that point it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need this thing.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this while standing by the machine, I was completely serious... ...because you simply don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to the time when not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and bullying against educated people and elites probably also play a part) However, the price of having barbarians stand by those machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these dimensions.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why he can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her about Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it was creaky from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, that is, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he fumed at Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Even his younger sister Linda didn't like Kadri's supposed honesty with his now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never said these things to each other very much.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't stand it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most despite his young age.
It saddens me even more when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, in the end he stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole matter is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.

More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Liberecko region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 candidates applied for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it, said Eva Krumpová, deputy chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komni in the Uhersko-Hradišť region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of the voters voting for them.
Jana Křižková, the previous mayor of the village, who is a member of the Private Party, also got into the council on their behalf again.
Independent candidates won one mandate in the local council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimovsk region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia na Mostecko were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The candidate Obec pro lid, which received the vote of 43.27 percent of the voters, finished second, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberecko were won by the independent candidates Naděj pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of the voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has new hope
Honzík's parents first noticed that something was wrong with him when he was a year and a half old. He always stared into space for several minutes, became motionless and did not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a children's neurology clinic, where the doctors, after a series of examinations, diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, but it did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the perfect combination of drugs that made him stop having seizures completely. At the age of five, the doctors stopped his medication, and since the seizures did not return, his parents assumed that Honza was healthy and began to encourage him to do more sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven he had another seizure and everything started anew.
The doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, the seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honzo always lost consciousness during a seizure, the parents were terrified that he would get it while playing sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding a bicycle and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although the sport gave him fits from time to time, he never completely gave it up. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in case of emergency.
When Honzo was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists at the General Hospital in Motola. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the tumor from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to undergo 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain that sensed its activity, then they were able to remove the bearing. It was a few weeks of hell for me. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires were sticking out of my head , which were connected to the computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful, and the doctors removed the rather extensive deposit. "The first days after the operation, it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Compared to how lively and communicative he is normally, it was a scary change, but luckily everything returned to normal after a few days," he describes mom and adds: "He had 1 seizure a month and a half after the surgery, but according to the doctors it happens. He has been seizure free for 3 months since then."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started working with Company E, with whom he goes to schools for talks about epilepsy. Honza is not fully involved in sports activities yet, he is slowly returning to sports. "I'm learning how to do sports correctly, how to breathe well, so as not to expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI paddling triathlon, in which patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, and which takes place this weekend, September 28, 2019, at Veselská pískovna. But maybe next year.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that you know very well everything that people here write to you.
You're just playing the fool so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old one
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, for example, but the state and the church have nothing to do together

French chef sues Michelin over star withdrawal I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after he won it. He intends to sue the publisher of the Red Guide to get the exact reasons for the downgrade. Veyrat also doubts the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, confused saffron with cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be sued because, according to him, the conclusion of the commissioners was not properly justified. In addition, according to him, the star was removed without any warning. "I've been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you mess with the chefs' health?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have given the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have been working with Savoy ingredients with love since the beginning," Veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are frauds who only cause disputes for commercial reasons." An outraged Veyrat doesn't understand "how they could say we put cheddar in our souffle". "They also insulted our region, my employees were mad about it. We have eggs from our own chickens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he got angry.
The distinctive chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and that is why he is asking for his restaurant to be removed from the Red Guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he does not yet have any meaningful charges and his lawyer is yet to help him formulate one. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
A man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
After arriving at the scene, the paramedics discovered that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger to his life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokesperson of the EMS of the Ministry of Health of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical personnel are primarily on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile virus infection from a mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit, for example, malaria.
Germany reported on Friday the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German soil after being bitten by an infected mosquito. This was reported by the DPA agency. Until now, all sick people contracted the virus during travel or contact with sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of infection is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute reported that a 70-year-old man from Saxony contracted the virus. His illness had a serious course and he was treated in a hospital in Leipzig for brain inflammation. He is now healthy.
West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and also mosquitoes, which become infected with their infected blood.
The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
After all, things happened at the UFC 269 tournament.
The outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who did not find a defeater for seven whole years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, putting on a great choke against Dustin Poirier to defend his belt.
Also picking up a win was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a first-round TKO.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf", because Nunesova had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, sending her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack using her arm lever.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated each other with a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock back the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the cards gradually started to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, and tried to hit the opponent with a lever on the arm.
He didn't do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed a sovereign triumph, having already used a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he charged him with a series of well-aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
His hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "hip" are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern of "machine", in the latter according to the pattern of "song".
Another group of nouns has different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "rádek/rádka", "kedluben/kodlubna" or "brambor/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "príkopa", " donut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but they gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained uninflected in the neuter, but in the masculine has endings following the pattern of "castle".
Civilization on borrowed time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "message" from one of Šimek's great stories with Grossmann, which takes place partly in a cemetery, which goes like this: "I warned her that she cries well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are behaving very similarly now.
They act as if humans rule planet earth. In reality, we are just a speck on her surface, which she can blow away with her immense powers like a strong gust of wind a candle flame. Probably few of them watch the famous British and American science documentaries discussing the destructive capabilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to really "crack up" and our advanced civilization would be ruined.
And it is highly likely to happen in the near future. According to leading volcanologists, a number of large volcanoes are "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if that eruption, if it had to happen, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are completely wasted on measures aimed at reducing the production of carbon dioxide, because any really angry volcano can release it, together with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the inhabitants of Europe.
It therefore makes no sense to forcefully limit CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
If we realize the still insufficiently researched influence of the solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we have to come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let's try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible and try to adapt to the other changes, which we cannot cope with forcefully, with the least possible cost!

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewable resources will not cover the increased demand, says the head of European ExxonMobil
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unfavorable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, claims this in an interview for HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, in which unused energy from days when the sun and wind are plentiful, could be stored for later, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company's operation.
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by those around them or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
However, too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "most of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sex offenders.
Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China is preparing celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army rehearsed the parade during recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing were forced to close and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square and warplanes circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud to see their country flaunt its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would make other states uneasy.
Apparently she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up. But they may also have concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against the Chinese-appointed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies opposite the island of Taiwan and is among the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. It already has drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, The Guardian pointed out. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo was deleting "harmful political information".
"It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) against all odds," said China historian Maura Cunningham. "It is a time when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 when the Communists under Mao Zedong won a battle against Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators from the ranks of students and workers with tanks in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly adopted elements of a capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (monopoly of one party and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
The Czechia is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to finish them
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of it.
She does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them have done it.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earning," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of construction graduates and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," explained Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance into the new year has also traditionally been accompanied by politicians' speeches.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
The ministry is planning a flat-rate meal plan from 2021. Nothing changes in terms of taxes
The MoF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, even a quarter of the employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive food stamps, will receive meal support.
According to the chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators David Rýc, however, even a number of small companies that do not have canteens or meal vouchers provide meals for their employees, for example by importing food or by making an agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the plan is that we are not changing anything about the tax benefit. Furthermore, health and social insurance will not be paid from it," Schillerová said on Friday. She added that the limit for the employer's maximum contribution applicable as a tax discount would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to reimburse a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal ticket. The remaining part is paid by the employee, in some cases the employer also pays it, but without a tax discount. The most favorable value of the meal voucher for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
As for that, the diploma seems great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
Stateswomen are completely at ease with us, if a person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him unnecessarily on theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state book and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately understood and I got it right.
Otherwise about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great if there is an exam at the end of the subject, in which the knowledge gained in the project is reflected, not just a defense.
Autotuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, reads the headline of a long piece written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative explanation, it is written that the medical community ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a merciless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people, which not only affected public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states at the outset is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing and knowing facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that they would prevent the disease. However, the British Navy abandoned this practice due to concerns about increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then proven in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years before the navy took it into account. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they only became mandatory in the 1960s, and the first confirmed asbestos-related death dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every discovery in public health—no matter how important—has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, almost 80 percent of the adult population and about one third of children meet the definition of overweight or obese. More Americans are living with obesity today than breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
At the same time, obesity is seen as a supremely personal failure of the individual, which is claimed to burden the healthcare system and reduce GDP. The fear of being fat is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, the truth is that diets don't work. Already in 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of dieters subsequently gain more weight than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Here, the personal meets the systemic, when, for example, at the faculties, when teaching future doctors, only 19 hours of the entire course are devoted to the issue of nutrition. Which at a time when 60 percent of the calories Americans consume comes from ultra-processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries where overweight people typically experience shorter visits, are treated with less empathy by doctors, and are seen as more problematic patients.
However, obesity is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes. Since 1980, the proportion of obesity has doubled in 73 countries of the world and increased in 113. And during that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Everything is ok, but don't flood the e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be a pee like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it in such a way that he can kick Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under artists' feet.
As soon as you don't post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, it keeps changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's been really bugging me lately, so maybe I'll have to downsize to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't let it go.
In the end, I would perhaps be happy if something more user-friendly came along, which does not drain all the creativity and energy from the artists
Declaration of the Workers' Party of Donbass
Union - yes, disintegration - no, opponents of the disintegration of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of the pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Białowieża Forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and separated from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident on D5: The highway was closed by a truck collision
The incident was reported around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through the gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Petr Svoboda, spokesman for the Central Bohemian Fire Department, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was transporting plastic granules. "Due to the large impact, there was a displacement of the transported vehicles, which the firefighters had to first secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 liters. Workers from the environment department of the Berun town hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The recovery of the crashed vehicles and the opening of the highway was ensured by a private company, which also excavated the contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I will buy it and put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
This crap about how if something is cheap it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
The Germans elected Keller as the head of the football association
As expected, Fritz Keller, the current head of Bundesliga Freiburg, became the new chairman of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for a three-year term, he had no opponents.
In the position, Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an affair with undeclared income. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery in the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals will be to restore confidence in the union and lead it out of crisis. "It's not going to be a one-man show, many people will take responsibility. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
After being elected head of the union, Keller left his position in Freiburg.
The Děčín Zoo is happy to have a small macaque
"Our troop currently has seven members. Her youngest member was born on August 17, the female Buffy gave birth to him and he is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. The first days after birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to her body and did not want to show it to the world for a long time , whether she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, the cub began to gradually put him down for a short while, and the keepers already know for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín Zoo had already successfully bred 12 young of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. A typical feature is the black coat and crest on the head, which gives them their name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, mainly at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The menu is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. They meet their protein needs by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"If we leave aside the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for their fur. Burning and cutting down the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," added the spokeswoman .

Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia lost control and drove off the road. The car flipped onto its roof and he was wedged underneath. He did not survive his injuries.
"According to the initial information found on the spot, a passenger vehicle traveling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned onto the roof and the driver was wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told novinky.cz.
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about god, I was confused, but I suspected it was going to be some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, he was a good old man, full of completely useless lessons, like how I should wash myself and not be a dick.
It's a shame about the paper, because of this the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out with a friend whom she did not like to hang out with.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and she started to be beaten on a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her, but that I could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to run amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positives who would not even know about the terrible disease if it were not for the test.
All we get is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being put under five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
In the West, they have stopped with this farce and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I'm looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is coming back to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you don't need to be interested, mainly get people".
I was honestly interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make people talk.
When the first money came in, one quickly realized that if one wanted to make money, one had to pitch a few certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump at every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Sándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated during the week that the army planned the last farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the family, to be bombastic, as only soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, denied this.
"It's nonsense! We've been in contact with the family from the beginning, the agreed-upon Friday funeral date has been valid since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like military honors are valid. We'll just deal with the possible participation of the media in consideration of the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday, and all military honors, including a flyover of fighter jets, will not be missing.
There is still a tense atmosphere surrounding the final farewell to the popular general. People who worked with the general in the past will not participate in the funeral ceremony due to the decision of the organizers!
This is, for example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Sándor remembers his former colleague as a hardworking, intelligent and "good guy".
In addition, he regularly met with him in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to Milan Jakubů's funeral," Šándor told Bleska. But he can't.
"I also know other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates are usurping the funeral for themselves. I think it is wrong to privatize the funeral like this," said the security expert. He doesn't even like the supposedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of the army's top brass.
"The leadership of the army is not secret, and neither are the leaders of the military intelligence, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family really let the army back it up, it is of course a matter for the family. I personally would never admit, for the army to overcome the family and its wishes," Sándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn on Saturday. The head-on collision between the Milan Rapid and the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the sports car driver Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer should have entered the opposite direction in the corner, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. The police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. ČOI revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation about prices and failure to comply with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refused to allow smaller children into the establishment. According to ČOI, it writes on its website that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "In response to the consumer's electronic inquiry as to whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one four-year-old child in the said restaurant, the employee of the restaurant replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to the table, while it allowed English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," the ČOI spokesperson described the situation.
Both cases are now being resolved in administrative proceedings. Since they have not yet been legally terminated, the inspector's spokesman could not provide more detailed information about the mentioned restaurants.
However, discrimination appeared only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, ČOI carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the mentioned two cases of discrimination, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. These were mostly deficiencies in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. Legal fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed in these cases.
I haven't experienced many such things in the company where I work.
HR is calm, the managers look after their own management and don't poke our noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it takes place it works quite well for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we are a near-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.

The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission, and after approval they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
Hašek wants the fans to be positive. Sparta is in for a hit in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. To win the match in terms of play and results," Spartan player Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club television.
In the week, he decided the cup duel in Jihlava with a goal (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was an obligation for them. She is relieved, but she continues to struggle with the game.
Even though the season is slowly flowing into the second third, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek talked about at the end of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, which has very high-quality players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncový sady for the last time, in mid-May, it was a definite matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a spiritless performance with a 0:4 beating, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While at that time the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the mutual match, Sparta is now losing nine points after ten matches of the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It is not an easy situation either for us or for the fans, who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hašek feels. “But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us.
Sparta does not know if they will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who was given a two-match suspension for the suspension in Pilsen, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only member of the squad who remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain among the many dead.
The home team, who have won the last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Čermák. And as captain, defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan native, should lead them into the match.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV. exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed by people in Prague's Klementin today and on Saturday. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Chapel of Mirrors. Entrance to the exhibition is free, it is open on both days from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
An exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV. prepared by the library together with the National Archives. On a written legacy from the reign of Wenceslas IV. the National Archives looks at it from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said about the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, i.e. a prayer book of one of the Benedictine nuns of the St. George Monastery at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he listed reasons why people should see the exhibition according to him.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts a half-figure of the English king Henry II. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, next to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV. he also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a collection of Latin treatises by John Wycliffe from around 1411 to 1414.
From the library of Wenceslas IV. not a single book has survived on Czech territory. According to experts, this library belonged to the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library that would be equal to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Václav's death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the capture of the castle by the Hussites. But several codices were saved. Today, the Austrian National Library owns most of them.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On Saturday, the public holiday, an exhibition called What's hiding under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will be open for free in Klementin.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population at all levels is, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be stripped of the office of president and the ability to assume it again.
However, as others have mentioned, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure if shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for an entire year is increasing
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce their sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven't had sex in the past year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been without sex in the last year.
Among unmarried people it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people and married people under 35 continues to decline.
Young people have a divided opinion on premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the 'less religious', the trend rose from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"So it turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finances than the reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly larger share of wrong answers," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and, in third place, from lessons at school (21 percent).
It is mainly women who consult their parents about questions about finances, while men are more likely to look for information on the Internet. Getting financial information from parents prevails among young people of all ages, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of the upbringing of children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. That is why the level of financial literacy of parents, who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring, is key," said Palendalová.
94 percent of young people prefer savings and investments.
Young people are clearly concerned with the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or apartment, or to enjoy yourself and rather spend money, without saving and owning your own home.
The strategy of savings and investment in long-term tangible assets is recognized by 94 percent of those interviewed. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The survey strategy is 100% supported by married people with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income of over 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
The whole covid vaccination mandate is about whether or not society should force a segment of the population into behavior that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, and I am personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
I.e. for example, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think that we are to blame for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, mutters something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
Brno Grand Prix? Ticket prices are at risk
The most expensive item is the registration fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food and entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," assessed economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno doesn't have that many international tourist attractions. The grand prix attracts visitors there from abroad as well. It is just as important for Brno as, for example, the Turan airport or the exhibition center. And these are projects that are supported by public money," added the economist.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns
- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing registration fee for promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is beneficial for Brno. "The Grand Prix siphons money from public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent it is a political, and not an economic, issue," he thinks.
In the future, however, the costs of a motoring event may be even higher. There is an option to increase the registration fee almost twice.
"The situation is not closed, we have to try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst scenarios were to come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic that the city and the region paid the extra amount," admitted Brno mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prize. "Dorna's condition is that the advertisement must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in future years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to that," said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"That was a great school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dance there. Since I have something Romani in me from my dad, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the series První krok in the role of a painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have tempted him a lot. "The work was demanding, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot of filming was also done in the Southern Town in Prague," he said to the Czech-German co-production film.
Even though he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the highlight of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around for now. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, saying that he did not even think about the acceptance speech in case of victory. "No, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined myself talking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really did. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn't long before he was on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop called Venture Stairs where he taught how to safely fall down stairs at VIP events. "
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. To begin with, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, many countries have committed to this as part of the Paris Agreement. The Central American country, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of global emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to go fully renewable by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official tourism organization states that already around 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica ran on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica is proud of almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region and around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can be proud of almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot considering the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or cloud forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in recent times in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské Padesátka, for example.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about pan-girls.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across town to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked along one such rather wide street, and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she was saying to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts to cross the (illegal) border.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
A vandal vandalized the cemetery in Dobruška
According to the notification received by the police, the vandalism on the scattering meadow inside the Dobruš cemetery should have happened on Wednesday between 1 pm and 5 pm.
"The material damage was estimated at 60,000 crowns. The police ask any witnesses to the event to share their knowledge in person at the office or by phone on the toll-free line 158," said police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná.
Criminal investigators are investigating the case as damage to another's property and disorderly conduct, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already being driven by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took her driver's license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
The Slovaks succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in its appeal against the closure of the stadium due to the racism of the fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualification match with Wales without spectators, instead the union will now only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee has punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behavior of the fans during their recent qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting team of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. It closed the stadium for both associations for one match and fined Slovakia 20,000 euros and Hungary 67,000 euros.
After the appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15,000 euros for insulting political shouts. The next match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship against Wales on October 10 in Trnava will thus be made available to the fans.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, commemorative procession were accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of the university in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite an extensive investigation, the case has not yet been clarified. The students were reportedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial procession was held in the Mexican capital on Thursday as families wanted to express their frustration at the continued failure to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
However, the mostly peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, they didn't even bother to destroy monuments, they started fires and smashed windows in the city.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to catch him and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but not a single one of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, and investigators allegedly tortured the suspects, APTN adds.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce's cheesy film Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film Tady hlídáme we is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film Tady hlídám ja from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with the storytelling process in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process by a dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and immediately sits curled and made-up with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slop like a cured vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters' characters and the point, and directorial leadership.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
No matter how Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only plus point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog talk, let alone the more popular profanity the characters commit.
Even years of membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club are not an argument - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from idiots just like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to kids like that, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of a hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees were not enough
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency during the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to Jan Papež, vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three variants of possible solutions - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which one of them it will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will depend on the German owner," said CTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, CK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own money, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised to make payments to its clients, according to Pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases when the local hotel kicked out all the tourists of the office. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German and who to the Czech company. That is why he threw everyone out of the hotel, even though the domestic Neckermann provided a guarantee," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to 995 million crowns last year, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the other hand, the company's net profit decreased by roughly seven million to 15.3 million crowns. However, the company had an unreimbursed loss of almost 103 million crowns from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasím Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is abrupt and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater resource, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation here may decrease," predicted in 2018 the spokeswoman for the Israel Water Management Authority, Uri Schor.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tanker trucks on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."

About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The museum in Semile returns to the velvet revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalization room with a television showing footage of the brutal police intervention against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also in the new exhibition of the museum in Semile, which is devoted to the velvet revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semile after the events on Národní třída," said exhibition curator Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the fact that the first demonstration was held in Semily on November 22, and then every day more people were gradually arriving," he said. Among the most active from the beginning was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečkovys, who circulated the Several Sentences petition. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also created relatively quickly. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.
About 50 photographs should draw visitors into the happenings in the city at that time, the pictures were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, has also been preserved and will be played on a loop throughout the duration of the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semil archive also lent a number of preserved banners from that time to the exhibition. "On them was: Let's not get drunk on a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some of the changes in the city were very quick at the time, for example already in December, people decided in a nationwide vote that the square would be Riegrovo and canceled the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what happened before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the museum of the workers' movement at the time," said Chvátal . One room is meant to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household back then.
The last part of the exhibition is dedicated to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the banner of OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for his community," added the curator.

If the lessee, in accordance with the law and this contract, allows a third person to use the thing, he is liable to the lessor for the actions of that person in the same way as if he used the thing himself.
VII. Termination of lease
When handing over the thing, the lessee is entitled to separate and take away everything that he put into the thing or brought to it at his own expense, if this is possible and if this does not deteriorate the essence of the thing or if it does not make its use unreasonably difficult.
If the apartment disappears during the lease period, the lease ends.
If the apartment is partially destroyed during the lease period, the tenant has the right to either a reasonable discount on the rent, or can terminate the lease without notice.
Termination of the lease requires a written form and must reach the other party.
The notice period runs from the first day of the calendar month following the day the notice was sent to the other party.
In the case of termination by the lessor, the latter is obliged to inform the tenant of his right to object to the termination and to propose a review of the legality of the termination by a court.
The lessor may terminate the lease within a three-month notice period only for the reasons specified in Section 2288 of the Civil Code, and is obliged to state the reason for termination in the notice.

The lessor has the right to terminate the lease without a notice period in accordance with § 2291 of the Civil Code.

a. if he has not paid the rent and service costs for a period of at least three months,
b. if it damages the apartment or house in a serious or irreparable way,
c. if it otherwise causes serious damage or inconvenience to the lessor or the persons who live in the house or
d. if he uses the apartment illegally in a different way or for a different purpose than was agreed upon.
If the lessor does not state in the notice what he sees as a particularly serious violation of the tenant's duty, or if he does not invite the tenant to eliminate his objectionable behavior or illegal situation within a reasonable time before the notice is delivered, the notice will not be taken into account.
The tenant is obliged to hand over the apartment to the landlord on the day the lease ends.
The apartment is handed over when the lessor receives the keys and otherwise nothing prevents him from accessing and using the apartment.
If the tenant leaves the apartment in such a way that the lease can be considered terminated without any doubt, the apartment is deemed to have been handed over immediately.
The tenant is obliged to hand over the apartment in the condition in which he received it, regardless of normal wear and tear during normal use and defects that the landlord is obliged to remove.
The tenant is obliged to remove the changes made in the apartment with the consent of the landlord, if the parties have agreed that at the end of the lease, the tenant will return the apartment to its original state.
The tenant is obliged to remove the changes in the apartment that he made without the consent of the landlord, unless the landlord informs the tenant that he does not request the removal of the changes; the tenant cannot still request compensation, even if the value of the apartment increased with the changes.
The lessor may request compensation in the amount of the decrease in the value of the apartment, which was caused by changes made by the lessee without the consent of the lessor.
Equipment and objects fixed in the walls, floor and ceiling of the apartment, which cannot be removed without an unreasonable decrease in value or without damage to the apartment or house, become the property of the owner of the apartment when they are fixed or inserted.
The tenant has the right to demand that the landlord settle with him without undue delay; this does not apply to what the tenant has done without the consent of the landlord.
The settlement is due no later than the day the lease ends.
The lessor has the right to compensation in the amount of the agreed rent, if the lessee does not hand over the apartment to the lessor on the day the lease ends, until the day when the lessee actually hands over the apartment to the lessor.
If an item remains in the apartment that can be considered to belong to the tenant or a member of his household, the landlord will take care of the item for the benefit of the tenant and at his expense.
If the lessee does not take over the thing without unnecessary delay, the lessor has the right to sell the thing in a suitable way after notifying the lessee at his expense after providing an additional reasonable period for taking over.
This does not apply if it is an item that the tenant or a member of his household has apparently abandoned.
The lessee may terminate the lease if the circumstances on which the parties assumed the lease contract at the time of the obligation's origination change to such an extent that the lessee cannot reasonably be required to continue the lease.
In the event of the lessee's death, the contract is governed by Section 2279 et seq. of the Civil Code.

The skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, they were awaited by plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred even by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators do not complain about lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were blessed by the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná na Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski center in Branná, was full of praise.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within a period of time after experiencing covid-19.
With some exceptions, people are ready for it and prove it with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of the Králové Hradec company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were already almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one fine day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
Another question is elections at all.
If life is crazy here, some traditional V4 maniac can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor published a photo of his bloodied face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, also calls on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labor politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have an especially big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working here for our health care," Harman said.
The police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made him think that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That's all, and the "concentration" at the borders would correspond to that.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague's main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will soon expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be canceled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and traffic will be adjusted on 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the canceled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when express line number 404 will depart.
Lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, has been canceled or newly reduced.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region have been modified.

A healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy's next door or to Lidl a little further.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and quickly buy pizza buns at most and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And these are not trees that you must see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, so sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
It is said that he packed her, not the other way around.
They are the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's those who don't care at all and it jumps out at them even out of a can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match for each other, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a joke, that's what you want, bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as the vice president of the Juventus football club.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalised.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they have only been together for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We too are only people, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and I stand by him just as he stands by me. For better or for worse, Rollins concluded.
The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrod Region) - The estate in Nová Ves u Leštiny in the Havlíčkobrod region opened Pumpkin World today for more than a month. Huge orange pyramids dominate the decorations made of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins. The fall event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins in the Pipk family's seven hectares of fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipks grow many kinds of pumpkins, but the weather hasn't been kind to them in the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some varieties did not come out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some varieties for connoisseurs did not succeed," said Pipková. Nevertheless, you can choose from several types at the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and gouging decorations, to cooking Hokkaido or elongated "spaghetti" pumpkins, to decorative pumpkins of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is hard work. Farmers dig up the plants by hand and harvest their fruits, cutting the pumpkin from the stem with scissors. Pumpkin World has been open to Pipko regularly since 2010, previous editions have attracted thousands of people. Decorations made of pumpkins are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze made of logs. Visitors will also see animals raised on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details about the event are on the farm's website, where the growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. The visitors themselves tell them about other options for preparing pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired," said Pipková. She pointed out that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like pickles.

Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subletting together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know, who will you live with
Apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejlo, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides, it is close to most of the faculties of BUT (I don't know where exactly you get on).
So I've never looked for rent, but I'm a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it out of their own money, or let them follow the state's rules and the state will pay for it.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state subsidy and thanks to that he will be able to learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed himself in this way about a petition action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So, for you, a vote against someone having an abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, it affects five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann is canceling flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r.o., operating under the trade name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, has not filed an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue canceling the planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect approximately 500 clients. According to him, the 800 clients of Neckermann who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic is ensured by their planned flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook's collapse happened on Monday. At the same time, in August of this year, the travel agency concluded an agreement, on the basis of which creditors were to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the amount was to be received from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. Based on that, she should have become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as September 20, it was reported that creditors demanded the travel agency to raise a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal falls apart. On Monday, the company announced that it was bankrupt.
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing/digitizing that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it out of sight, or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in a note that it is unreadable .
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're pulling from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply made up their own mark to match what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
Trump is considering delisting Chinese stocks in the US
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking the permission of Chinese companies to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, dragging the entire market down with it.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to limit US investment in China, the source added. He thus confirmed the report of the Bloomberg agency, which shortly before caused a shock in the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
The Bloomberg agency pointed out that an exact mechanism has not yet been developed that would ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from American stock exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, but he gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been waging a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China should resume on October 10. His goal is to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not threatened, reports the Kremlin. But there is a change of operator in the game
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a back-up plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract is legally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another provisional solution in case the tender is not completed on time. Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) stated this on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) banned the implementation of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the services of operating the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the minister.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the toll currently being prepared, which will be launched from this December, in the tender. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not have time to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on previous experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex procurement procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the period of 12 months set by it," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the collection of tolls for a temporary period until the state finds a full-fledged solution.
Apparently, the state will not yet use the offer that the current toll administrator Kapsch presented to it in recent days. The Austrian company offered the state the operation of the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believes that a backup plan will not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.
On Thursday, the ÚOHS issued a decision in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will only come into effect one year after the authority's decision becomes legal. This is not valid and an appeal against it can be filed with the chairman of the office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
In last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
"Scary study result." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable mistrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favor of greater monitoring of centers of Islam.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," claims the author of the study, Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a danger that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed."
The critical attitude is less pronounced among believers. Aschauer claims that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help blunt polarization.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university education or seniors over 75 years of age. On the other hand, Green voters, people under 30 and university students are the most welcoming.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has approximately 8.7 million inhabitants. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
I don't understand the hate for Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has almost never set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they are not allowed :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasova's words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, claims Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
"A travesty of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik participated with other scientists in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health. It concluded that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in local residents.
The scientists mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer much more often than the international average.
Erdogan is taking revenge for the coup, despite international criticism
It seemed to Sika that despite the clear conclusions of the study, the government was not taking any action on the matter. He therefore wrote several articles about the research for the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently started prosecuting him for divulging classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that directly concern public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing whistleblowers through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health issue," said Andrew Gardner of AI Turkey.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
After a failed coup in 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a sweeping wave of arrests. Almost 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet newspaper employees. The authorities also placed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces out of service or outright dismissed.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I know of no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they can't afford it, so only firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is the fault of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czechia is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture are also recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also intensifies the impacts.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveler Zikmund or General Boček. The Senate distributed commemorative medals
Ninety-six-year-old Boček, who was a British Air Force fighter during the Second World War, thanked all the awardees for their medals. "The Senate was one of the first that did not forget and does not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let's not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we like it or not. After all, our successful present is based on these values," said Kubera.
The awardees were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of Tomáš Bata University in Zlín Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveler and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, president of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The Upper House praised his heroism - in January this year he saved the lives of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter by pulling them out of a burning car. The former presidents of the upper chamber, Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch, also received medals.
Together with Jiří Hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a lot of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and broadcast director of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with public media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and screenwriter, the musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission for supervising the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
Astronomer and emeritus head of the UN Office for Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, received the medal ahead of time, in July on the occasion of his hundredth birthday. Before the end of the year, the Czech native and the first US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia, are to receive the same award.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! where is meghan
Diana was exceptional in that she could capture people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, the minefields. Images of him wearing a protective suit and a face shield have become iconic. Even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later the princess of human hearts would take her last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry also scored when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to a demining site in Dirico, Angola, also donning a special protective suit and looking very pensive as he did so. He certainly couldn't resist the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost when he was only 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in war-torn countries. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community to find peace, which also brings opportunities," he said, appealing also to save and maintain wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention her on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to be able to visit the place and community that were so important to his mother, learn about their tireless mission and speak for all of whom (Diana) felt that the most they needed to be heard, even though the issue wasn't popular worldwide," Sussex Royal said in a post on Instagram.
But royal fans may be disappointed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip to remember Diana. Both of them have a separate program from Harry since Wednesday, apparently for their protection. After all, taking a small baby into a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family in danger at any cost.

Yes, it will be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what it's like to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also generally a hoot.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "llama China", losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they point out, what the referees notice or do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czechia lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800-meter run, and pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková failed to qualify, defending the eighth place she surprised the year before in London.
The start on Friday will also be completed by hurdler Vít Müller, and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters on her third attempt and was almost six meters short of her best this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, the limit of 460 cm had to be overcome.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only at the last moment thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run in the penultimate sixth place, and even her time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semi-finals. She fell short of her best this year by one and a half seconds. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the corner, which took a lot of my strength. I thought I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start again, so in this one was a little uncomfortable. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was happy that she overtook at least one rival in the finish line. "She really wasn't doing well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. Winnie Nanyonda of Uganda was the fastest half-distance runner in the heats in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best octogenarian of recent years, Caster Semenya from South Africa, is missing. She has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but like some other runners, she refuses the treatment that is required by the IAAF rules starting this year.
In the 100-meter races, the American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favorite, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one to break under ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is trying to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is number two in this year's tables with a performance of 9.86, did not start, and his fight with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season, was expected.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría already showed great form in the long distance qualification, who reached a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in World Championship qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's charts with a performance of 865 cm.
The Slovenians also defeated the Polish world champions and are in the finals of the EC
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the premier title of European champions. With the support of almost 12,000 boisterous fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Who they challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact than the Polish world champions in the semi-finals. They only had the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players excelled in defense and of the players in the red and white jersey, only León, a native of Cuba, scored points.
On the other hand, in the home line-up, both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the lackluster Gasparini, were in top form. The Poles paid for the fact that they had won all their previous games at this Euro, while the Slovenians were gaining confidence after tough play-off battles with Bulgaria and Russia.
In August of this year, the Slovenians lost 1:3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualification in Gdańsk, but they avenged their defeat at home. But now Stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the EC four years ago.
At the previous European championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, only behind the Czech national team.
Kind to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at a model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Department of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is otherwise not open to the public," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Department of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissection room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go over to the ČZU and watch the movie Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "kind to the planet".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections were registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said on television on Sunday, Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser for the UK Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omikron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labor leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is growing in Britain to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During a strict lockdown in London last December and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of constituencies to profit from it, and does other small and big tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from decided precincts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you speak of?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.

I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely hard (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now I at least hit something to relieve myself, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand for example (so that I wouldn't get too hard on the handle), so never anything extreme, but always I have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but my education certainly has a part to play.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible to at least not a little cold, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call those that the laws create in such a quality as kundas.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage?

The researchers are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect, so-called ankle valgus, for their study
Ankle valgus is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is usually treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis in order to map the effect in both groups. At the same time, participating in the research will not have any risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies HIM.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website, where a registration form and all information are available.
The researchers are looking for fifty children with the diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is the moment when they start taking their first independent steps, typically they start, for example, the furniture that they are holding on to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps , each lasting about 20 minutes, for half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested shoes," points out Gimunová.
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused in the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges the Hradec defender Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play against the club where he recently worked in Friday's game. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the shirt of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta," says the defender from Hradec Králové before the match of the 5th extra league round.
In it, Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which at the moment includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno and Pilsen came the most appreciated by the fans on Sunday, Mountfield traveled to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't look at the matches that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them as well, if not better," the Hradec defender points out.
Hradec Králové should not even look back at last year's balance with Sparta. They lost in three out of four matches, taking points only once after the victory in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's management brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta always had quality players, but what are we talking about, this year they are really loaded," admits Nedomlel before the first match later this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.

Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?

Lucia Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she had to do for a living!
Who doesn't know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is a seamstress by profession and her real name is Hana Zaňáková probably doesn't live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in the cultural center in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That's when a singer was born in me," she admitted to Impulsu radio.
However, her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and therefore advised her to take the path of a trade that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Keep your feet on the ground!' He even persuaded me if I wanted to go to the local glass factory. The glass factory no longer works, I'm fine. I'm a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and use the money to buy wheelchairs," she added with a laugh.

Jan Šindelář's comment: Managing railways as a company
Heaven's election, although apparently not completely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give a clear direction to the roads. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, that did not change, as one of the members resigned. The provisional lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the beginning, already because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly eased. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have been reduced. At first, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board only played the role of pimps.
Nebeský probably presented the weakest professional resume of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those in question already know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in a political game.
Maybe Nebesky will surprise, show great talent and end up being the best lane boss ever. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political tabloids. České dráhy does not have an easy time ahead, they have to cope with competition during the liberalization of the market and with a lack of employees in operation. Train drivers, shifters and mechanics are missing. What motivation are they supposed to have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant in china in the top management?
The second important group are creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the railways next spring, when the railways defend their rating. What is certain is that lenders perceive instability. It is sad that every year someone else goes to the Moody's agency to defend the rating on behalf of Czech Railways. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in railway management and the political influence on the company, it criticized them already this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement is coining the slogan that the state must be managed like a company. For a start, it would be enough if one large state-owned company was managed as a company, and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country, and it would be good if it were led by the best. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive ourselves the antics with the selection process.

The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments expect from the law a significant strengthening of their options when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
Municipalities particularly criticize the draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before starting specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal of the substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permit procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in some permit procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is approximately 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who simply pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient municipal rights for such a fundamental construction in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep storage unites 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, the doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fatty from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to creak.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to take it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal or university text, I would probably be looking for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, so "boss" is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It's probably not even possible to translate boss in one word at a time, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent, is interesting).
In short, it is generally significant to the story or the game, a computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous ones and watching over the completion of some level or task.
And where are the viewers? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, because by going to Doha, athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the captivating atmosphere that reigned in the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings," say the organizers.
But that is too little.
The upper walkway of the Khalífa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colorful tarpaulins, on which the flags of the 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar has ventured into territory where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it does not have deep roots.
Let's not be surprised that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for the ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, i.e. converted to almost 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal that the uncovered parts of the stands are at least half full. Therefore, according to the sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) give free tickets to migrants who work here as laborers, as well as to children. Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF athletics association, can also comment positively: "This is how we can inspire the next generation."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, after athletics it will be football's turn in 2022. Financial offers from an oil powerhouse will always be lucrative even for rich sports federations. Such is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we approach it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't resist a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by the IAAF leaders - and for a different year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the entire scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus also the preparation for the key Olympic season, which under normal circumstances would already start in October for athletes.
Hopefully, Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations, with the help of which they promise an ultra-modern and attractive championship. Is it 37 degrees right now? Already now, the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are supposed to show TV viewers in detail what is happening inside the athletes in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
He has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czechia before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month attacks significantly intensified as the end of the year approached.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to attract the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
Malicious code actively searches for saved credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is increasing again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and in November security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still responsible for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts note a significant decrease and dampening of activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's bunch of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Based on footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are growing in popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy upside down.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say which movement could be bribed out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or center-right movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to revaccinate every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, of which humanity is justifiably proud.
The stalemate is over, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption We Continue Change movement, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
It has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The footage taken "secretly" is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or the member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumper (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person as violating copyright with her paintings.
But the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumper's rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
Microplastics found their way into human intestines, a study confirmed for the first time
The scientists' suspicions of several years have been confirmed. A team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl of the University of Vienna has published a study that proves the presence of microplastics in human feces for the first time. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia, small plastic particles between 50 and 500 micrometers in size were found in the samples of all the people examined. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid marine fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food wrapped in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are created by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the human digestive system has only been officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
Of course, lay and scientific awareness knows that this is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. "This is the first study of its kind and it confirms what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep increase. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years humanity will consume a fifth more of them than today. The current pace is a staggering million bottles bought per minute. About eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Litter threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already taken steps towards restrictions and other measures, Kenya for example - under the threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering minor bans (a well-known straw), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, claim that such measures are nice, but completely insufficient.
