In Kherson, people again came to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the agency the participants of the event, Kherson managed to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now there arrived the technique of the Russian Federation", - said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, residents traditionally gathered for protests on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the Regional Council.
This square, as well as the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City".
February 24, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Hello^^ I'm sick so it'll be better to reschedule our meeting next weekend, sorry.
I know how to cook, the main thing is that there was a recipe, but I like to bake pastries.
In Ukraine, the traditional is borscht, dumplings, others.
I don't have any favorite dishes, I like to try different dishes from different countries.
What are your food preferences? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop beating – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the de-occupied territories.
"Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights – we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have a weaker position.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) – people who pulled a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Sadly, we are concluding.
We believe in our results, in our victory.
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "We must not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have one."
People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we are not talking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, there's no people.
Hello, do you still have free places for the Czech course for adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the aesthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state of

The dining room needs a code
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in the city of Kyiv. Bucha Kiev region.
As Ukrinform reports, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, who are directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Kyiv. "Bucha," the message reads.
In the GUR MOU note that for the crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list by the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated towns and villages, mass killings of civilians by the Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk said that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Kyiv region liberated from Russian invaders.
February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and bombs.

place, day and time will be specified according to the interests and opportunities
We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have the money for two months of rent, in the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. This is exactly what I was waiting for with sadness...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never doubted that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGBist regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy from the shooting case of his great-grandfather: the whole matter is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was from free people, poor "one-yard" nobility, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had a few cows was enough to condemn the pahar and feeder of young children to death.
The relatives did not know the place of the funeral.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and wouldn't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB whistleblower .
The apple does not fall far from the tree, as you know...
The firing squad that doomed the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia excellent (without sarcasm) information resources like "Immortal barrack", qualitatively reminding of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers – the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
As if on the computer found files with child pornography, for her put in jail, and there quickly died.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you surprised by their actions now!
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
Over the millennial Horde tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were superimposed.
And then over what happened, they made a brutal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of the red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.
Aww did you see my pics in the swimsuit
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from cough.
Sorry because I have no one to ask
I also wanted to ask maybe you know where the children went, because Galya can not find them
Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (He is outgoing and can go, because the car today is not yet looked at the station).
We are not comfortable bothering you so much.
You are very helpful, thank you!!
In Borodyanka near Kiev during the dismantling of the rubble of two multi-storey residential buildings found the bodies of 7 civilians.

Three people were injured.
About 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada imposed sanctions on 33 enterprises of the defense sector of Russia.
Over the past day, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of automobile equipment, one helicopter and three drones were destroyed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine.

Yesterday all went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as a Fpoint employee, the first question was how the dog was found, how the pug was found.
Everyone follows the Facebook page.
We asked you to say hello and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, what privileges they have in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if a child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them by phone.
I need to change bed linen, 2 sets.
It suits me exactly on holidays.
I have free time, and we go only to Easter ceremonies.

So in Nestor so far, only the darkness and in Galinka the temperature is 37.7 dinner 38
General Chapek is very slow in the queue.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know about Europe, but in our country people marry for various reasons, mainly for selfish, mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I do not love a person, nothing will happen.
Yes, we took home and took the aunt right away.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
Said if it was possible there would still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I'm very grateful to you, too.
I really felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had a lot of questions to God, why in my life there are situations that just made me despair of everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.

As reported by "European truth", writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the Ministry of economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the variant on the Boxer APC for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be held in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered in 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is it the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?
Thanks we will find how to replenish ryahunoe and naberkmo. I'll unsubscribe. Thank you
I go to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and when my doctor recovers I will pass the commission right I understand?

A man and a woman themselves decide issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are around.
Why not try it this way

I don't know, sweetheart, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together. That we are a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
I'm not afraid I won't find her there.

Because with these excarsions we didn't even talk about it!
I know how important it is for you!
And I'm silent about myself (for me it's just the pinnacle of what not to comprehend)!
How are you feeling today? After the celebration?
hello, sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well
Sorry to bother.
I was disappointed that Kolya and I started translating the test badly yesterday.

If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Kole so that it was without errors.
Thank you for the test
We hope so too
And so she is very pleased with any gift
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.

Are you going out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the privilege to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation – it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.
If the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes, then for us Germans there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For over a month, Germans see it in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" is not just about opposing the swastika.
This means to fight with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its member countries - for the late delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "The Bloody Questions", together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain. Why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever before in history and why the security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner marked that my Application is pending.

Yes, it was a heart disease.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then a short time later he called that he had undergone heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
Then I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
He asked me to get married, and he died two days later.
Therefore, God himself decided our fate.

The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "before not done this"
Konashenkov's direct speech: We see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously refrained.
The Russians have been launching missile strikes on Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Pozniaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV tower in Dorohozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, debris of a downed missile destroyed a house and a trolleybus in Kurenivka, Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vynohradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinohradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said on April 13 that it was too early for residents of the capital to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition on the outskirts of the capital a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to carry out a number of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgoroda stated that a "Ukrainian shell" had allegedly fallen near the town.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing in a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky is not speaking so much to them as to their voters and society in general.
With his speeches in parliament and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of power, touching and sometimes despair, gradually achieve their goal.
While the same Biden is strongly against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be seen as a crook.
The money you collect is better given to people in greater need.

There is hope... It's not for long.
Now....agree...something will happen .
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go?? I don't have anybody anywhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent at home.
Many of our top executives in our jobs have not been paid a living wage .
Where should I go?? Who needs me? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from home... You're going to go 1,000 miles.
You don't know if you'll have them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.

These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractor drivers, who actually under fire go into the field, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree today to go in humanitarian convoys to the temporarily occupied territories in order to carry aid there and take people away from there.
These are heroic leaders who go to the war zone without fear, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into wagons.
These are the tankers that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that under fire take out garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits to the front.

Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (HEI of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting facilities at Ukrainian embassies and consulates and facilities at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and DR Congo).[1] The role of the District Election Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the Foreign Electoral District, only national voting is held: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not held in the ZVO.

Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is it?
Head of the President's Office Andrey Yermak said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" on weapons that are being handed over to us by allies.
"They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness and seek to "knock down" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is allegedly the destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can run fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to warn you of such fake news.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Excuse me please, forgot to ask how much does the garden cost per month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has dismissed the reports as a "provocation."
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida described the incidents as a "breach of international law".
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and dumped in mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops. who left the area after being occupied for several weeks.
Photos purportedly showing the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied have shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were indications that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha was "another production of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
Russia's Investigative Committee issued a statement on April 4 announcing an "investigation" into allegations that Ukraine had spread "deliberately false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... "Shot in the back of the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of alleged civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a site that locals said was being used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appeared to have been killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in an area of Kiev that had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, we have everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupants sneakily exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: looting, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item in this list, about which there is much less information now – the removal of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Around mid-March, the Russian occupiers "evacuate" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainska Pravda" found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is going and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text embarked on a voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was a civilian.
As true scouts, Denys and Marina collected alarming suitcases in advance, but they did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They didn't have their own car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone.
At about 12 o'clock on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighbor's house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, "Who is?" – I say yes. "Out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned if they had served in the army.
The women were told: "We came to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen riot police, not even the troops, young men aged 25-35.
They said, "We were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bilyi. (He commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war – UP) Now we are here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, she had a big problem.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same Russian take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they after the looting of the store brought sausages and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have seven days to give away our phones" - they laughed.
They have always separated themselves from the Russians.
They said that it was good that they came, because they did not want the war, they support Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, and went to loot shops, looted.
Chickens brought themselves, one tied to one leg of the St. George ribbon, and the other – his white tape and called it "popolchenko".
They came to Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked ... When they were beaten in Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords in order to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian riot police arrived, and after them – the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses – ours constantly got into it from the "Bayraktars".
But these people came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no more, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov is so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been pushing since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us – either an officer of the landing, or a representative of the FSB – and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we gave our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they responded, "So pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started firing from under the house – either with Grad or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not leave, saying that it was for traitors of the motherland – they say, "you will be shot there, the organs will be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burns, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians were immediately taking the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, they gave us tea.
And here we hear gunshots! The missile is firing, and the trace is visible – it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Monks" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came and said: "Vot, I'm a hohol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stay until they finish your votes.
Poor people are suffering!
Lukaku is so good !
As you say, so be it.
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we did decide to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one will take a bus.
We were very helpful to the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
In the sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, beautifully glows, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians were constantly firing from the ranges.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their ranges are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, we had friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through the registration, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, probably, as much as Estonian ones.
Marina lived on the territory of the military camp in Gostomel with her brother's family – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, could not – the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupants were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some of them were tied hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
The village head of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Oleksandr, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor – in the sewer.
On both sides of the highway 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth".
"All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, it is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different look.
"It would have been different, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that the war would not have happened, - he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio" was delayed because of imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to boo when they call."
"We have been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it is succeeding.
However, Spot (cat – UP) has fur on the belly and hind legs – it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito" for a month.
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
They hid the war from her, and the fact that I was near her – I formally came for a few hours as usual.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hearing badly – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who talked to her. That's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk about anything but war.
I'll ask my girlfriend she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaning :)
Hello, I hadn't thought of that :)

I'm telling you the embassies are the backstops here,
The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British soldier, who is a member of the Ukrainian marine brigade, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family, that they will lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Aydin Aislin, a Briton who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the BBC, citing family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News cited Aislin's friend who spoke to him
Aislin's tweet read: "We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything we could to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We had no food and no ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon.
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists contacted the mother of the soldier Ann Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they planned to surrender.
A friend of the military Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call Aislin said about their unit's plans for surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of the Atlas News publication contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender to the Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrov's" units.
Also in social networks distributed audio recording of the phone conversation, which allegedly Aislin speaks with his friend American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
Aislin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

Very interesting tradition you have, we go so at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the bill 7176, which is called . "On monitoring of potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".
It is strange that in fact the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was... place, for whom the members of the Supervisory Board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but we do not yet know about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear – it is an excellent basis for "destroying" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards. and then install manual control.
The same as before 2015.
Why should the state companies have supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law "flies" under patriotic slogans, then tomorrow others may take off – for example, it is possible to demolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be attributed to war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some MPs for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals on how to solve the issue of management of state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible to remotely work supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by the relocation of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to prevent the Supervisory Board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, it will lead to this!
MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties not free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will make a decision on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because the draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be categorized as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, But let's try to understand some of them: "respected foreign experts at the first word "war", in 2021 leave Ukraine, But at the same time, they remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from the war.
Firstly, this is manipulation – most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in the world practice, and in completely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
Don't forget that being a member of a supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 kids with me.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansk districts of the Kiev region, which were released from the invaders, will introduce a strengthened curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansk districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be in force from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into shelters.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clean up and demining territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There's a word-for-word translation of that document in Czech.
Only below added an explanation of what is inkaso.
I already have an account. I did it at another bank. Because you had to have an account to work.
The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing its army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complicated and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Swaboda Rada", the human rights center "Vyasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevych, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of the SOBR special forces, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Vyasny", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of Belarus will be severely stopped" by the security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway. employee of Baranovichi branch of "BZhD" and administrator of thematic resources "BZhD" in "VKontakte and "Classmates" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus for sabotage was detained at least 40 railway workers.
The formation of BYpol, declared by Lukashenko's regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on the objects of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus in the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the European Union, is imposing new sanctions on Russian President Putin's daughters, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions would freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, President Joe Biden will sign a new executive order that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exodus includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms, the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was the restriction against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
It would prohibit U.S. citizens from transacting with these entities and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council. including former Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the US.

You're happy what you're going to do
Thank you.. found some things,but the technique was nothing ...
Both beginners, except the alphabet know nothing
Nothing is happening.
Can I go on Monday, April 25?
You can bring your children with you, there are enough toys :)
Guessed about daddy
I'm probably very naive or very in love but I'll come up with something with that money .
We'll do it somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credits.
Write to me directly and I'll help.
We are your partner or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should I take what you gave with me?
Today is not my day. The blinds in the living room broke. morning one. now in the evening another
Something came from you,I don't see what
I am also very sad
I'll remind you of the invoice later
Does your dad speak and understand Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many house has windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business
Good evening, I can't share with you. There is a tip from Mariupol for his son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he conducts scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neuron connections
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, posted a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
The military says they have no weapons left to fight and a mountain of wounded people.
They said that "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of marines, which takes part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 may be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyi assured that the command's communication with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defensive operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azov Andrey Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by the Azov regiment.
Thanks, I'll stick with you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, while we stay here
2 hours drive )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she would do here
A squadron of Czech-made drones has started flying over Ukraine from today.
Nearly 50 professional copters will serve to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their intermountain friends led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in the various cities where the fighting is currently underway.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters, the location of their deployment will be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they have done, they say that in the coming days many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, it's all right. I love sweets, but I can do without them
I'm worried we won't get there. Lots of baggage.
I will be returning to Egypt soon and working
Okay. If it's okay, I'll agree
I'll try it myself, but if there are any problems I'll write to you, if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the lady of the elder in the village in Yiviv,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Maybe she will be happy and she will cheer up
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still freezing in the street today.
I took my medicine and tea and felt worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but I'd rather meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me some music you like.
I wonder what your musical overcomings are 🙂
Mom and Dad should listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's pram.
It was cooler and raining here today. It should be warm tomorrow.
But not sorry for the destroyed houses, sorry for the people who are bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupants mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Removed the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we have no such custom so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to give
In Czech there is someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I live in a dormitory typeUntil twelve there will be people, and then go to work
Hello, it's a little better.
I was in the yacht today.

So we're already making big big progress.
I'll be sure to bring the dumplings another time!
I have no power to do them
Since I am pushing away from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can roughly say for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule of cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can say about the end of April or early May.
Just asking if you have anything to say about it..
hi, sorry, that long did not post cooking dinner and a little sleep
If you don't mind, could I come today
We will meet you after your arrival
He's very humble, he's been learning a lot lately. I know he needs it in his life
Hello, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today had a lesson with the lady who is the director of the economics department of the uplands.
She was very happy with my work.
The yacht was well behaved.
On Monday I have to bring the confirmation of employment and also cash payment for yasli.
I'm lazy from Friday
I don't do anything just eat a lot and sleep 🙂 (and drink a lot of water 🙂)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow I'll go with you if I can
I need to do another analysis
and so you don't have to go again
Very poorly working drain tank, poorly washes. We need a master. We need to fix it.
So there is enough
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
Are the children being fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can come to have one question
If you still need help write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't really want you to raise funds from the start so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling I was not enough two points:
I'll go to bed to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
What a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good, because the whole family will be painting.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
You can count on me, thanks!

After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day that I was not at work there is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state".
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
The training of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent station of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyrysche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzia, The 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District is recruiting servicemen from the specified brigade.
The enemy feels a special problem in the recruitment of drivers and drivers.
Departure of selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of warfare, will continue to strike at the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of their destruction or disabling.
Determined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
Aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in the Izyum direction in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault actions in the area of Golden, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue their assault actions in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
The enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops near the settlements of Vysopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
In the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four attacks of the enemy, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
I don't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to keep up, but I doubt
How can you want to sleep and I'm holding you
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, then tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home, and especially 1+1. We don't need to set up :)
I turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
I have a package tariff for a month :)
Can we do that today on the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I know, I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We'll see my dad later, for sure
I read the announcement on Facebook,then apparently Google something on its own has written a letter., I think the phone number is enough
Hello, we are the things that you brought took, but there are things that we small can bring to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director is satisfied, then next week I can start going to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if I get it, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I am learning Czech to perfection, I dream to work at Teva
Friends old and not so, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have come to hard times.
Over the past month, I've talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has been turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame about your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you later – as usual, succinctly answered Sasha. After the search, we walk through the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for very few of you -- those who have worked at Memorial, at Novaya Gazeta, at Echo of Moscow, at Meduga, at Navalny's organization, and in a number of other places -- Have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Except for the rallies, when they were still happening.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, perhaps, a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always that way.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent - messy even bloody but real .
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of sorrow that you seek salvation behind the tsar, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think that it is safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky and allowed the KGB to lie down, to renew itself. To re-form and take over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between looting the country and the return of the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly resigned yourself to the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought into it, but you still either voted for him, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started leveling Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would go back to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're sick of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upswing of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have earned well, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices have risen, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, as I see, you barely paid attention to it.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or were silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything at all.
A bit of outrage, a bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
After the 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you came out in droves to protest.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some people got huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I have heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by a pro-Russian president who had deceived their European aspirations, they seized the Maidan once and never left it again.
They built a tent city entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and kick them out if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general turmoil, he seized the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his shakers suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because we stopped communicating right after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you new hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which began the mayor of Moscow in 2012, with their binbags, public waifai and hipster cafes .
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it is only getting better.
You have barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever ... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I had no idea what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and I saw how on the streets of Homs state snipers shoot in cold blood at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:
"First they came for the socialists, but I kept silent – because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I kept silent – because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent – because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.
How many of you were talking about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really speaking now – like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shyshkin, Mykhailo Zyhar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most of them allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from inside the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, at the risk of getting into a new gulag or joining Navalny.
As for the others, you know best what country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians — or, as seems very likely, if he doesn't — he'll take you up on it.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly in private, went to protests and still took a short time, but soon will get more serious.
For the thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent on social media (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment was given simply for anecdote, are not in the distant past – and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who's going to stay?
The example of Ukrainians, even more than in 2014, frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive on paper his superiority.
All in all, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on at all.
But you, my friends, know what is happening.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
The good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hogwash , your laws , apart from the repressive ones , are worth no more than the paper they are written on , your last free media is no more , your economy is collapsing faster than I write . you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to leave somehow, or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: because of the economic collapse that is looming in Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the rallies by itself, as it has periodically happened, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool, the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged in almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many, many millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300,000, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
It's natural, it's normal.
I would be scared if I were you too.
In the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but actually try to win it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet and be arrested; Your close friend will make a mistake and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years and will only continue to get worse and bigger.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be home

She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room for her yesterday until 19:00.
