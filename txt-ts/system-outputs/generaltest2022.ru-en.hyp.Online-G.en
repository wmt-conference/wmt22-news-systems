From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age based on their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torments of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes at all.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to represent a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this color and with such a petal structure resembling velvet, usually dark red, burgundy tones.
And light roses look different, the petals have just a satin or silky shine.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
The model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft – a slab of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of a "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is assigned to the removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow to pair with the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides – coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on the brain and drive such relatives back!
It's better not to have any than these...
Either look for a third-party driver, or someone who is willing to invest and work with you in a share.
If it does not work out, then sell the car, albeit at a loss, do not regret it.
You'll think better next time...
Andrey, it was clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher will not be able to help either, he was not taught this, the schoolboy plays games in Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still being fried on the stove, the disheveled mother is cleaning the floor.
My God, I was already exhausted at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you carry groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
And what about the guests?
It's good for them, they also have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at a minimum.
And I cook them delicious things, bake them very often just like that.
Germany: The fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, Die Welt reports.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with flu vaccination."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of a new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
Moreover, the new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with a new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet–A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not just for fishing for the edge.
These vibes have a larger specific gravity than their similar-sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing in a plumb line, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the fishing rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space cluttered with underwater vegetation, driftwood and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for walleye and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive bait feed is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to tease a passive pike with a plumb line game, which does not react even to live bait.
When fishing, the Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and braided cords even of large diameters.
For fishing for pike, walleye, ruff or perch, in addition to uniform, a "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chirping" along the bottom.
If you are fishing in tight spots, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the baits of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively shallow and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are sitting on the neck of old parents.
The "golden youth" are clearly lazy for the most part, who do not know how and do not know anything.
A well-fed life disposes to idleness.
Perhaps Mishustin was referring to this considerable part of the population.
You must be joking.
I have never seen shoes in this store that I would like to buy.
What kind of long-term sock are you writing about?
This shoe is made of leatherette.
It's good if one season can stand it.
"Senden" is on the same level as "Kari".

7 thousand Russian mercenaries were announced in Libya
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company "Wagner" in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the Wagner PMCs in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet planes at Gardabia air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), " Anadolu agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and a port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency's publication notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMCs enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the formulary lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this background, the Supreme Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia TV channel reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of success - "they defended in Syria, restored peace there", "the decision on the Nord Stream-2", "the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons", "We squeezed the Crimea".
The main failures are "the conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," "isolation from the world," according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper paperwork - all public services have also become digital only
The Government of Dubai announced the complete abandonment of paper paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, this is already insanity, about the class and the group in kindergarten, too.
Well, I don't believe there are such bunglers.
And if they do, then they obviously don't care about anything, including the family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandparents lived on 3 Vladimirskaya, there was a 1st floor without bars.
They knocked first on the door, then on the window, then decided not to stand on ceremony, broke the window and climbed in, but grandfather had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports have fallen below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports declined sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry indicators for the first 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector showed positive dynamics compared to last year, then by the end of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs have received a deferral on loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA Kazinform reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferred payments on loans of small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted, - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including sole proprietors, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
The borrower's application could have specified a different payment deferral period.
During the postponement period, the claim work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the lender were suspended in relation to the borrower," the deputy prime minister said.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferral of payments on loans from 603 borrowers-SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs have applied for deferral in MFOs, of which 95 entities have been granted deferral in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the okmiron strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the okmiron strain of coronavirus can be dangerous.
The reason is worth looking for in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, when mutated, he did not meet any resistance from the immune system.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - says pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "okmiron" more easily than those with a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is how it happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old old people endure it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is frenzied in the young, it is completely inadequate: where you could only shake your finger, it hits like a cannon at sparrows," concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin to be vaccinated by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the Laboratory of Genomic Engineering at MIPT, noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarten students," Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the Laboratory of genomic Engineering at MIPT, told Moscow 24.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I was happy to refresh my memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, not a single dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, we arranged dances to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of covid
The authors studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the response of the immune system.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FSAOU at the RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Cognitive Disorders Department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return home about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Now the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that after returning, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally exported from the country at various times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the USA, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the information about the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, he has spat with imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, at times he is strongly scolded by critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets Sergey Alexandrovich has ever received such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip the family life, to support sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Is it like a grove in September,
Alcohol is showering the brains.
Many friends noted that Yesenin has passed badly, looks bad, is clearly ill.
Spree, nervous breakdowns are increasingly repeated.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin would get to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's binge drinking, scandals on this ground, drives to the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, the imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he lived in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev remembers:
"I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
After recovering a little, he began coughing incessantly, spraying the whole sheet with blood..."
Yesenin himself, after a voyage to Europe and the USA (there was a prohibition in the States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), confessed:
"I didn't see anything there, except pubs and streets...
I've already stopped remembering people by the end...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because I was bored."

A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl burst into tears at the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school.
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
Retake.
Millions of students know this.

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenka," but he is "actively searching for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As the site wrote kp.ru Earlier, the European Union put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"The hat is not for Senka": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
Velvet jackets dominated the social events of 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "It's not time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that did not comply with the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiahs tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, received by "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model is considered to be Gucci, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a fleecy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, they serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its relevance.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a special event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is specified in the invitation.
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced hangout with prosperity," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell" believe. - The owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from the "Handsome Brummell" are sure that the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then - "yes," such a thing is in the subject for him."
If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "the hat is not for Senka," the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it pulls so painfully.
And it is absolutely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not at a disadvantage - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And then who is in the gap?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will most likely not get hooked on such.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his servile position and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and vegetates in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose mouth is watering when he complacently describes the delights of slave life and admires a kind and good master is a slave, a cad."
The immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the omicron strain of coronavirus
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, a "very long period"
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been vaccinated twice and a booster, or he has been ill and vaccinated, or vaccinated and has been ill, then he has received "hybrid immunity", that is, there are a lot of antibodies and neutralizing enough," the expert said.
The Big Seven warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the Foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further urge Russia to "ease the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities," as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer's vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective from the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the initial variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Defense Minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they expect that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," reads a statement published on the website of the British government.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that "they are united in their condemnation of the Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."
British Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss at a press conference in Liverpool warned of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).

Revealed ways to return money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to return the money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is assigned to the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone 11 thousand appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz stated his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia may use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of Nord Stream 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
US officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior US congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".
Dmitry, take a closer look.

In general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout doubt.
And I know such apartments very well and I see perfectly well how it was redeveloped.
May all be well with them.
It always surprises when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, or something, that you have to wash them straight.
Just don't let it get dirty.

There are some citizens who, by their decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medications without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will find wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and receipts under the insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is connected with a theft that occurred at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
That's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not that "she is financially much richer than all the scribblers," as they write here.
There are richer people, but not everyone behaves as brazenly, as defiantly as this madam.

In Brazil, they were obliged to require covid passports from those entering the territory of the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate from vaccination.
Also, the list of exceptions includes people who have arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered tourists unvaccinated from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection against COVID-19 is revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru he revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
With internasal use , immunoglobulins A are formed in large quantities . When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most G immunoglobulins (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet," the medic said.
The chief preventologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help because in this case, the body's protection, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the male (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, affection, love and games for a tech bitch, then go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they would not run after the dog, although they wailed that 200 thousand were running away (remember), I just took them by the hand and led them away in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that was running somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination do not stop in Europe
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the policy of the authorities in the field of health, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards with the words "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the guards.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.

WHO has discovered omicron already in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of a new strain can have disastrous consequences.
The WHO reported on the rate of spread of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has been actively spreading only since the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of a new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the "delta" strain, aka the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that several hundred people are officially ill with omicron at the moment in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at its peak, more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to Omicron - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

Russians were warned about a new fraud scheme
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Product Director of Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools are deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the features of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim's friends via video link or create a video clip with a copy of a person for distribution with the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
The leading system engineer of Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.

Listed are five actions that will help to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to stick to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration of well - being at the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often a "weekend migraine," said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical Sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics suffer especially often from this, who have headaches, bruising and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
On weekends, our life changes radically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a slight withdrawal begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have announced the low effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine against omicron
In South Africa, they announced the low effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine against omicron
Scientists of the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine against omicron, a strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of omicron) corresponds to (the level of) the effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is being questioned," says the text of the study published on the medRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product, hidden sugar may be indicated - an ingredient similar to sugar in caloric content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, in fact, denoting sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other coated sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and to many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues the transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.

Hackers have hacked the Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and also that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that they reacted quickly on Twitter - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India has already been hacked in 2020 and urged to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has become significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, in total more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As the France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago hinders a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of independence of New Caledonia has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean."
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmour repeatedly repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France."

WSJ readers criticized the article about the relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and has made a number of offensive statements against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "present a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "lose", and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," another noted.
Patches can also be applied to the lip area.
Used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch patches, hydrogel is a high-tech polymer that provides increased absorbency and transfer of highly concentrated natural plant essence to the skin, fits snugly to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When transferring nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the concomitant loss of moisture and causes the essence to penetrate into the deep layers of the skin.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The hearth lay at a depth of 92.5 km .
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
ANKA-type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be created at the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant.
This was announced on December 11 by Alexey Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," he quotes Диалог.иа .
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where personnel will be trained, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less at risk of getting some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure to a greater or lesser side.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75 thousand people may die due to the omicron strain by April
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75 thousand people may die in England in the next five months, if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized in total.
At the same time, at the peak of morbidity, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines will not be able to exclude infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed: if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected over the past day.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.
After all, I wanted to write some smart comment, but I read up to this place:

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world register of vessels, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a rush in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of hardship, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to take action and propose introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such a mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement this.
Meanwhile, only the number of super yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a REV Ocean yacht with a length of 183 meters.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
Helicopter pads, open-air cinemas have become common on existing super yachts, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of wrestler McGregor, a platform for martial arts.Richard Wilk, professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic meaning, considering that there are a little more than 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trace was attached to his Eclipse yacht with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not arouse the sympathy of other people when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no berth for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels 50 meters high.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't realize how much four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, however, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poetry, they don't know anything about politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions is not enough yet.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, the United States and Russia are ready to bargain
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the person offering.
And with regard to Ukraine, a bargain is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are carried out covertly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, and do not wait until the group is discovered and counter-forces are deployed," he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said company representative Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains designed in China for export to Europe descended from the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport of the city.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market," Feng Yaoxiang said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway transport equipment, with a full range of auxiliary facilities and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being debated in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, because of which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the doctors' council established under the Ombudsman of Georgia, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychonervative rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging the receipt of medical care after the prison service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia against the mandatory vaccination certificate from COVID-19, the Europa Press agency reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, more than 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a previous illness, or a medical withdrawal from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow collecting the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure, landscaping works are also carried out in the region: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Justin Downs, an adviser on the organization of the Games, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and create the infrastructure necessary for recreation there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the local residents are suffering without work.
More and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Catering outlets with national cuisine dishes are being opened on the slopes.
There is even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiva now.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down the progress of mankind in the issue of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage celebrated on December 12, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health protection systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: the Taiwanese minister was disconnected from the broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technologies Audrey Tan at a panel discussion during the "Summit for Democracy" organized by the United States was switched to a video-free mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Ms. Tan showed was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of ensuring civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted on it in green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam - in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to the "one China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."

And if it concerns other spheres of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
There are no laws written for them.

The Foreign Ministry told about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the results of the long journey that we have gone through with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are connected with the desire of the United States to impose approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the dangers of vaccination with nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine from COVID-19 may have allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping malls.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the Laboratory of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with nasal vaccine at airports and shopping malls, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a chance of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Alexander M., remind me, please, what style was the marathon at the 2021 World Cup?

Attention, the question is - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get to the ski track if he was walking behind at the turn in front of the target?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.

I had the right, but I didn't know how to drive.

During the day, 1,239 cases of infection with a new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in the UK.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin's official representative said on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV .
96.5% of those who voted voted against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of ballots were canceled.
The level of participation in voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO tentatively considers Omicron to be less dangerous than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with delta," the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of infection with omicron in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than delta.
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They "had previously been immunized," the Gamalei Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm", assumes that key Western countries will cease to support Ukraine, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition of the authorities with key financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)," the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former people's deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of the population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
Some event may lead to this, which will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the survey data of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his election as head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-President Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova died, it's very upsetting to find out.
I remember rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorsky Krai, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such a heat of passion, emotions were off the scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy about the rest of the victories, as they were rooting for Salnikov, for the football players, for all Soviet athletes at that time.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there watermelons were rolled up the ladder on board the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself worked many times in my youth cleaning and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the melon and not before the beginning of August.

The lower part of the cup is reinforced with an inelastic transparent cloth.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of sewing the straps, is reinforced with an inelastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the neckline and under the breast.
Vertical bones on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to twist on large sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was evil, poisonous.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "They give 10 days for Yevtushenko's quote, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetvrossyibolshempoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up on Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the general culture in Russia, and there is also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police officers treat you during the arrest this time and earlier?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how funny it might sound in some context of this word.
On Pushkinskaya Street, the riot police took it and took it hard.
They asked standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey house blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if, after the action, at least a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag, I will not serve these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, talk privately at least in the language of the tumba-yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that contribute to improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels.
The root crop contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of the seal, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or cook the root vegetable, rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are foods with a carbohydrate content that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex search results
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEK cluster/Media" has compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet and most of them have ceased to exist, says Karen Ghazaryan, Director General of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks, among other things, to the regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine search results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Univer. 10 years later" of TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media).

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces of different softness – high rigidity and slightly more than average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropacket".
This means that there are 2000 spirals per sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
The "Micropack" is the highest frequency of the whole variety of Dimax spring blocks, therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed on top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, since it transmits not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coir provides proper back support, then latex adapts the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a quilted knitted Aloe Vera case.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.

Orthopedic foam, which is used in the mattress, has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The purpose of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability of the clouds of Venus for life, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Payusalu, the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
On the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want something too greasy and harmful anymore.
Of course, we will have a traditional olivier and a herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one forces me to eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can cook any delicious and healthy dishes.

And the one who did not just do sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell that she went through, DO NOT CLIMB WITH CONDEMNATION.
The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived itself" and it's time to return to a relationship where interest rates adjusted for inflation will correlate with the expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of an ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the global research department of Otkritie Investments, Mikhail Shulgin, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing pleases: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, only sluggish.
There is also such a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
All sorts of ecotaxis that take waste from home.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean Kia brand is the leader in terms of revenue in the Russian market.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Hyundai's sister Kia brand has an even more significant increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the leading positions in terms of increasing the weighted average price of a car - for Hyundai it increased by almost 21% over the year, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had stronger dynamics of price appreciation.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to statistics from the Committee of Automakers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in quantitative terms over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales volume (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good growth in sales and weighted average prices - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabadzhi. -
In terms of sales growth, fantastic figures are demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators in terms of revenue growth dynamics (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red at all - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and production disruptions that have engulfed the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers also regularly rewrite price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially shift to the consumer the costs of previous periods, which they could not put into the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital for the automotive industry. -
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining a high marginality of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which are observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, says Sergey Burgazliev, an independent consultant on the automotive industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to get the greatest profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes. -
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of an "invasion" by Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink incomprehensible stuff and wash another cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without an HR layer, where you immediately talk to the head.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, then it is ineffective to immediately reset it, and it is most likely not possible to blacklist it.
Because in order to confirm his lies about his involvement in law enforcement agencies, he quickly repeats the call and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
That's such nonsense...
I don't believe it was like that at all.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
They got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame, except the most-the most...
And wouldn't it be easier to leave people alone from forced labor, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
Like in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections...

The Oscar-nominated Russian film "Unclenching his Fists" received the award of the European Film Academy (also called the "European Oscar") in the nomination "Best Editing", reports Moskovsky Komsomolets.
The jury of the contest, who voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the filmmakers.
The maximum number of awards was received this time by Yasmila Zhbanich's film (Bosnia) "Where are you going, Aida?"
The main character of the tape is a translator at the UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching my Fists", shot by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of the workshop of Alexander Sokurov), this film tells about the difficult relationship of a domineering father and those who want to be freed from paternal custody of growing up children in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for the Academy Award as the best film made in a foreign language.
As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, out of touch.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
