When I tried to buy the entry package, the blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than double for orange.
What's the difference?
I didn't understand it even after checking it, so please let me know.
There should be only blue now.
If there is, it may be that the old product remains.
Both are the same, only the appearance is different.

Because of that, I don't feel like watching TV anymore ...
Does that mean that the entertainer has become impossible? TV is all about entertainers.
I saw Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there are quite a lot of scenes where the staff laughs behind me even when I say something that is not particularly interesting.
It's obviously not an interesting place, but it's weird to laugh at everything I say because I'm a selling entertainer.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainer's mood will be hurt, and it will be unpleasant for the work relationship.
The industry is like an athletic club like an old black company, and some entertainers' ego seems to be too big and usually have an unpleasant attitude, otherwise you won't be able to eat.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say "Don't lick the entertainer" every time the entertainer feels that his work is difficult.
I know that my income is quite low until it sells, but even if I'm told that a gein is at the top of a messy job category.
Beautifying your own career and laughing It sounds like justification for the entertainers being too high in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is quite tough, but I feel that things that come into contact with the entertainer world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry to complain.
I felt like it wasn't good for me if I didn't go outside like a flatulence ...

Mail order of Ikemoto Brush Industry
Hairbrush stock!
Presenting a sample to the purchaser
The product ordered at the Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: When I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse, I received a wired version of the mouse and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
It's more of a mail-order problem than a topic of home-made PCs, but I'm not convinced by any means and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It all started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (link destination Uotaku) at the Tsukumo Day sale of the Tsukumo net shop that started last Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page considering the possibility of a price mistake and it was 5,071 yen (link destination Uotaku), so I ordered considering the possibility that it was not a mistake
The order email arrived normally, and the next day shipping email also arrived
The name of "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page.
At this point I thought I would receive the ordered wireless mouse because I didn't get any mistakes or cancellation notices between ordering and shipping.
The problem was from here, and a few hours after shipping, I received an email saying "There was a mistake in registering the product."
According to the email
* The wireless version was sold at a special price, but it was actually a wired version.
* We have already shipped a wired mouse, so
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return only mouse and refund
3. Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose your response
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and although the purchase history, email, and delivery note say the wireless version, it seems that I replaced it with the wired version without permission.
Isn't it terrible to send something different from the one you bought without consent and send it back from here if you want a refund?
Even if you accept the refund in the end, please lend me your wisdom because I want to fight back with one shot

Twice isolated ... Typhoon and heavy rain spilled the only bridge leading to the district Residents tripled their food reserves <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) --Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Takachihara district of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
It was the typhoon in East Japan in 2019 that had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first it feels like "Is it serious?"
I was wondering if it would break or be washed away so easily." The only road leading to the Takachihara area, "Takachihara Bridge", was washed away by the typhoon in East Japan, leaving 30 residents in 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut water continued to carry necessary supplies using the JR railway bridge, which is usually not allowed to pass.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually you can come to the garden, but when you get out of the car, you can hold it in your hand or carry it on your back and walk over the iron bridge to come here, so I felt the value of transport and the car." The emergency bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until the temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto is continuing to take measures based on the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I wanted to secure enough food for two to three days. <unk>We have prepared about three times as many foods that can be used as emergency food, such as canned foods and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "I don't know when a disaster will hit me, not someone else's affairs, so I felt once again that I should have a little stockpile or something else." On the other hand, the bridge is washed away. Yamatsuri Town experienced an unexpected disaster.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own efforts in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Chief of Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: "We have announced that we will set it in the form of" Disaster Prevention Day in Yamatsuri Town "and that October 12th will be the day to think about disaster prevention preparations from next year onwards.
I think we've become more aware of the possibilities of unexpected things than ever before."
Article at the time of purchase
The test itself is almost over, so all I have to do is write a sentence, but I'm also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is wrong, so please wait for a while.
You can see that you become less confident in the measurement results
If it wasn't for the Olympics in China, do you think Hanyu's ranking would have changed?

It seems to be the same no matter where you do it.
So it's the same no matter where you do it.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online) --Yahoo! News
● Newly established "building condition survey" system to revitalize the used housing market Used housing transactions are strong.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the remodeling market is also expanding.
While the tendency to own a house is increasing due to Korona-ka, the popularity is concentrated on properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station", "large scale", and "tower", and the number of relatively cheap new properties has decreased sharply. It will also have an effect.
[See the image in this article] However, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still low compared to overseas.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Law and started a building condition survey for the purpose of trading safe and secure used houses, a so-called inspection survey (https: /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect familiar with housing checks the current situation, including deterioration of the property, and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because the seller can avoid complaints after delivery by conducting a property inspection before the sale transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
In turn, it will lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, it is said that the buyer can grasp the condition of the used house to be purchased and can purchase it with conviction, and at first glance it is a system with great merits.
However, due to the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in the building condition survey.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system is obligatory.
In other words, the real estate company in charge of brokerage is obliged to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect who conducts a building condition survey" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not obligatory. It will be.
● Risks of concern in vendor-led inspections On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems have already been put in place in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used market is booming.
It is a system in which the buyer asks an expert called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" to conduct a building survey before buying or selling a house.
In the United States, for example, 70-90% of used home transactions are inspected, depending on the state.
The nature of the inspection is very different from that of the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly the "seller", in that the inspection is led by the "buyer".
The seller side looks at the condition of the building as well as possible and tries to sell it as high as possible and as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the survey, make appropriate repairs, and live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap between the purposes and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, regarding the Japanese system, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern.
● The scope of vendor-led inspections set by the state will be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking a really important defect ● For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that <unk>sontaku<unk> inspections will be conducted, such as not reporting unfavorable findings to the seller.

It was the second time in a year, so I took a rest for about a month and said goodbye to the fucking garbage company.
Anyway, it is important to get a psychiatrist to deal with it correctly and to keep a history of hospital visits (super important).

Was Ginza an island?
5 Trivia You Can Talk While Silver Bra (LEON.JP) --Yahoo! News
"This was a peninsula a long time ago.
It is unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia such as "..." as proof.
Here are some tips on Ginza that are interesting to know and will surely make you want to talk to someone.
Go over Ginza!?
First infiltration in Kinza
As you walk around Ginza, you will find eccentric place names, mysterious stone monuments, numerous shrines, and other remnants of the history of Ginza.
As I was walking in Ginza with her, I suddenly visited the silence and said, "This was a peninsula in the past.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, which is synonymous with the downtown area that created "○○○ Ginza" in various parts of Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" is a silver coin foundry, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was currently located in Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Ryogaecho", but when it moved to Kabukicho, it came to be known as "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to the current Ginza.
When Ieyasu Tokugawa opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the cove and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the block and laid out a moat to develop shipping.
Then, the soil from the moat and Mt. Kanda were cut down to reclaim the cove.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7, Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of "Ginza Birthplace" that shows the site of the Ginza government office, so why not look for the direction you are interested in?
"Sacred place pilgrimage" in Ginza known to those in the know
In Ginza, a "sacred place pilgrimage" known to those in the know called "Ginza Haccho Shrine Tour" is held every year.
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most noticeable is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of Kabuki-za.
At the shrine on the far right of Kabuki-za, many people visit before and after the theater.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudouson" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shuseijizoson" is on the Ginza terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not noticeable, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" was revered by Kabuki famous actor Ichimura Hazaemon. The well-known "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the 1st floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
There are places where Fudo Myo and Jizo Bodhisattva are enshrined in this shrine tour, but most of the shrines use Inari as a deity.
"Inari Shrine", which is greeted by foxes in front of the shrine, was built extensively because it has the benefit of "five grain abundance" where rice is well fertilized in places where there are many farmers.
In turn, it has come to be said that there are benefits of prosperous business in big cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and the faith has spread even in Ginza, Japan's premier downtown area.

POSCO INTERNATIONAL acquires Australia's Senex Energy and expands overseas gas field business = Korea Press (WoW! Korea) --Yahoo! News
POSCO INTERNATIONAL announced on December 12 that it has signed a share acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year, with procedures such as approval at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and approval of the local subsidiary remaining.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO INTERNATIONAL has decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy will invest 49.9%.
POSCO INTERNATIONAL explained that it decided to acquire this acquisition because the demand for natural gas continued to increase even during the energy transition era, and the natural gas-based blue hydrogen, along with green hydrogen, would divide the market in the hydrogen market.
With this acquisition, POSCO INTERNATIONAL will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, or 44% of South Korea's 2019 natural gas consumption, as well as local gas field operations personnel in Australia.

That knee pain, maybe "gonarthrosis" !?
Treatment depending on the cause (Medical DOC) --Yahoo! News
Editorial department: Recently, I have been suffering from knee pain.
What kind of illness is possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "gonarthrosis" is the most common among Japanese people.
Editorial department: Does that mean that the joints are deformed?
Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for cushioning the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, cartilage may be worn or distorted due to aging, obesity, and intense sports.
The result is joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial department: Does osteoarthritis develop in other than the knee?
Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knees, it can occur at the joints and bases of the fingers, neck, hips, big toes, and hip joints.
However, the most common case is in the knee, which is called "gonarthrosis".
Editorial department: What kind of structure does a joint have in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: The joint has two bones that are unevenly combined.
The part where these two face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped with "joint capsule".
Editorial department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Maruyama: That's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule has a tissue called the synovium, which makes synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movement.
Editorial department: What symptoms do you get when you have osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
So to speak, it plays a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn or distorted, it can deform and inflame the joints, causing pain.

3 gambling & games in the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) --Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series, which is explosively popular with men.
One of the real thrills of this game is the ultimate life-threatening game.
[Photo] My legs shrug just by looking at it ... ... Challenge to cross the steel frame!
So, this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's game that can be actually played or is practiced in the planning video.
■ Swamp It is a pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Kaiji Gaming Hakkairoku".
In the original, Kaiji was astonished at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "swamp" was set up with large traps of "Nail Forest," "Movable Characters," and "Three-Stage Crune," making it almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of hands, and at the end he went out to the rough work of placing a vinyl water tank in the building and sinking the ground and tilting it, and successfully captured it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball" and the difficulty level is lowered, but you can feel the feeling of Kaiji.
■ Steel-frame migration At the "Starside Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, debtors including Kaiji were asked to carry out the steel-frame migration of "human horse racing."
The debtor competes for speed by trying not to fall on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people will participate and the top two will be able to win prize money, but there are only four steel frames, safety measures are inadequate, and the chances of dying are quite high.
This steel crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience a very close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", the home of professional baseball and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This eagle bridge has a steel-framed single bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and "Sky Blanco" and "Victory single bridge" are prepared ahead of it, so you can walk.
Of course, safety measures have been taken.
Koara Koarashi, a laughing entertainer, released a video of walking on the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube, saying that "steel crossing can be experienced in Japan" and became a hot topic.
■ E-card A two-player card game, "E-card".
Use 1 emperor's card, 8 citizen's cards, and 1 slave's card for a total of 10 cards, and play separately for the emperor's side and the slave's side.
The game is very well done, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
Kaiji will play against Tonegawa in the play with the strict rule that "If you lose, you can cut your ears."
After all, Kaiji realized that his ears were being read by detecting and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, such as earphones attached to his ears. He confused Tonegawa and won by making the scraped body an abnormal value.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and elsewhere.
On YouTube, the popular YouTuber Hikaru has uploaded a video of a game with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the film, with an E-card, which attracted a lot of attention.
■ Do you want to feel like Kaiji?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it's true that when you read a manga, you just feel like it.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A step toward the New Year, a gentle boost to the prefectural Gokoku Shrine Tora's large votive tablet | Yamagata Shimbun
At the prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive tablet of the zodiac sign "Tora" has appeared next year.
Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed the shrine visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication festival was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been requesting votive tablets from art college students since two years ago.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), who was in the third year, was selected from among the nine paintings of the Japanese painting course in the art department under the guidance of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large votive tablet is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.
Mr. Tsuchiya said that he drew it with "an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing the back to step into the new year."
The appearance of the tiger, which stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms, included a wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, we should have some time to enjoy the beauty of nature."
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also drawn on the votive tablets that are generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gonnegi said, "I think it will help all people to overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano who wants to continue living" To the proposal City 4 high school student workshop: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San Digi
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are jointly working on a workshop to think about "Tamano who wants to continue living."
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center", we will summarize the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayors.
"When is it fun?"
Students answer the facilitator's questions, such as "when they get excited with many people" and "when they hit the drums."
The first time held at Hinodefureai Hall on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people thought about "interesting towns," "easy-to-live towns," and "towns that make people feel worth living" using the "world cafe" method of discussing while moving through "islands" with their own themes.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and paste it on imitation paper to organize it.
"A town with many young people looks interesting." "Transportation such as trains and buses is indispensable for livability."
We will discuss further whether there is anything in common.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but it's attractive to be able to cycle along the beach," said a third-year student at Tamano Commercial and Technical High School (18).
A third-year student at Binan High School (18) said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but the place with abundant nature is good."
The second meeting in December was held only by high school students to organize the contents of the recommendations.
The mayor and the superintendent of education will be invited to make a presentation in February next year.
Rie Higashi, the director of the center, said, "I hope it will foster high school students' love for their hometown and encourage young people to take an active part in community development."

How to find a new way to wind a stall (Sankei Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
It's an indispensable stall in winter, but isn't the cloth tight around your neck?
It's a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding, but sometimes I hear people say that they don't know the trick.
I thought that the cloth wasn't stiff and there was a stall that could be rolled up quickly, so I found something new.
The stall of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is more compact than general ones.
When I first saw it, "Can I wind it so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that the cloth is cut into strips and knitted into a single piece, and the whole is a mesh.
The edge of the stall can be passed through the mesh.
Therefore, it can be rolled up and fastened without tying the ends together.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
Sleeveless gilet (vest) is popular this year, but many people will wear it in combination with a stole to keep their shoulders cool.
I think it would be convenient to have such a stall.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's a guy called Get Buck directed by Peter Jackson.
It's raw, it's like life-sized Beatles, and it's fresh ...
I'm doing Gisugis because it's just before the dissolution, but it's not the dramatic Gisugis I imagined.
While trying my best to partition, I'm late, even though I calmly say opinions and jokes, such as annoying Paul like "I know I'm ugly, but come on!" John, who is not motivated, and the apple, who plays the role of calm, do not actively squeeze, and sit behind him with a face saying "I'm in trouble"
I don't hate each other so much that they quarrel with each other, but there is a feeling that there is a lot of feeling in the air that "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and the Beatles were like that. Is an interesting dismantling of a legend
And when we started playing in such an atmosphere, everyone was really talented.
The process of finishing "that masterpiece" while each other is asking "How about this?" From a little phrase is dangerous.
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing
It's amazing that the scene where the casual humming humming humming gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics are entered is firmly recorded
It's hard to see the composition process like this.
It's natural, but everyone is crazy about it, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems that it is still one of the three episodes, but so far I got the impression that the biggest cause of the dissolution was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles itself.
The four of us are complaining about it, but when we start writing songs, it seems like it's going to be fun, but what about the live location? When it comes to talking about it, it was easy to understand that producers and propagandists were saying that the Beatles were the best in the world!
Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way ...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising, so I thought it might be the reason why Paul has many scenes that look like bad guys.

Tornadoes occur frequently in the United States and cause great damage The effects of unseasonable warmth and strong chills (Weathernews) --Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) of local time, tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern part of the United States.
Atmospheric conditions became extremely unstable due to the effect of strong cold air moving south to the record warmth during this period, and cumulonimbus clouds are thought to have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday 9th and Friday 10th local time has risen to nearly 30 ° C.
In the place where it was such a record warmth, a strong cold air of -30 ° C or less moved southward near 5500 m above the sky, so a lively front was formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It seems that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is originally a region where tornadoes are likely to occur, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The number of tornado warnings announced on the 1st in winter reached nearly 150 times, which was a record high.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusts on Friday, 10th local time alone.
According to this, we can see that there are two main areas, the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (enhanced Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached EF3, which is the third strongest of the six stages, and it is believed that a gust of around 70 m / s blew momentarily.
Depending on future investigations, it may be judged as EF4-5.
In Japan, based on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, JEF (Japanese Enhanced Fujita Scale) is used according to the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the American tornado this time, has a good chance of occurring in Japan as well, and it is a level at which a wooden house collapses.

Regarding the damage caused by tornadoes in the midwestern and southern parts of the United States, US President Biden expressed a mysterious view on the 11th (12th Japan time) as "one of the largest tornadoes in US history."
The US CNN TV and others reported.
"We will do everything as a federal government," Biden emphasized.
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost," he explained.
The death toll has risen to more than 100.
[Photo] Residents carrying household goods from broken houses in Kentucky, which was damaged by tornadoes From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states such as Kentucky.
As for the damage range of the tornado, there is a record of 219 miles (about 350 km) that caused damage to Missouri etc. in 1925, but this time CNN's meteorological expert said that it was about 250 miles (about 400 km). It was also estimated that it was the largest scale.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was heavily damaged, the candle factory, which was in operation 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas sales season, was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and there were no traces.
In the dark, a woman who could no longer move under a thick debris of about 1.5 meters felt the weight of a rescuer searching on the debris and asked for help on Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also echoed screams and the singing voice of "Happy Birthday to You," which appears to have been sung by another woman crying to dispel fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, was safe after hiding in the basement of his five-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people liken it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrifying sound like the sound of the earth gushing out," he recalled.
A police officer at the Mayfield Police Department said, "The search activity will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will be," he continued his hard rescue efforts.
In Illinois, a warehouse at Amazon, a major online shopping company, has collapsed, killing at least six people.
The trains are derailed due to the impact of being cut off, and the expressways are being blocked one after another due to the effects of vehicle falls.
According to US web media, a total of about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are out of power.

Avoid coarse-grained raw vegetables.

It is a long-standing discourse that the way of thinking about the star system evaluation system is different.
It is claimed that while foreign countries will deduct points from 5 stars as a standard, Japan will add / deduct points with 3 stars as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars have completely different meanings as "there is a deduction factor" and "not a masterpiece but a fine work".
If 5 stars are used as the standard, "works with no defects" and "works of the highest standard in all" will be in the same row, so if there is such a tendency, I think it would be a defect on the system that does not present the meaning of stars, but because such a system is actually operated in that way, you are asking me not to give it a three-star rating (notorious).
So if you try to argue with Steam's two-choice rating to those who insist on this kind of discourse, the story doesn't fit.

Is there a USB-powered submersible pump that can be plugged into a general hose size?
The capacity of the power supply that can be taken from USB is up to about 2A at 5V, so it's just 10W.
The submersible pump consumes at least 500W, depending on the product, so it's impossible.

I made an am radio with my own condenser and coil, but it was so noisy that I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio sound, but I heard a radio with a different frequency than the tuned frequency.
It's possible that the tuning was sweet and I couldn't hear it properly, but it wasn't what I expected.

<A note of eating> "Hakobune" "Seasonal fish fried and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce" | Living and culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento "Seasonal fish fried and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce caught in the sea"
"Hakobune" is a takeout specialty store that uses plenty of vegetables for colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes).
Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened in August last year, saying, "I want you to feel like a restaurant at home."
One of the popular lunch boxes is "Seasonal fish fried and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce caught in the sea" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best ones at the market at that time.
"Fried shrimp is made with raw bread crumbs as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients," says Takayuki.
There are about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli to accompany the lunch box, and rice and soup with millet are added to the Hinohikari rice from Saga prefecture.
Vegetables are purchased at home-made soba fields or direct sales offices in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki is training in French, and lape and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, it is a mix of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with a "relaxing taste that you are accustomed to eating" (Mr. Yumi) like a omelet roll.
The lunch box "Domestic Aibiki Meat Hand-made Hamburger Steak" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, we will also release a processed meat product "Charcuterie set" that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to visit Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I tried using it.
Ride quality Not so bad, but occasionally shakes (not enough to get drunk)
Speed Of course slow
Safety I think it's safe because it slows down when there are people around, and in some cases it stops completely, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
The eyes around me hurt and it's good to be seen, but I can see it as if it's in the way, it hurts my heart
Overall comment It's not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it will be easier to use if there are a few more people or if there is consideration such as getting closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create a dedicated lane so that it would not get in the way of others walking.
However, because I am relaxing, I can relax while watching the scenery, so I thought that it would be a good vehicle if there were a few more people.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a fairly patient heart, with the excitement of the near future feeling that such automatic driving will become mainstream in the future and the pain of the eyes around you.

If you look very closely, you may understand it a little, but I don't use any eel.
It's actually "! Eggplant!"! (Tap to get the correct answer)
I like eels, but in reality, everyone just eats them with sauce, and I thought that the eel part could be anything other than the degree of grilling ... I thought that the texture and volume of the eels were important.
I didn't want the eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat them.
Recipe used: EGGPLANT "UNAGI" - Woks of Life (sprinkled with Japanese pepper instead of green onions.

Around 1:25 am on the 12th, a man in his 40s in Fukuoka Prefecture was cut with a knife by a man in his 30s and 40s on the street of Otakara 1-chome, Saga City, and his face was injured.

The man who escaped is a medium-sized skinhead.
A knife that seems to have been used for the crime was left near the scene.
It is said that the man was drinking alcohol with an acquaintance, and he is investigating that there was some kind of traffic trouble between the pedestrian man and the motorcycle man.

A long family journey that has rooted environmental protection activities in the remote areas of China (JBpress) --Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Hong Kong Company Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, which has a vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, and the types of mammals that inhabit it are the largest in the world, and the types of plants are the third largest in the world.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only the environmental protection provided by local governments but also the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such region.
His younger sister, Lee, is currently active as an actress. Xishuangbanna is a region bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many minorities, including the "Tai" who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, are flowing.
Xishuangbanna Tai (Xishuangbanna) Autonomous Region Xishuangbanna covers only 0.2% of the total area of China, but is home to about 25% of wildlife species and 20% of plant species.
This time, we met Mr. Lee, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Xishuangbanna, and talked about the contents of the activities.
■ Started environmental protection activities with my German husband ――― I heard that it has been 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the reason for that?
Mr. Lee Our environmental protection activity "Ten" started in 2000.
The reason was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Xishuangbanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It was the only rainforest region in China and boasted one of the greatest biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was also lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of rainforests has previously taken place in order to establish industry in the region and to produce the rubber that was lacking in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and study biological resources.
Then I got acquainted with me who was a reporter here and got married.
― ― Wasn't Lee interested in nature conservation before that?
Mr. Lee I'm from Xishuangbanna, but I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though their faces are not neat and they are not particularly tall. Why do you think?

The aura is not something that you want to put out.
It's something that comes out naturally the moment you feel confident in yourself.
I'm sure that person has a solid self-confidence inside.

Suddenly, is it fine to say that the other person's clothes are homey or the color is good?
It's not detailed, right?
I can see it.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been praised for it, so I don't know what it means.
Is it a fine compliment?
What would you do if you confessed to Sakura Yokomine?
"My heart is in full bloom in spring after being confessed to Mr. Sakura, please do this," he replies and goes out with him.
And to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to open it?
The procedure will be completed sooner if you open it at the same time.
Now it will be completed in about a week.
Separately, there is no fee, so it is recommended to open a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

[Oma Tamaki / Personal note] MOD It has been the cause of CTD in your own environment, and it took about one and a half months to identify it.
Until March, CTD occurred due to multiple factors while stable data did not have much time to play from around GW, and it took a long time to identify it as if I examined it little by little only on holidays.
Why didn't you parse the logs with the .Net Script Framework (you'll know in a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and mesh are not recorded in the crash log.
〇Main CTD timing
* All papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and log-type .dll plug-ins logs do not leave a footprint.
* When some NPCs are killed / accumulated attacks: Activated even with console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / power of three SE update resumed version) Improved by OFF * Is there a possibility of wet clothing?
* During camera work when kill move is activated for some NPCs → Basic improvement by turning off kill move setting by PC by turning it off via .ini: DAR + Nemesis related setting conflict? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic outdoor) While moving in the field + Partial magic activated (example: freezing rune) and NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) All improved by 5 consecutive trials with all OFF.
Is it due to some additional armor worn by actors / NPCs or misconfiguration of the body mesh shader? In addition, the 2.0 SPID use default .ini has a format error, but the result should be the intended result and the prerequisite Perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the motion / combat mods (of .dll) related to site attacks and OnHit by putting on wet clothes, but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German and French levels.
In the unlikely event that someone has a similar CTD problem in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reminder, so I posted it.
Everyone is doing it with the last minute mentality,
The people around me don't notice it, not only my colleagues but also my family.
When I look around, I sometimes optimistically think that he is working well even though he seems to be having a hard time.
But maybe he's just barely mental.
I haven't retired in the name of mental health, but I think I was at the limit just before I retired.
Thinking about the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing - after today's home-visit nursing
I have been receiving home-visit nursing care for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, but I have had a long relationship with the nurse (female) at the home-visit nursing station I am currently using, and I have a very good relationship. I think I can build it.
I talk about various things every week.
Of course, it also does what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but above all, I thought that today's home-visit nursing care is about how important fun communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, I talked about gender differences between men and women, or even discussed gender theory.
Is it okay to do home-visit nursing about the libido of men and women, why she got divorced, and so on? I also talk about it.
Occasionally, I'm dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of the home-visit nursing station operated by the psychiatric hospital, an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward will come and only provide clerical work, or even though an occupational therapist is coming for home-visit nursing, "I've heard from an acquaintance that he gives instructions from above, such as "this is doing medical care."
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think it's a really good nurse who faces Frank on an equal footing with me who has a mental illness.
By the way, it's a beautiful girl lol.
Some people may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing care, and some may be thinking about receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, please take it.
And choose a good home-visit nursing station.
In the past, I couldn't get the warp right, so I canceled the contract from here.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth that of China ... "Delayed in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (Central Daily Japanese version) --Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be popularized (cumulative total), and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price is set at 6000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units).
The hydrogen station diffusion schedule for the core infrastructure is 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilogram is 8400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap was well below the target.
The Federation of Korean Industries (Federation of Korean Industries) released the report "Current Status of Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem and Policy Direction" on the 12th.
According to the report, the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry depend mostly on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, which is the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane membrane is supplied by DuPont (US), Gore (US), 3M (US), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six leading countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
South Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total for 2014-2020).
However, the Federation of Korean Industries said, "In fact, six countries occupy most of the world hydrogen market, and in fact, it means that it is the lowest among the competitors."
The order of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
The gap has widened since China overtook the United States to take first place in 2017.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1033 in South Korea, which was higher than Japan (974) and ranked fourth, but it is 22% of that in China (4721).
Zenkeiren proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a" national strategic technology "with a large tax credit for capital investment and R&D costs."

Congress on Sunday?
, TV program-style leaflet creation Takasu is in the process of parliamentary reform, and the "correspondence book" of members of the Diet is also: Hokkaido Shimbun electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique council reforms, such as creating a bizarre leaflet to guide the holding of regular meetings and introducing a "correspondence book" in which the townspeople evaluate the members.
The town council has not voted for three consecutive terms, with the aim of getting the townspeople interested.
About 1800 new leaflets were distributed in newspapers on the 9th to inform the Sunday Assembly held on the 12th.
"Raw Giron from the morning" "Tetsuko's room" "Sawaguchi Hitoshi exploration series" ....
The leaflets distributed by the town council on the 9th are reminiscent of popular TV program names.

US aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine Engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp) --Yahoo! News
(CNN) US Department of State officials reported that by the 12th, equipment, including firearms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security aid plan approved by President Biden.
The total amount of military aid is worth $ 60 million, and the last equipment, including four radars that identify the launch site, such as mortars, will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
These aids also included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin," according to US Department of Defense spokesman Kirby.
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's strengthening of troops around the border with Ukraine.
The United States has become more cautious about the movement of Russian troops, and is consulting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states to devise countermeasures in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden had approved weapons assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the US White House on September 1, this year.
US military aid to Ukraine reached about $ 450 million this year.
Since Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula, total aid has risen to more than $ 2.5 billion.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian army.
Last month, it dispatched National Guard of the United States of Florida in accordance with a multilateral joint training program supported by Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Command in Europe also plays a major role in the training and advice of the Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of US Special Forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a confidential matter in the execution of the operation.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges in the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The whereabouts of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes gifts "forbidden" during life, hits Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Speaking with your family during the New Year holidays!
It is "advancement and rush inheritance technique".
While discussions on the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax are underway, the 2022 tax reform outline, which was a concern, was put off, but in the near future, the royal road to inheritance tax measures, advancement, may become a "prohibition". Is large.
How will the inheritance rules change?
Along with a direct hit to the former Liberal Democratic Party chairman, Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to the tax-saving techniques that will be made in time for a great deal by the end of the year.
(Diamond editorial department Hiroaki Miyahara)
● Forbidden gifts that are used by property owners and office workers in urban areas "From the point of view of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more holistically, we will proceed with full-scale consideration toward the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the time of asset transfer."
A sentence from the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year spread a great deal of turmoil not only to wealthy people but also to the middle class.
Because, to put it simply, the inheritance tax will be greatly increased by completely changing the rules of inheritance and making "advancement", which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, a "prohibition".
The ironclad rule of inheritance tax saving measures with high progressiveness is to "reduce taxable property".
The strongest trump card, the advance gift, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by office workers who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to their homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
The discussion of "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" that arose in such a situation.
Although it was postponed in the 2010 tax reform outline announced on December 10, which was concerned about the fastest introduction, "Review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and calendar year gift system" "Gift tax exemption measures Since it is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount, we will constantly review it. " Was launched again.
Akira Amari, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax system investigation, said in an interview with the editorial department.
"It is most important to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the time of property transfer and to keep the tax burden the same whenever you go.
Currently, we are simulating what problems will arise (due to integration). "With the fastest amendment, there are only three chances left for the advancement.
Even if that is not the case, it seems certain that in the near future, there will be a major shift toward invalidating advance gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So how do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

[NFL] What and how did the team players who won three passes in one game feel (BBM Sports) --Yahoo! News
The Patriots passed only three times in this match, which Jones threw.
This is the lowest number of NFLs in the last 50 years since Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
Bills in 1974 had an unprecedented genius RB named O.J. Simpson who exceeded 2000 yards for the first time in history last season.
Bills overwhelmed Jets with Simpson and another run by RB Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason for the Patriots to deploy such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on that day, the temperature was about 1 degree Celsius, the wind was rough at a wind speed of 18 m, and it was snowing before the game.
Bills was only local and didn't change his play choices much.
25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it wasn't bad at all.
There was a scoring machine with four red zone invasions in the 10 offense series.
Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, he advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three times, I could only score three points in one FG.
Defense in front of the goal in the final stage of the game.
Bills, who chased 4 points, took a penalty in 3rd & 9 and became 3rd & 14.
18 yards to the goal.
At 3rd & 14, QB Allen emerged from his pocket and flowed to the right, surrounded by the Patriots defense rush.
He threw a pass at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone but failed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran Sharo-Across and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen did not see it.
On the 4th & 18, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the outside, but the pass was unsuccessful when hit by the Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in the foreground.
Bryant had a one-on-one cover of Bills' WR Cole Beasley, but on the way he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw a pass at the end zone both times.
The 4th down pass may have been a decisive move, but the 3rd down didn't have to aim for the TD.
You only have to take the first down in two plays.
It was still 2 minutes before, so if I made it 4th & short, Allen's ability with his own run should have lived.

It's about time to "discard" & "replace", 3 items that tend to be left in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) --Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably the sponge that you don't change as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (still recommended to sterilize in the microwave).
German researchers who did this study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that the chopping board should be replaced if it begins to fray and has scratches or grooves.
Once the scratches and ditches have progressed, it becomes difficult to keep them clean and bacteria can grow.
If it's still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect it with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach in 1 gallon of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in liquid and leave for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and let it dry naturally or tap with a clean paper towel to drain and dry.
Chipped or broken tableware
Disposing of your favorite mug may be painful, but the chipped surface provides a new breeding ground for bacteria and bacteria.
It can also cut your lips and spill your drink at the missing parts.
Yes, it's a chance to buy a new and favorite mug!

Help Flash BIOS never end
I bought the Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced it with the B550 I bought in September and a tomaho.
I went to the BIOS setting screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the point that seems to be a white cursor on the black screen did not blink and it was in a state of being accepted all the time.
I thought the BIOS was corrupted and tried to rewrite it using Flash BIOS, but it didn't end at all.
According to the MSI blog, it takes about 5 minutes, but it doesn't end in 1 hour.
The probable cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the SD card is converted and used.
Is the tomaho crazy because I slept too much?
Is there any other cause like that?
Do you always hate a man with a straight face?
a! I was acquainted.

It's embarrassing to have a branded product for some reason.
If it's inconspicuous, I can have it, but I can't have it like Vuitton, which is written as Lv in monogram.
Why?
I think it's best to fit your length.
By the way, I think it's good in Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
You should say it early, "Why am I just abandoning / tame mouth?"
So it doesn't matter because it's a foreigner? It's better to simply say that it's unpleasant.
Maybe I don't even dream that I'm uncomfortable with a good chance
I used to live abroad on the way, but the Japanese who went outside, including me, didn't like the Confucian traditions of the top and bottom. I've misunderstood it.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you're doing it with a kind of sweetness or a friendly feeling without being purely offensive.
If my friend is also a Westerner, I would call him by the name below, but sometimes when I speak in Japanese, I get a little confused about which one to use.
Well, if you're a friend, it's still good.
Originally, I think I'm just doing it normally, but if I overlook it, it may not be possible to stop the exceptional treatment of being a Gaijin, so I should say it now.
Because it's Japan, can you talk with Japanese rules?
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my white friend who is naturalized always raises the glass higher than other younger ones when toasting at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do that, you won't be fooled by younger or older people, or you will be treated like a Japanese person.
Because Japanese people (including me) are fucking people who look at such details regardless of their personality

I have only a little ability to understand English, so I will judge only by the translated text.
The translated text feels a little strange to the text, but I understand what I want to convey and I think it's a level that doesn't hurt to play (just because I feel this way, I think you should also ask others)
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that if it is a small company, it is well translated.
I think that people who are not native Japanese understand the differences in the subtle nuances of Japanese if they can reach it even after studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, you should look for someone else.

Consideration "Kimetsu no Yaiba" training is the battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human hymn <Commemorating the start of the anime "Yukaku Hen"> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) --Yahoo! News
Among the recent boy manga, "Kimetsu no Yaiba" is particularly different in that "there is a lot of training."
It is a well-established theory that the training edition, which generally has no battle and trains at dawn or after dark, is not popular with readers.
It should be known from the fact that even in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", there was training for two years when the Straw Hats were separated, but only the touch was drawn and the rest was daringly skipped.
Well, one of the attractions of dresses is the eccentricity of the land they travel around, and "staying in the same place for training" may not be so compatible.
By the way, the training of the main character of "Kimetsu no Yaiba", Kanjiro, took a seat on Yoshiyuki Tomioka, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Tanjiro Tanjiro, who tried to take his own life. It can be said that it started when Yoshiyuki said, "Don't let others hold the right to deprive him of his life!"
The weak have no rights or choices, they can only be subdued by the strong ....
While saying that, the kindness of Yoshiyuki (also a poor communicator who does not explain the intention) was introduced by Sakonji Rakutaki, a "nurturer" who trains applicants to join the demon slaughter corps.
The first contact between Kanjiro and Rakutaki was asked, "What would you do when your sister ate a person?"
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of narrative grass among fans.
However, carrying a younger sister who became a demon has the possibility that such a judgment may come.
It can be said that it is an initiation to start training from the mindset.
However, Rakutaki takes an amateur, Kanjiro, who hasn't trained yet, to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are thin and full of pits, catapults, and traps, so you'll die before you start training.
Even so, it is barely a "hero correction" to sniff out the faint scent of traps set by human hands with a sharp sense of smell and somehow avoid it.
Even so, it is the essence of demonizing demons that makes Kanjiro say, "That's why my physical ability doesn't suddenly increase so suddenly that I can avoid it all of a sudden!!"
Ordinary humans do not suddenly become stronger without any support, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills they have refined up to that point" with their original potential.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human hymn different from a demon who has unfounded paranormal power, and rewards those who have made an effort, and does not reward anything that has not been made. It is a consistent and hard-to-move rule.
Is this old?
It's not a bed yet, but a mat is laid directly on the house, and you sleep on a rug or comforter.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you use the room widely, it is better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Are you clinging?
If you work as a part-time worker and want to work full-time, do you have a hard time working with other stores?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, it doesn't correspond to what I think of.
Somehow, I think that it is "hard" to plan to get more profit than labor with the minimum effort.
Do you have any non-smoking outpatient clinics nationwide now?
I do it everywhere.

Samsung Electronics Korea establishes "DX Division" that integrates home appliances and mobile, "emphasizes user experience" (WoW! Korea) --Yahoo! News
Following the integration of CE and IM divisions as a set division by Samsung Electronics, the name was decided to be DX (Device eXperience), and it was announced on the 12th that this will be reflected in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through various services from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics announced that the DX division, which was newly established by integrating the CE and IM divisions, will consist of divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
An official at Samsung Electronics explained, "This name change reflects the medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership."
It also emphasizes the intention to make consumers feel free to enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect customer needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, the strategy of creating synergies on a company-wide scale and building a differentiated product and service base across organizational boundaries was also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics has already been through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), and is planning a strategy to make it possible to use content and services freely.

There is a matter of taste, but I don't think "desu/masu style" is suitable for a natural science documentary in which a low-voiced man acts as a narrator.

> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armored heads visible from the sand ... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> Hanmyo larvae ambush in the sand to catch their prey at any time, revealing only the disc-shaped head from the sand.
This is a little unnatural.
Hanmyo larvae ambush in the sand so that their prey can be caught at any time, and only the disc-shaped head can be seen through the sand.
I think it should be.
What worries me
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking from an ant's point of view?
Is it?
If you translate armored heads into disc-shaped heads, I think that the part that says "It's a giant beast wearing a helmet on the scale of ants" disappears ...
Aichi 24 Collision Trailer Driver No Chronic Illness Careless (TV Asahi (ANN)) --Yahoo! News
In the accident where 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent was not ill and it seems that he had caused the accident due to some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway No. 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, 54, who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of injuring a 71-year-old man in the first rear-end collision, and sent him to the police on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to move without braking after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura was temporarily unconscious immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura had no chronic illness and was found to be due to some carelessness.
The police are searching the house of the person concerned and investigating the situation at that time in detail.

Kinnikuman Review of Oginuma X [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) --Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started in Volume 3, is completed in Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicts everything from the opening to the semi-finals at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focuses on only one race!
● "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are a carefully drawn book about the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it's a volume that never depicts the match on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, it's hard to go to the match, such as mutual tug-of-war battles and special training scenes, but it's never boring.
This feeling in the work, in which the tension that the battle of the century is about to begin, is definitely connected to the increase in the reader's tension, and I am impressed that even this period is a really calculated production.
And before the important final, another mountain, the 3rd place decision between Terryman and Ramenman cannot be overlooked.
In addition to the luxury as a battle card, what I like is behind the scenes before the match, when Ramenman points to the Kinnikuman poster, "It's my turn to aim!"
And try to hit the chop.
However, the scene where Terryman who happened to pass by takes the knife and blocks it, glares silently, and the place just breaks up.
What's great about this is that both have already been eliminated and I no longer have the opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
However, there is such a rush over the Kinnikuman.
If you can see this, you can't help but think about your success in the distant future!
This is what it means for a character to stand up, and I'm still keenly aware of it as a manga artist!
The battle between the two ends without breaking the scale, but the famous scene is the appeal of Ramenman's tears after the match.
To Kinnikuman, "Don't rely solely on the strength of your luck!"
It's a line called.
Is this a magnificent meta-remark about the work itself? I think readers have felt that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character, and that he has somehow won in a place where he is not capable.
However, by having Ramenman make this remark, Yudetamago-sensei stabbed the nail that he could no longer use his hand.
In one word, the reader asked, "Well then, does Kinnikuman really beat Robin?
how? "
You can imagine the invisible development again, and from another writer's point of view, this is the same line as Yudetamago-sensei, who makes the work, imposes a bond on himself.
This was a great thing.
I think it's definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illuminations Weekend Held Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) --Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is surrounded by gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illuminations that began on November 26 are studded with 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20-meter-high Kusunoki, along walking paths and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time and was surprised that there was such a place.
It was so beautiful and I was relieved. "
The illuminations were planned for the first time to avoid crowds and give a feeling of healing, and are lit from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
Also, on the 25th of the last day, as a Christmas event, the behavior of the button pot and the film screening will be held.
I think there are only a few people who can read through the documents in order.
When I asked him if he had a friend who could read it very much, well, he was a person who could do it, but he was hardening from the basics of Linux, and I read the table of contents in a reference book rather than a document and read from the place I was interested in.
(Actually, it is easier to apply and understand if you learn from Linux rather than suddenly touching something with a high degree of abstraction such as docker.
It's hard to pull it out and suddenly understand everything.
I hope you understand ...
) You don't have to do it in order.
Also, I don't remember the contents, but somehow I remember the part that I skipped in advance and read it when necessary.
I didn't read anything and suddenly broke it in practice and then read it repeatedly, so I started to read it gradually.

Online distribution, agricultural and livestock product PR Oki Agricultural Promotion Association, relay from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Oki Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities and JAs in the Oki area, developed a PR activity for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce", which sells products while distributing videos on the Internet.

The power of the NAS PC no longer turns on🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~ What happened ~
1.) Open the window for ventilation in the morning.
At this time, the PC is energized.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed that the PC made a sound like a pink rotor and shut down for the first time.
At this point, I thought that the fan was just not moving well due to the drop in room temperature (6 ° C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Does not start.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is switched on for a moment and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say yes or no.
I unplug the power plug and try again, but it only works for a moment.
4.) I connected only the ATX 20 pin and 4 pin to the motherboard, removed the other parts and tried it, but it did not start.
5.) I suspect that PSU is the cause because it seems that PSU fans are hitting something and there is a buzzing noise.
I will find a surplus ATX power supply at a later date and try it.
maybe.
If it doesn't work ... what should I do?
Do you want to change the case and mother together ...
Have you seen wild rabbits recently (within the last 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Are you surrounded by nature?
I live in Tohoku.
I'm everywhere near us.
There are also gardens and company parking lots.

The 1st, 3rd, and 5th place laughing emojis are very easy to use, aren't they?
Of course, when it's interesting and happy, I've done it!

On the other hand, those who have never used the top 10 emojis are rare among rares.
I want you to stick to that style.
