In Kherson, people again came to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, Kherson residents managed to hold a rally before the Russian military with equipment arrived at the scene to disperse.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now Russian equipment has arrived there, " said one of the participants of the event.
Earlier, citizens traditionally gathered for protest actions on Freedom Square - near the building of the regional state administration and the Regional Council.
This square, like the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against rally participants and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of the Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson a special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, it will stop beating – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the armed forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
Direct speech: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights – we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ED.) are people who pulled a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in (the area) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these areas, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that may lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it, too.
Then our negotiating situation will be weaker and may not even be interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we State.
We believe in our result, in our victory."
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose opportunities for a diplomatic solution, if we have them."
Direct speech: "people will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but кожна every family has lost something – and I don't think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we don't speak emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there are no people."

Due to the change in the estesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who took part in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kiev region.
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine reports this on Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Main Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine has received a list of servicemen of the 64th separate Motorized Rifle Brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," the report says.
The Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense notes that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list here.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpen, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kiev region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military were recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, Bucha mayor Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor general Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of dead civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the launch of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive attacks on residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and aerial bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news about the brutal bullying of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century.! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was looking forward to is happening...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that he returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the armed forces of Ukraine and never for a moment doubted that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family would not be spared.
Because I was and still am absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without Terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was allowed to make a copy of the execution case of my great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages long, but the sentence to death is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate and denied any wrongdoing.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was one of the free people, poor "one-yard" Gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the Plowman and feeder of young children to death.
Relatives didn't even find out about the burial site.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give perjury.
In the criminal case, there is a name of the snitch Shariy.
Our former Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I wouldn't be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An Apple is not far from an apple tree, as you know, Falls...
The firing troika that condemned the peasants to execution were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of my great-grandfather, I became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as "Immortal barrack", which qualitatively remind about the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, The Descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers – the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
It seems that files with child pornography were found on the computer, they were put in prison for it, and there he quickly died.
KGB officers are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and Imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were superimposed on top of the thousand-year horde tradition.
And then they did a brutal genetic experiment on what came out, killing the intelligentsia during several waves of Red Terror.
Watch the semi-French film "the Chekist" from 1992, and so it was.
Zo have you seen my photos in a swimsuit
You can ask your wife what I can buy for coughing .

The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I do not know about Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly for selfish, Mercantile purposes.
And I have a problem with this, if I don't love a person, nothing will work out.
Yes, we took it home and took it to my aunt right away.
She was very grateful, she was already crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.

But this is not necessary . Only if it does. I'm very grateful to you, too .
I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions to God, why there are situations in my life that just made me despair of everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.

This is true but we do not yet navigate the area and do not know where everything is located.We searched for the supermarket for an hour today and walked back.Two blankets are not suitable,so two are needed in a large size
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote to me.

According to" European truth", This is reported by Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Howitzers are also offered in the version on the boxer armored personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to get relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the delivery of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled in by industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the contract is signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full deliveries will not be completed until 2027.
Is it us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you we will find how to top up ryakhonoe and naberkmo. I'll unsubscribe. Thank you
I go to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and poiim when my doctor recovers I will pass the commission right I understand?
How can I now change my T-Mobile tariff package to 4 gigabytes for 249 CZK?
Hello, I'm sorry. I want to ask you if you need a worker?
Can wash floors or dishes.
Unfortunately, I don't know the language from Ukraine, but I need a job.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.

Thank you because something is not working out very well here
And even we already have a craft from the nursery
I'm sorry, so I got something wrong.
I didn't understand Czech so well then.
I must have come up with something for myself.
That's right they go to school like three because Galya and Svyatoslav study remotely finish school in Ukraine and will receive graduation certificates in the fall they need to enter universities
Can you tell me how to get to the city center?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is a sacrament of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman decide their own issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are close.
Why not try it this way for now
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

I was upset that Kolya and I didn't translate the test well yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them in some way?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to improve my mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that there are no errors.
Thank you for your test tasks
We hope so too
And so she is very happy with any gift
I just wanted to connect the internet to my Czech number
Yesterday, at bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall 29 is designed specifically for submitting and processing applications for assistance

So that she doesn't get scared that no one has come
I didn't go. Yes, I baked it myself.  I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So how long are you leaving town?
Six months ago, at the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and live in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the foundation that we must protect – it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, " then for us Germans, there can only be one answer: Never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the residents of the cities it has blocked and allowed them to die of diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
So, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was impossible to imagine not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But " never again!"it doesn't just mean speaking out against the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine without risks and victims.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be assembled

Call me for late documents.

Sergey Sidorenko: our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the revolution of dignity, the flight of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of a full – scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens-more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides during the war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its members-countries – for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, and the unwillingness to "annoy" Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if this can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed questions", together with the editor of "European truth", we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why security guarantees discussed at negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a Volt partner indicated that my application is under consideration.

Yes, I had a bad heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and asked me to forgive him.
I turned him down.
Then, some time later, he called that he had had heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During this time, we talked a lot.
I then started having problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe I really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does ready for marriage mean to you?
And he only speaks Czech

I can't remember this scenario in any way )
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev :they say "we haven't done this before"
Konashenkov's direct speech: "we see attempts of sabotage and strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will launch strikes on decision-making centers, including in Kiev, which the Russian army previously refrained from."
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian occupation forces.
On February 25, The Remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a TV tower on Dorogozhichi near Babi Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles over the Southern Railway Station, flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, the wreckage of a downed missile of the invaders smashed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenevka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who evacuated from the city to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of Mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell"allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are sweating profusely at the very thought that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of crowds of thousands in the squares of Europe's largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this elegant fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against speeding up Ukraine's entry, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered scammers.
It is better to give the funds that you collect to people who are more in need.

Are you all right with your imagination ??
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, take a vacation.
You have a dream.
You are planning to buy this dress that you saw yesterday in the shopping center.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't accept it.
He chips for the old reality.
You call at work to find out whether to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... it's not for long.
Now .... they'll agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to perceive...
Where to go ?? I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I have$ 50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many of our managers were not given wages at our jobs.
Where should I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for my children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything from the House... you have to go 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you'll have something to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to night, you drag your children all over Prague.
What's next ? Unknown. How much is it ? Not known. Children ask for sweets. You can't . It's expensive for you.
And with every iron-we do not have such a thing.
We have a choice - to stay there and bring the children into danger, or try to escape here

These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are public utilities that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first-aid kits for the front.

In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa application center and the on-line queue does not work.

So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.

Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is this?
The head of the presidential office, Andrei Ermak, said that Russia is launching a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies hand over to us.
Yermak's direct speech: "they understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to" bring down " the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the alleged destruction of S - 300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I'll name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrender with weapons from their allies, and they are massively switching to the Russian army.
I want to immediately prevent such fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of soldiers of the armed forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the next World.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a "provocation".
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they did," she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports surfaced that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the Kiev suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly show the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a "genocide" in Bucha.
"We will do everything possible to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the charges as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another setting of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city before March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, The Investigative Committee of Russia issued a statement in which it announced an "investigation" on charges of spreading "deliberately false information" by Ukraine about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3 accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures.for shots in the back of the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Liberty saw bodies of allegedly civilians on the streets of a small town.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in civilian clothes – were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kiev." How the invaders viciously exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list, there is another item about which there is now much less information – the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
Since about mid-March, the Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military training ground.
Ukrayinska Pravda found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the very "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary and forced evacuation from Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Iosif Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military camp, although it was civilian.
Like true plastuns, Denis and Marina packed disturbing suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They didn't have their own car, and commuter buses didn't take anyone anymore.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, when the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke both non-Russian and non-Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: "Is there anyone?"I say yes. – Get out!".
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned about whether they had served in the army.
The women were told:"we have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the troops, young guys of 25-35 years old.
They said: "here we were helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasha bely (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement una-Unso" Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen War – up), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the same, the Russians will take them" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the internet where children Thank Kadyrov for the food.
So they brought sausages after looting the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a nice cut.
Our child says, " you have 7 days to give away our phones," they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want war, they support the Ukrainians and are generally good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov is also there, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob stores, looted.
They brought chickens for themselves, tied a St. George ribbon to one leg, and their white tape to the other, and called it "opolchenka".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
When they were beaten up in Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: "do you have artillery?"
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other among themselves, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing force.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses – our people constantly got into it from "Bayraktar".
But these people came and told us that the armed forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" is so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kiev has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian citizen came to us – either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB-and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – it was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe they gave us a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "you are being taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "then feel sorry for the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house-either with grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some of them did not go, saying that this was for traitors to the motherland – they say, "they will shoot you there, sell you for organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, equipment was broken, although Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed improvised control, many of them were without documents at all, because they were burned down.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And then we hear gunshots! A rocket fires, and you can see the trail – it was an Iskander working in Kiev.
Although these people from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we are from aviation, have an education, and understand what this is.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the Sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
Its head, Vasily Stepanovich Venger, came and said: "Here, I am a Ukrainian, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these enemies of yours are reached.
Poor people are suffering!
And we have such a good Lukashenka!
As he says, so he will."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "Yes, you are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men should not go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents – my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us in any way, and in Minsk, at the railway station, they said that no one would take anyone on the bus without passports.
Here I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
They didn't hold me by force in the sanatorium.
The migration representative told our second group that you can stay here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier that volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – up), we saw ballistic missile launches on Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who boarded the bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say:"you are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their training grounds are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting in Poland and took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering and deciding what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia now as there are Estonian ones."
Marina lived on the territory of a military camp in Gostomel with her brother's family – his wife and two children, aged 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to – the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.

On April 1, Bucha mayor Anatoly Fedoruk announced the good news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed right on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of the dead were minors.
Olga Sukhenko, the headman of the village of Motyzhin, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were abducted on March 23, were found dead and with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, Igor – in the sewer.
Along the highway 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go no one will be home

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the president's Office, writes "European truth".
"All the equipment, everything that they already send, for some types of equipment it was done late.
Therefore, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, and this is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different look.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would still be no war," he added.
Recall that the British prime minister promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

I just got a call from a woman from Dameidlo and said that they were sending me information about further actions by email and I never gave an answer.
She spoke Czech, and that's how I understood her.
But I don't have an email from dameidlo in my email

He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my own point of view on life.I met him, then left him.
He was a very rich man, and after a while he called and said that he had had heart surgery.
He just asked me to talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he proposed to me
"There was a car in my yard, like a crocodile, and let out hail.
And they kept me in the house, then took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.

"I tell her that the "repair of the TV and radio" was delayed due to imported parts, and my friends and acquaintances were warned not to say too much when they call."
"We have been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it has succeeded.
However, the spot (cat – up) on the belly and hind legs has peeled fur – this may be due to stress, food changes and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Spot, unlike his mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito"for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polevaya took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
Both the war and the fact that I was around were hidden from her – formally, as always, I came for a few hours.
But when her friend let it slip, I gave her the radio – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours."
The radio was always near the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She didn't hear well, which allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her" walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but the war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
Exactly on April 17 - I have cleaning of 2 apartments:)
Good evening, I didn't even think about it :)
Hi, if you need more of our help tomorrow, we can come

I'm telling you the embassies are only here,
Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a member of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page of Erwin Aislinn, a British man who served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, the Air Force with reference to members of Aislinn's family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Aislinn who spoke with him
Literally, Aislinn's twitter: "we received news from him:' 48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon."
Details: Aislinn served in the 36th separate marine brigade of the armed forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the Defense operation of Mariupol.
BBC reporters contacted the soldier's mother, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had said by phone that they planned to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that Aislinn said in a recent phone conversation about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the Brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Aislinn's unit intends to surrender to Russian units, so as not to fall into the hands of the so-called "kadyrovites"without weapons and bullets.
Also in social networks, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed, in which Aislinn allegedly talks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislinn said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they did not succeed.
Earlier, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislinn was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to participate in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the armed forces of Ukraine and took the oath of office.
Aislinn's friends and family called him Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The attacking Bolsheviks recouped their losses in battle to the fullest.
The teacher Dmitry Pavlitsky, his unknown relative, a young man Boris Alekseenko, was shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep garbage pit, which was covered with Earth."
According to his memoirs, "there was a kind of dead silence in the city."
Occasionally, one of the residents ran from house to house.
The bodies of those tortured by the Bolsheviks were constantly found on the streets

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When can I bring you things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On monitoring potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the economic sphere turned out to be... the place where members of the Supervisory Board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the Supervisory Board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know about any company that has a need to physically hold meetings of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear – this is an excellent basis for "demolishing" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the revolution of dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies need supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then others may take off tomorrow – for example, you can demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the start of the war and Bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the company's work may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can it be prevented by moving members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal safety above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
But it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
So, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (mic), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna via Zoom."
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned defense industry enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board exists only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the law, the Supervisory Board has rather limited powers, and all its members do not perform their duties free of charge.
All power in Ukroboronprom belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will make decisions on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, this argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned defense industry enterprises at all.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respected foreign experts at the first word "war", leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
First, this is manipulation – most of these members of the supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, and so on.
Do not forget that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other jobs, and it is precisely the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical complaints against members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in a family. I have 2 children with me.

In Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the invaders, an enhanced curfew will be imposed for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "in the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5."
Details: according to the head of the regional state administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by Transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go to a shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kiev region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a word-to-word translation from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom I added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I already have an account. I made it in another bank. Because I had to have an account before work.
The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the purchase of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming more complex and globalized.

Security forces of the Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians aged 27 and 28 who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of Railway trains.
Source: Sovye Svaboda, Human Rights Center Viasna, head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of internal affairs Gennady kazakevich, quoted by the State Information agency BelTA
The Ministry of internal affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the power support of the SOBR special forces, and one was wounded.
According to" Viasna", during the arrest, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others received medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of internal affairs of Belarus, Gennady kazakevich, said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian Railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of Belarusian railways and the administrator of the Belarusian Railways thematic resources in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki, Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The Bipol formation, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian "rail partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, the Russian Federation transfers manpower and equipment to Ukraine through Belarus to fight.

US bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against Russian President Putin's subsidiaries, Russia's largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, while Alfa – Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
Private sector exits include manufacturers, energy companies, major retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions was restrictions on large Russian state-owned enterprises in a critical area.
This will prohibit US citizens from making transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the final part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including former president and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the passage is closed and I will approach you

We will be grateful for such help at such a difficult time for us.

Good evening, I can't help but share it with you. There is a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and in the ranks.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, who conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new communication neurons
Natalia Nagornaya, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was transmitted to her by the military of the 36th marine brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that " the bill goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which takes part in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 may be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command has a connection with the Defense Forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andrey Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by soldiers of the Regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, as long as we stay here
2 hours drive )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal
She forgot what she was going to do here
A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine since today.
Almost 50 professional copters🚁 will be used to detect, and some of them - to directly destroy the enemy invader💥
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Loubutenko.
Today their Intermountain friends are headed by the head of the village council and the coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101 / Vasyl Shchur delivered the drones to their intended destination: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in different cities where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters, we will keep their locations secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop there, they say: in the coming days, many more interesting "gifts" will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't worry, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do it without them
I'm worried we won't make it. Lots of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine and continue working
Okay. If everything is all right, I will agree
I will try myself , but if there are any problems I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We personally visited the headman's lady in the village in Yivov,she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing
Perhaps she will be happy and her mood will lift
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I was also frozen on the street.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.

I'm interested in what kind of music you have
mom and dad need to be obeyed
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
It was cooler and raining here today. It should be warm tomorrow.
But I don't feel sorry for the destroyed houses, I feel sorry for the people who are being bullied by the invaders
In Kherson, the invaders mocked the Memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: it is noted that unknown people tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those who died in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the fallen participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag was demolished.
Good morning, Thank you to the children for the Christmas carol, we do not have such a custom so we did not know, we gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given
There is someone to talk Czech to, if anything.
Because I live like in a dorm when there are twelve people here, and then they go to work
Hi, it's getting a little better.

Even today, I already slept there.
Therefore, we have already made great progress.
I will definitely bring dumplings another time!
today I don't have the strength to do them
Since I start from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say approximately for the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can say approximately in late April or early May.

If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't really want you to raise funds so that people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But two points were not enough for me to fill out online:

How will I be credited for the day that I was not at work I have a pass
Summary of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transdniestria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdniestrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally:"the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from carrying out provocative actions on the territory of the Transdniestrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: the enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for operations in the Slobozhansky direction.
Presumably, in the coming days, the invaders will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyrishche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of personnel of the Battalion Tactical Group units from the 36th separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the specified brigade are being recruited.
The enemy experiences a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
Departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of combat operations, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses an Orlan-10 UAV.
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dolgenke and Dmitrovka, but had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasnaya, Rubizhne, Nizhni and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct assault operations in the area of Zolotoye, but had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the Seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopolye, Trudolyubovka and Maryanskoe.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, The Defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
Of course, we will try to make it, but I doubt it
And you how can you you want to sleep and I'm holding you up
are you sure you don't mind me coming?
maybe you just don't want to see each other today, then tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We didn't even watch TV at home, and even more so 1 + 1. we don't need to set it up :)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
My monthly tariff package is running out today:)

I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she already gives us a lot of pies.
My father and I will meet later, we will definitely meet again
I read the ad on Facebook ,then apparently Google wrote something in its own way️️.  I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we have things that you brought and took, but there are things that are small for us can I bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about work.
If Mr. director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if possible, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it rains:)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know it perfectly, I dream of working for Teva
Old and not-so-old friends, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come for you, too.
I've been talking to many of you over the past month.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed about your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of what Ukraine is being subjected to on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of mine from Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, " Sasha replied laconically as usual. - Now after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others-cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of Thieves and fascists, and most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked for Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy, Medusa, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places – how many of you did anything to resist this regime?
Except perhaps for participating in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "it's too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your prolonged indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now probably put a big burden on your soul and heart?
This wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a certain degree of freedom and democracy-dirty, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the Tsar's back, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi, you took your heart out on the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lie low, renew itself, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between plundering the country and returning the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it or chose not to vote at all.
When he started razing Chechnya to the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I was working in Chechnya, helping victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar yurt, Itum Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I would return to Moscow and have fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank and danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me:"Brad, we are already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: "friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic recovery of the mid-noughties, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to turn a blind eye to the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found a better job.
Prices were rising, but is it really a problem?
Moscow shone festively and glittered with chic.
When several oppositionists were killed – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others-many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, it didn't go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of prime minister, as I see it, you barely paid attention to this.
When Russia invaded Georgia after months of Medvedev's rule, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi, or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I must admit that it is unlikely that we in the West have done much, if at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what did it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you came out en masse to protest.
Navalny's name became a household name, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands ended up behind bars.
Some got huge deadlines.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro – Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once seized the Maidan-and never left it again.
They built a tent city on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, rebar and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovich became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job poorly.
Putin didn't like Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it didn't do much good.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth suddenly emerged from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find the reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks like New after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012-with their binbags, public Wi – Fi, and hipster cafes.
Indeed, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it is only getting better.
You barely noticed Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I allegedly did not understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw State snipers shooting coolly at my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I didn't say anything – because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I didn't say anything – because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I didn't say anything – because I'm not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people are really talking now-like Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some-from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into the new gulag or keeping Navalny company.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, as it seems very likely, if he doesn't succeed – he will take on you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but mostly in private, went out to protest and still got off for a short time, but soon will get a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only in a black square on Instagram) or expressed yourself in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years in prison were given just for a joke are not so distant in the past – and now they are most likely waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians-even more so than in 2014 – scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage may be on paper.
Apparently, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that there is a war going on at all.
But you, my friends, are well aware of what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on your guard.
You understand where this is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a joke, your laws, if you don't count the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer there, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try to either leave somehow, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The Spark will not come from you: due to the impending economic collapse in Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized ones can be created.
There are a lot of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes down to it?
After everything he made them do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
If I were you, I'd be afraid, too.
Using the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be wasted.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat – and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online – and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years – and will only get worse, becoming more and more widespread.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday
We'll be home in the late afternoon
What do you think of me as a press secretary
Viko, how often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?
once on rtik I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked a very good one and we wanted something better so this is the best option
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. Tired energetically.
I don't feel well, cough, fever, Lost Voice, weakness and dizziness
I have to go to that Labor government
We have already done this,but we said who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month
On Thursday, you need a pass, we go with the children to the doctor.
But last night I received a letter from a lady who liked your work and would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'll be sure to let you know.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought that I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
I'm sorry for the lost time, but this is a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but monogamous and take marriage issues seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to start a family, people must love, respect, and trust each other.
I haven't met anyone like that yet.
Good afternoon. Where in Yiglava can I buy Easter baking pans(paper or silicone)?
Well, thank you for your advice, I will then now enter the certificate for Valya in the questionnaire
She has cerebral palsy in a supine state, her leg is now broken in a cast, the stroller is in a supine position, eda is all ground in a blender
Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry to Bother You outside of business hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Valery opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.
Can this really be the case?
Working hours of the room are until 16: 00.
And in the end, this is our responsibility.
But I do not load does not open the page very weak internet
