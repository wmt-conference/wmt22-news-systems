The application will help equip the workshops. For points earned by movement
Equip the timber workshop of the Hodonin Integrated School with new hand tools. All those who download the EPP Help by Moving app on their mobiles can now deserve to do that.
“With your movement you collect points, which you then credit to the account of our project. You don't have to be a race runner or cyclist, points are loaded even if you go dog walking or shopping, go for a walk or walk to work,” said the director of the Hodonin school, Eva Schmidová. The project came among the most interesting of the huge number of other applications for the CEZ Foundation. The application will only be active for a month.
The big return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Frenchz has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Frenchz, who has been going through a difficult time in his career in recent months, is heading back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the turn and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk got injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas he alternated, and as of this time he has not yet presented himself on the NHL rinks.
The incident happened at the moment the experienced goalkeeper was shifting from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Frenchman will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in his lower body,” announced the entirety from Denver in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning US time, he was summoned from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he credited 94,5% of interventions.
The breeding of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year and did not catch a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL “Francík” caught 36 games, his success rate is 92,3%.
Charles puts on Camille's drape at Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate selected a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, who used a photograph showing his consort Camille at horse races helping to put on a drape.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on this.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
Photography originated somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki-coloured summer dress, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, nor is it clear exactly when it originated.
Last year, for a photograph intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a straw bale in front of a pile of wood at their country mansion in the county of Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also posted by heir to the throne Prince Charles and wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at horse racing in Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat on his head and a drape on his face, helps Camille put on her colour-matched drape with the bright dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague — Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have promised one million crowns from Slavia in Prague league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz about this, saying that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice Club, stated that the red-white men did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly figures its former sports director Jan Nesmar, who finished at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is in the case also among the accused.
The CSI allegedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward for when he got his degree.
2019 SK Slavia Prague won the First League title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to have promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha from the officials of SK Slavia Prague, quoted the server from the file.
A day later, according to criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nesmar, but also with the chairman of the board Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer implies whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The contestant denied any corruption conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the proportions in Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed unlawful conduct, sought to influence referees in breach of fair play rules and have not granted any financial performance to anyone in this context,” it said Told for List Messages.
In intercepts, among other things, Nejmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's dark-skinned former players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was unleashed by a police crackdown in several places including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR last mid-October.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of football's functions.
In mid-January, he, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen must from the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover already managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold-war, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini man with Will Smith didn't ohormize criticism
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini (Gemini Man) prides itself on an interesting premise - Will Smith faces his younger version in the film. According to critics, however, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will see Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is a total cutting edge in his field. It kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. One day, though, he decides to hang his career on the nail. This is understandably not appealing to his employers, who send another hitman on Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more precisely his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined person manage to win a fight over himself? Literally this time.
A certain guarantee of quality should have been three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. Although it is his first science fiction, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the aforementioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the famous Game of Thrones. According to initial testimonals, even all this wasn't enough for a good movie.
“Even though Ang Lee tries big things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to bring it up,” thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily's server.
“This disappointing film is less than a tally of all the talent involved in it. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of filmmakers,” Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his opinion.
“Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an impossibly tired action movie,” Variety server reviewer Peter Deburge does not hide the disillusionment.
“A confused product made up with a bizarre idea,” Ella Kemp of the IndieWire website summed up the film in her review.
“It's hard to be interested in one man being a doppelganger of another when neither one behaves like a person,” wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap website.
I have a story.
Honitbu's right next to town.
They were climbing nutria out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the river bank.
I didn't want to mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course a fox went in a while.
I let her come to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
Poor fisherman nearly shat himself, waved his headband on all sides, so I called out to him it was on fox.
Before I got out of the sit-down, he was down.
I.e. I meadow man be pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably see in the thermal imaging that almost everyone is today.
So in a visible place, dear stuff you dat to noham in the spacak and you should be fine with your apartment.

Intraro got hold of respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy the runway?

Unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the documentary feature by Olga Špátová
This unique film performance from Olga Špátová's workshop will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
“In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me, and they asked me whether I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has endured more than half a century on the eminence of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence, was and is a great honour for me. I accepted the challenge of making a feature-length documentary film about Karl Gott, who has been bringing joy to three generations of listeners through his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer ,” director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, the first shooting day took place already on 22 October last year and the last footage with Karel Gott was shot a few days ago. The goal was, and is, abundantly clear - to capture authentically Karl Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father to his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and in fact all over the world. A man who has enrolled in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of Karl Gott's undisputed glory and his achievements. “Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film Phenomenon Gott with this one. Everyone is different. At least by filming them in a different stage of Karl Gott's life, and this will be very reflected in his personal, even intimate confession that he gave us and which has made us all believe in the way with which legend we have the opportunity to work and spend time, which is truly indescribable,” adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the country where he spent his childhood, and other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
“Olga has a great gift to film with her close team so that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics quite confidential. She and her husband, cinematographer Jan Painter, actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to feature the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life jubilee. But because I had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to keep spinning as long as possible. Well, and since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it be released into cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and everyone who supported and accompanied me in my profession,” says Karel Gott himself about the film.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which were done by older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be taken up by training, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover modern technology is still more complex, so The skills of the reservists will rapidly lose in time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to practice someone again.
And in the end, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it goes to lead a mass gerilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to remove the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where geril will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography for this.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the bureau allowed. But it has a catch
'The Office for Protection of Competition has authorised, subject to compliance with the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition, the concentration of competitors - XLCEE- Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other,” said Martin Švanda, a spokesman for ÚOHS.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it absorbed the Kika chain, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, they have to divest part of the bought company.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be authorized by antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year at a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before being taken over by Austrian company Signa, it belonged to South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. The latter faced problems when it revealed discrepancies in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Furniture and Kika, it belongs to the largest furniture retailers in the domestic market. The same owner has the brand Möbelix. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
They're only child. We don't have certain reproduction, but we don't have to haunt
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if only they convey the state of affairs. These include the word only child. Denotes a child growing up without siblings, but doesn't sound neutral. “You know that, an only child,” the saying goes, without much need to add. Interestingly, this trait has been borne by “only child” since recently, even from the days when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community already know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure a simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no country achieves this value in Europe today. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the simple reproduction rate of the population is not ensured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with an aggregate fertility of 3.1 child per woman.) It's a situation like done for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising that Maláčová, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs also falls for him: “There are almost as many only children as two-child families,” she said in an interview with LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good to highlight the problem instead of downplay or ideologize. Like in Germany, where campaigning for more children easily gets the label of fascounism (in the style of “so did Hitler support it”). It is good to recall that many couples only child directly plan. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, a weak extension of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let's draw attention to one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that “there are almost as many only infant”, there is a turkey of demagoguery. That statement was appropriate 20 years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last provided simple reproduction in 1980 (“Husák's Children”). Then it fell all the way to a menacing 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by nearly fifty per cent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is the European above average. This is still not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with that alarmism can they take a little slack.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and tackling the housing crisis. Buys 6000 flats from private firm
Berlin will buy back from private Luxembourg firm ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion crore) 6000 former social apartments sold by the city 15 years ago. It thus responds to pressure from the public, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rent prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest ever such buyout in the history of the capital of Germany. The opposition criticizes the move.
“The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give security to tenants,” Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. “At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze,” he added. The municipal firm Gewobag will take over 1,000 apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf neighborhoods in the western part of the city this December.
The city bought too dearly, according to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler. He told the Bloomberg agency Rothäusler that, in his estimate, housing units overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation by their procedure. The FDP put it on twitter on Friday. The move was branded a “waste of money” by the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Already in mid-July Gewobag had acquired 670 apartments on Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The award was not disclosed by the council at the time. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition avenue from the GDR times accompanied protests and filled the front pages of the German press. He became a symbol of the plight of tenants in Germany's major cities, the paper wrote.
At the same time, the German metropolis used to be renowned for its low cost of living and low rentals. But in recent years it has gained on attractiveness. Rent prices have doubled over the past decade, according to AFP, with some residents finding it difficult to find affordable housing.
mainly we don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they have one.
Then there is such a situation that you watch a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes back, goes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 swiss and you're like “tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?”.
Well, of course they're gonna make him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this “flood your defender” skill is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to play one player of the opponent.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! He ended up in the
It was about nerves. Allegedly troubled son Ondrej (9) was harshly punished by his father every moment. “He came from school and lied with a snack. Luke looked at me and said he would kneel for punishment,” Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Luke made little Ondra kneel in a corner for several hours! Outside the cameras, he said he had to suffer like that on a wooden base to massage his feet! “Ondrej came to me after filming and said to me - aunt, I'm making the trouble and the remarks just so I'm not here because I want to go to the institute,” Lucie described the moment she fully understood what happened behind the studio door going on. And the boy's wish eventually came true...
His condition was so serious that he was removed from the family after filming and placed in the Centre of Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. “When I got home, Aneta immediately added me on facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I almost didn't react to that at all. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in the institution, that then they gave it back to them, now it's in the diagram. They are both out of work,” says mother Lucie from Pilsen.
Lightning, of course, also addressed the other side, but only got a nebulous answer. “I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later,” Aneta spoke out, hanging up the phone.

Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast thrived
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. He was dragged upwards by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 or technology firm Avast. Conversely, Austrian titles and media company CME did not fare well. It follows from the results of trading on the exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually topped off with a small profit. “However, in the whole week (the PX index) lost slightly over one percent,” said Josef Dudek of Fio Bank.
Domestic banks partially corrected declines from the past days. Komerční banka improved 0.82 percent to 803 kroner and Moneta Money Bank 0.41 percent to 72.80 crore. Avast shares appreciated 0.89 percent to 113 kronor and operator O2 notched up 0.46 percent to $216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, up 1.38 per cent to 294 kronor. Less than a percentage was acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
Securities of energy firm CEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
Loss-making were three titles - Erste Bank wrote down 0.87 percent to 779.20 kroner, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurer VIG 0.40 percent to 618 kronor.
The krone weakened slightly against both major currencies. On the euro, it lost four pennies to CZK 25.85/euro, on the dollar three pennies to $23.62/USD. This follows from the data on the Patria Online server.
First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting some major reversal for the weeks ahead.
The onslaught in hospitals according to statistical models will last some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is known, the omikron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to which vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous disease helps against it.
But this week an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 per cent from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the incoming medicines is here administration ready.
As it was said, Merck's molnupiravir reaches domestic patients first.
The company ended up on tape first even because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatments for equine viral disease in South America of the continent.
What's often neglected with this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking “how our beak grew.”
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you that no.
In the West they tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist crap.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
Afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they actually find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
French Oscar candidate Misers to launch Be2Can parade
The Golden Bear and both the recipients of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the directing award and the jury prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, too, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most spectacular and stimulating presented by the competitions of three of Europe's most important film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Miserants, for which Ladj Ly, the author of the film, took home the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The premiere of the film in Prague will be presented personally by the representatives of the two main roles of police officers of the Crime Squad, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-writer of the film's screenplay.
Be2Can will take place this year at Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas in Prague, Brno (Cinema Art), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
Director Ladj Ly's directorial feature film debut was screened and praised at a number of other world festivals following its success at Cannes. It won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award at the IFF Durban, and it was also screened at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be shown in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, audiences can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Disrupter, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We Did Not Cast You, Anthology of Ghost Town and The Golden Glove movie. But there may also be other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, the Joker, to the Czech triumph of the Inked Birds.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the spin of units, so that soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory whether for safety or the speed of deployment of warheads because of a more westerly position.
In those underground enclosures (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire rocket as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived and retrieved this warhead and mounted it on some kind of carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, there are those left in a desolate state.
Babiš in terror victims memorial called for security cooperation
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited Ground Zero in New York City on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all states of the world should be fighting against together. At the conclusion of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš declared it today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
“This is a very touching place,” the prime minister said as he laid a white rose near the names of Lukas Rambousek and Czechoslovak émigré Alena Sešínova, accompanied by his wife Monica. Both were among more than 2750 dead claimed by the hijacked aircraft attack on the former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, there is now a monument in their place with a name list of victims.
“It is necessary to remind ourselves of what happened here, the horror,” Babiš said. The September 11, 2001 attack on the US was described by the Prime Minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed into a Defense Department building in Washington by a hijacked plane and planned to have another strike on a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this aircraft crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
“This is our main enemy, there all the countries of the world should come together and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way,” the Czech prime minister added.
At the second level of primary school we had a classmate of Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to make a light, missed a little, went regularly, did sports with us, did not steal snacks, or phones, walked cleanly clad.
He went to schools in nature, did various monkey shops, but he was cool, perhaps never any trouble.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings joined, cigans to the same grade, different grades.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, often dealt with something by the police there, threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sell sometimes something on an ad (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and I sold often to Ciganas, money always had, did not try to make any attempts to stretch me on price, communication in tranquility.
I even sold a car like this, a guy called in a month saying he had already rewritten it on himself..
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise as long as they behave the way they belong in a decent society (works, works, doesn't beat women, simply common behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, outlets apartments and houses, he just has a mess around him, makes trouble.. so it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs too.
Young woman died in car crash on Prachatick
“The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene,” Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unidentified reasons, drove out in a bend into the opposite direction.
After colliding with Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the roadway, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the crash.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his discharge, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was transported to the hospital in České Budějovice by air, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered a lighter chest injury and was rushed to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often fail to supply details about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly acquires collectible cards.
“Typically, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly expensive, and now he has to add VAT and the post office hand over the data to the customs procedure.
An email arrives to him, telling him that customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then you just need to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader already at the sale, the customs office will rate it out of the total amount for the consignment and transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's mostly a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments manage to deliver smoothly, though.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad decreased from 60 thousand to 15 thousand at the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently there are 30 thousand shipments in the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data needed and filled them in on time, we would be about half of it here, says Matyáš Vitík, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
Strict but fair, hours keep us entertained! This is how Benešov gymnasists see their favorite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in any good book, Paul Hoza believes. The secondary teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, prose writer and builder of literary life in a small town.
Above the texts of Pavel Hoza, Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country buildings, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old ways and people who have been after them for centuries. Mourning, kneeling, blessing. This contemporary continuator of Reynk teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, in the café na slovíčko he runs a parallel of Prague Viola and annually organizes Benešovský literary festival.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should be doing to slow, or compensate for that growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where it rushes?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford regular things, mainly energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I got added 2% in gross this year, which is a travesty, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.

The vote of the Canadian Parliament's upper house has been a familiar rumor for days: Canada is taking away honorary citizenship from former legend of the struggle for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title because of her involvement in the genocide against the minority Rohing nation.
Suu Kyi's decision to take honorary citizenship was agreed by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously backed it. “It is the right message for both her and Myanmar and for the whole world,” independent senator Ratna Omidvar commented on the decision of her colleagues. “We need to make it clear that accomplices of genocide here in Canada are not welcome - all the more like upstanding citizens.”
The Canadian Parliament's verdict technically does not change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The longtime human rights campaigner's silence on the atrocities that the army of majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months on the Muslim minority Rohing is unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organized genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens, was brought about by a UN report recently. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - “shocks both by the frightening of their actions and the enormous scale”. Suu Kyi and her led administration, according to the UN, were guilty of complicity primarily by covering the actions of the soldiers and draining around them by protecting a fog of lies - for example, that it was a ' counter-terrorism operation”.
After Suu Kyi is removed, five personalities remain on Canada's honorary citizens list: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th Imam Shia Muslims and Malala Yúsufzaj.
The development around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy was also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile added information about atrocities against the Rohingas and the parliamentary decision to take away her title of honorary citizen. “We have also muted the enlightening of her photo on a board depicting the timeline of the struggle for human rights, and we are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of some member of the Rohingya minority,” they cite Canadian media museum spokesman Rorie McLeod.
The only thing that will remain so in Suu Kyi's current upheaval - at least so far - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Vaclav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the struggle for democracy. “While Ms Suu Kyi's current venue is regrettable, her award will not be annulled,” Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten told CBS of Canada.

Top prosecutor resumes prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
The top prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittals of the mother, who had long manipulated her daughter and interfered with her relationship with her father. She faced an indictment of mistreatment and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her of the indictment, Zeman disagrees with it. In a similar conduct, an offence can be seen under his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ruling could have a broader impact on other caucuses. “A more specific definition of such a specific form of mistreatment can also be considered necessary in terms of regulating further application practice,” says Zeman's call.
Last year, the Svitava District Court first found the woman guilty of mistreatment of an entrusted person and endangering the upbringing of a child. With her daughter, she was forming a strong or symbiotic bond, even in a situation where she was supposed to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship to the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened self-harm in case of being handed over to the custody of her father.
The Svitava court imposed two years in prison on the mother with a two-year probation reprieve. But the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appeal proceedings, it is not said to be a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the county court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered him once to rule again.
The Regional Court found that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards another are not exceptional. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only exceptionally, the solution is criminal law.
However, according to the top prosecutor, the woman committed both mistreatment and endangering her upbringing. “The accused acted quite purposefully when she raised negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and purposefully hardened these negative emotions. By such actions, she not only pursued the unlawful intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must necessarily have been aware that this would cause negative in the psychosocial sphere of the minor consequences,” he stands in the call.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once more to the regional court. The invocation imply that the child is now under the care of the father.

Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists put themselves behind bars for maybe only 6 months?
This just doesn't take away my head, how a court can only send an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for a few years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And that's not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
First Miss Christová finally went into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately peeked through
The first modern Miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had problems with excess weight for years, which caused her not only physical problems, but especially psychological ones. She suffered due to the fact that she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she took the rebukes to heart and, with the extra pounds, went into battle. Even if it's a long haul run.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris as well. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christova can only remember the beauty pageant. Not just because of fame, but also because of how skinny she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slender as possible and not to eat often. She decided to stop listening and started indulging in what she's really into.
But from hunger strikes she switched to overeating, which immediately signed on her figure. The extra kilos tried to disguise themselves with various loose clothes, which added to the fluffing shapes even more dimension.
Now it looks like Ivana went really into herself. Visibly losing weight, she began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
Everyone present surprised at the christening of the book Miloš Zapletal (75), that she once again peeked through and already has back the features of a charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after revolution, but also by what controversy her victory provoked.
Christová will forever be the first winner of beauty, but also the very first to whom the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled as senses deprived when she put on her crown.
Repair of Krkonoše museum will be delayed for a year
The Krkonoše National Park Administration (KRNAP) moved the deadline for submission of bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original envelope-opening deadline was September 20, said Radek Drahny, a spokesman for the national park. The reason for moving the deadline for submitting bids is to reduce the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
“We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There's been a change in the budget, it's about the price we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, then work will begin as much as possible,” Dear said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the museum repair is about a year behind schedule. KRNAP wanted to have a selected construction part contractor by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
The administration of KRNAP is failing to choose the construction company to repair the museum. It listed the second competition this summer because in the previous tender all the company's offers significantly exceeded the then projected price of 65 million. Bids exceeded 100 million kronor.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should arrange the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of a new exposition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The KRNAP visitor centre should be created in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the conversion of the expositions.
A repaired museum with a new interactive exhibit, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve for visitors as representative entrance gate Krkonoše. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains as understandable as possible and motivate people to explore the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities to host concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans are to build a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or cafe.
Grave man 'burnt' his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The Grave man inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her himself.
But he went a round of it.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not enough to wonder when the alleged “robbed” told them that he had made everything up to allow officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted advice from the constables on how to file the notification to the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers then discover that the woman is on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant is placed on her.
The case is therefore handled by the Czech Republic.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally Slavs since, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme, too bad Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Unclarified death of a little girl (†8) in Příbramsk: Punishment does not await the culprit
Unclarified cases are called “memorials” in criminalistic slang. But even those are being investigated if new information emerges years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley, the old one then 12 years old in 1980. “A 1955 case? That's going to be tough, very hard. It would like to find a file for starters, it may no longer exist, talk to those who investigated it. Hope is always there, but it would be really hard,” says Markovic.
Under the past regime, the public did not get much informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they would be investigated laxly. “It always mattered about specific people,” the CSI thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although unsealed cases should not be shredded.
Tech firms want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history has been somewhat baked out by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist, in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man, wrote: “That, what we may be witnessing... is the final point of the ideological evolution of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance.”
Twenty-six years later, we are rather seeing how, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, rather models of illiberal triumph and different forms of nationalism thrive and different forms of nationalism and of radicalism. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to match the onset of these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is rethinking many of his former standpoints: he argues that ideas of socialism should be brought back into the public space and Marx he was right in many times. While at the same time, he insists that his thought development is still consistent with that of the 1990s, and critics of The End of History and the Last Man are said to have misunderstood it correctly.
“What I was saying at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than just that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point, and therefore associate themselves into groups according to identity that give them a sense of belonging.”
In its day, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists, who viewed communism as the final stage of history. When asked about how he now views the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: “It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about the ownership of the means of production, then except when clear services of the public are in demand, I think it will not work. But if you are referring to redistribution programs that attempt to address the huge imbalances in income and wealth we are already seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. That long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher kicked off, and in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the word, was in many ways disastrous effect.”
Ultimately, Fukuyama attempts to calm the current situation as well, warning all liberals that even the emergence of new not entirely democratic regimes will not spell the end of history.
Well I don't know, it's quite a question whether or not a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that there is at least one god in any of those thousands of religions that will punish you unnicely if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no god but Yahweh.
So it wouldn't be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god than to risk picking the wrong way out of those thousands of gods and that one real god I didn't exactly hit me for this he sends to hell or some similar place?
Uncombed wants 45 million after state
The Ministry of Justice, according to Vladimir Řepka's office spokesman, has received six requests so far in this connection and is now analyzing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting the woman, but the justice finally exonerated him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both Chief Prosecutor Pavel Zeman and Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the then 20-year-old student of the Neached grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times over the head with a log and took her over ten thousand crowns. A seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by doctors of the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed from the outset, he denied any guilt. “I'm innocent and I swear by that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the damaged, but I am not the perpetrator,” the young man said earlier in court, who did not deny that he was at the hairdresser's fateful day. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after his wife told him he was already closing. He then turned himself in to police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him first as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later called Uncombed as the attacker. According to court experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court has successively handed down five verdicts in the case. First of all, he pleaded guilty twice and imposed 16 years in prison on him, the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed gradually headed behind bars twice, but each time after the intervention of the Supreme Court he went free. After the ordered exchange of the judicial chamber, repeatedly acquittals eventually fell, with the last one this March upheld by the High Court.
At the same time, Jiří Lněnička, the President of the Board of Appeal stated that the decision was wrong, but he said he had no better option given the procedural situation. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquitting verdict, even though her appeal objections were justified.
“The problem with this thing is not that there is a lack of evidence, but their assessment. We consider that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the pre-trial proceedings that would suffice richly in another criminal case for the recognition of guilt,” said Lněnička.
But the Hradec and Supreme Court also looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not have changed the next revocation of the acquittal judgment.
Other: Voluntary training followed by enlistment in the reserves.
The Swiss model, I suspect, is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If one would do well then he can get a pro offer.
All the files of the Czech Republic could use something like that.
You could do this in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly getting ready, companies are hunting in schools and a kind of intermingling takes place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions into employment relations.
Not only in adolescence, but this process happens constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian raider will never break in again.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and so they will defend us if we get in trouble.
Well, please the frying pan.
All it takes is one election in the US that will twist their budget and all NATO goes into a screw.
The Anglans will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown once that just show them their backs and take whatever they want.
The only thing that has been a guarantor of independence for a long time is the armed army and the population who can master military equipment of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what could not be.
We don't need a border fortification, that sucks today, but the charmed teenager behind the remote control device book can do it.
Kovosvit sells the administration building and other halls. Expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Cook's main problems include worker shortages and subcontractor shifts. This year, demand for machine tools has fallen, down 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. “The expected decline in turnover on the order of ten per cent is also related to this,” the chief executive said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion kroner and profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the office building, where of the five floors use two, and not yet entirely. “Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to reduce Kovosvit and streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of a solution for the moment, whether it is, for example, cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development,” he said CEO.
About half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Chef is one of India's most interesting, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year also the firm exported two five-axis machines for 30 million kronor to China. “Another contract in the same volume is negotiated, which we would like to fulfill by the end of the year,” said Cook. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions because of sanctions.
Last year, the firm sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is subcontracted to Airbus. She delivered another machine this May; she should deliver one more at the end of the year or early 2020.
This year's main investment was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker wage is 28,500 kroner. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundry, machining, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The enterprise has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The firm had its time up to three thousand employees.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's latest album is released posthumously
Thanks for the Dance will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him complete the songs. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months after that, Adam Cohen began working on materials left with his father. He invited a variety of musicians to collaborate - at random Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or singer Beck.
“When we invented music for our father's words, we used his own distinctive musical practices. So he's always with us,” Adam Cohen said on the album. “What amazes me most about him is the reactions of those who have heard him before. One by one they say Leonard is still alive,” he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal (Goal). “I'm almost alive, I'm almost home,” Cohen sings in his characteristic honeyed voice. He sang about death, suspecting that he wouldn't live to see the release of new material. He also admitted it in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before he died. “I'm ready to die. I hope it doesn't get too uncomfortable,” he declared.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the name Plamen on 31 December by Argo Publishing House.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home wrapped with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved shop (the map of the KamsNim.cz project contains nearly 150 of them).
This will encourage small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market and also the money saved, as packaging cardboard has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics, is also one such store.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who are accumulated at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular cartons.
We use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more respectful world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to the next generations, says Petra Lopushníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KamsNim.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, high volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would be otherwise unnecessarily become waste”, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Utidy Czechia association.
Managers of state-owned firms are now supposed to go through the selection process. Law will be circumventable, opposition claims
“This is a typical bill that is unnecessary,” said Zbyněk Stanjura, the chairman of the ODS deputies club.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics talk about the mobiles - in state-owned firms in the future. Newly candidates should go through the selection process at the given ministry and will also be considered by the Government Committee on Personnel Nominations.
But it is a compromise solution, which ODS, for example, does not like because it will supposedly allow ministers to make excuses that select panels may be responsible for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding on the Minister. The novelty must still be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
It seems bad to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and crapproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computing skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because like Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and bend everything on one screen in the app.
Feel free to use the technique since childhood, but especially let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron set out the priorities of France's EU presidency before the weekend — starting in January — and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for Europeans to be protected — at work, on the street — and mentioned so many events that they can't be made in half a year.
But French politicians like it that way, and voters like it too.
Macron's supporters, straddling the right and the left, agree on a few, but Europe does.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar affected priorities themselves as well.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe”, and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed criticisms that Macron was about pro-European propaganda and was rewriting history.
In fact, it's trying to defend the rewriting of history.
Far-right candidate for French president Éric Zemmour is hugging France right now with the thesis that the Vichy regime that collapsed with Hitler in World War II wasn't so bad, and has quite a bit of success with that with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries learn history as an us versus them story and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech “Mice” did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for director and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he held on to the first rungs of the audience chart.
The best actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like “having the flu/being stuffed” I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to regular flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with flu.
(Personal experience only. I don't say everyone has it that way)

Those who stayed, and those who left, know too little about each other to venture out on a life together.
Kristýna Plíšková did not pass the final, second title eludes her so far
The Plíšková environment in Tashkent testified, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and also this year she did very sovereign.
After wins with Paolini, Kawaova and Kužmova, she fought her way among the top four female players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck didn't turn out well for Kristýna. Belgičanka kept her serve and broke Plíšková's service twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková soon went into a 3:0 lead and the twist was no longer successful to Kristýna, although she managed to eventually turn into one of the glasses. In the last one she turned away one swordboat, but at the second one came the end.
Czechs in Europe Ondrej Housky: Should Czechoslovakia reject the Munich Agreement and go to war with Germany in 1938? Three times NO
The undated picture depicts Adolf Hitler as he visits the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies engaged.
If almost exactly 81 years ago Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would put the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Perhaps it would not be one of these weapons, even though the Germans had overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses — due to blistering.
Zeman by the monument - Man straining constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who move in the camp's divided society and doesn't want to completely fool, will welcome situations where they don't have to cheer only for their own. When he can admit pluses even to whom he otherwise criticizes. No longer so that he doesn't feel that he orientates himself only according to pre-allocated stickers. Such situations include a list of badly damaged monuments that President Zeman fences on his favorite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what it is. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, many of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and farmhouses - see for themselves. Everyone knows that demagoguery can come to the word here, too. That if we relate to City Hall's failure to care for monuments or some horror in the master plan, may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state local policy urges: “A section of the monument law allows you to fine owners of objects who do not care about their property.” But even if the owner is unreachable, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforceability. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex issue. But he's positioning himself for a good cause much like squaters, which he doesn't recognize himself. Two years ago we wrote: “Despite all the swear words squaters highlight a problem standing outside the current interest. The fact that this or that construction is in disrepair.” And let's admit the president is doing the de facto same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be astonished at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At the time Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and thaler minting (for Americans dollars). Why? It said because of fast-paced home sales in the 1990s, officials there say. But what is it that seven kilometers away Ostrov, the residence of the Šliks who stamped the Jáchymov thalers, has the historical core repaired nicely? It is good if the President points out these things.
Trains start running according to new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the time of departure is adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Ticket sales started by carriers already during the fall.
Czech Railways plans to make an average of 6783 passenger services daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Runways alongside domestic connections under the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The firm will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains of the carrier will travel in North Moravia or Western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Runways factor inflation into their fares annually.
The biggest change in the timetable of the RegioJET is the entrance to line R23 Ústí nad Labem — Mělník — Nymburk — Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Daily, RegioJet will make a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two return services to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Kraków.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar travel times of its long-distance trains as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arrivy trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the single rail fare for the second year running.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and they had to nap, dying.
I haven't heard teaching in my life from the perspective of the slave party or from that era, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
Nobody even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
Nobody will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I spent some time in the US too, right in schools, both in the more northern schools and the Southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone deliberately obfuscating the facts, but I've heard before that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny that (like in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was more likely that history isn't black and white, and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in someone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way while we're at those Southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand they too had some good successes and I found it absurd to repudding them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better, as enough people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was slave owners, and a lot of things went wrong with them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view doesn't exist (there was a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our Legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that at some universities it was appalling, those students were pretty radicalised and those schools supported them in it as many times.
And if I imagine these people are going to be a lot older someday, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the vote of the majority, because among the young it is and in the ruling elite as well.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it's not about the same anymore, it's radicalized.
At present, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological fact, so other groups like LGBT and it leads to radicalization even to the opposite side where it often leads to a backlash even for pretty reasonable things.
Plus the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I was more likely to encounter the wrong geography, that was but ambidextroduct:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because that, I think, is completely groundless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Furthermore, I find the concept of nationality overall useless in terms of some personal identity.
If something has me with people, interests, worldviews and common experiences, not where we were born.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over contracts for promotion
Police have charged former manager of state agency CzechTourism Aleš Pangrác over contracts for promotion. Server Pangrak ListNews confirmed that he took over the charge this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers in the case were looking into contracts worth 38 million crowns. Some of the money was going back to Pangrac, according to police, the server reports. In the case, criminalists were also interested in Minister for Regional Development Klára Dostálová (for ANO), to which CzechTourism is a resort. The investigation in the case, according to the server, continues.
Detectives from the National Headquarters Against Organised Crime were securing evidence in this case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court search order at Dostální, which was previously cited by CT, said that the Minister decided in 2016, when she was deputy, on CzechTourism's expenditure in favour of CzechTourism the chosen persons vicariously and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she had no doubt, she could document everything and was fully cooperating with the police.
According to the agency, it was about individual misconduct. The media has previously reported that it was a former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was removed due to the results of the audit. It emerged that the agency CzechTourism concluded 48 problematic contracts.
“Yes, they charged me. But I don't want to comment on it any more,” Pangrác told the North List News.
Toyota hydrogen still confident preparing second-generation Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a sort of concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no infrastructure in the world to pump hydrogen, it nevertheless deployed it to the menu. Not quite standard, the customer had to really purposefully go after this car, but no one else offered such a variant at that time.
At an international conference on hydrogen, Toyota chief Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed that a new generation will arrive next year. Indeed, Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will equal hybrids in price within a decade. Of course, this is associated with the development of pumping networks. But the future is as connected to hydrogen as electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen often inflected with the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to overcome on one refueling long distance. That purely cordless versions cannot offer. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, trusts hydrogen propulsion, Hyundai, which now also offers the hydrogen crossover Nexo.
Insects are up to 60 times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is represented in nature more than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But reports are increasing, according to which the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic came out just this week, and the situation, according to her, is still much more serious than humanity has yet realized.
The study is based on field research in a tropical forest on Puerto Rico, in which US scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write immediately in the introduction of the report, insects are “ten to sixty times less” in the forest today. It is about the decline of the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research involved not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is thinning as well.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. The average air temperature in the forest, according to them, has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. The study thus shows, according to the author's team, that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously predicted.
A major article in the Washington Post newspaper came out on Monday about the report, which gives the new findings right away in the headline as hyperalarming. “It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read,” entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whose paper cites as an independent expert, told the paper.
Insect extinction also affects Europe. “In our country, the decline is also an order of magnitude,” points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, besides climate change, landscape transformations, which play an essential role in Europe, must also be taken into account. “In our country it only runs significantly longer than in Puerto Rico,” adds Čížek to explain why scientists could have measured such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
Nokia is suing a Brno firm over the Lokia name. People don't mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia has filed objections to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, confusion of products is not likely.
A Brno firm developing CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the Brno warehouse management firm's program is called Lokia WMS, wrote the newspaper E15. Nokia therefore filed objections to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV judges that a mix-up is not likely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers, it has been on the market since last September.
“The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and confidence around the world. When someone attempts to register a mark that we believe may result in confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset,” Nokia spokesman Mark said The Durrant.
Brno developers say that they did not think about the brand made famous in the past by mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. The designation of Lokia by CCV is based on the Latin name for one species of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be an analogy of the movement of warehousemen around the warehouse.
“There is little likelihood of confusion on the Czech market. We sell modern cloud software that companies equip their warehouse operations, and we're not really heading into the field of mobile phone manufacturing. And we do not want to be likened to a brand, which may have a train in his field,” said CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
CCV applied for brand protection in August before the programme was marketed with the Industrial Property Office. “Protection sought for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, since the software belongs to Class 9, related services of management of business activity in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to international classification,” said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the legacy Nokia trademark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus applies to the widest possible range of products and services, and therefore, of course overlaps also in grades 9, 35 and 42. 'The CCV does not dispute the objecting claimant's claim as to conformity on these classes of products and services. Really, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups,” said Ondrášek.
A brand dispute can take months, according to E15, and it may complicate the firm's activities.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak pastor is an awfully fine guy, he has a sermon more about theology than politics, but then he always discards some cocootine about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services to the Hussites because it's a lot like theologically, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michala in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00pm they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav — Plamínek sparked in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna because of the coronavirus pandemic, but even this time they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal — Břeclav.
They took it on the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the troop and I participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, Scout Amalie Budíková told the journalists present.
Whereas last year the transfer took place at the border crossing Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the crossing Reintal — Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually for him, though, scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes about the delivery of flame around the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the Scouts traditionally travelled by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday 18 December by scout couriers who will travel by selected speeders and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in stations, who will then continue to spread flames around the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going on similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events, to wear drape, of course, try to observe spacing, there were as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just behave In order to make it as safe as possible, the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light Action, Zuzana Hrbková, described.
The tradition of Bethlehem light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies overall.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it hacks the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I work in a factory where there are a million “xy funded/co-financed by project xy” message boards in the corridors, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is a brake on development when this company both sticks and takes orders/employees to companies that could grow and be after its demise more productive
Purposeful slurs? Ústí nad Labem Zoo is looking for a new vet, no one is interested
Most recently late this month. The management of the city attributed this to the slander that swarmed around the former director of the zoo and also veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposeful killing exotic animals he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros Zamba, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan Naponika.
The city council therefore declared a new contract. “For veterinary care for a zoo with an estimated value of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the city Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2,8 million crowns excluding VAT,” approached city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Neerrovaová (UFO) explained that the city is thus announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. “Doctor Revived had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it the blatant dehonestation of such a quality expert,” she noted.
Experts specialized in exotic animals, according to her, are very few. “It's definitely nothing pleasant. Meanwhile, the zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders,” she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. “But in terms of funding, the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act,” explained Nikola Roštejnská, a spokeswoman for the zoo.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. He participated, for example, in a unique operation in which Jane, the Cheetah of Ústí, received a total endoprosthesis as the first cheetah in the world. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. Anonymous has not commented on his person in any way. Yesterday he did not receive phone calls or respond to text messages by SMS.
As far as the contracts for the zoo are concerned, some veterinarians think that in zero interest in it there is not necessarily concern about similar purposeful charges, as in his case, but simply little outreach. For example, Jiří Král, an Ústí veterinarian, has not yet heard of her. “I hear it from you for the first time. Nobody approached us. That kind of thing will, I think, spread quickly,” he added.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she was kissing Lucia White!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar (translated by M*dat Age) Simona Krain posted her last pictures of herself in which she is completely naked! “I was a little worried about people condemning me, of taking pictures naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when she wants to, it's even at 46 years old to have a solid figure. Of course, there is toil and renunciation behind it, but otherwise it can not be done.”
“With Lukáš Dvořák we took about three thousand photos, chose about a hundred and there are twelve on the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked,” the model confided to Flash, who also came very exposed at her baptism.
She had an elongated Bernhardt blazer and underneath shorts that weren't visible, so it looked like she'd forgotten her bottom. Everyday jogging has made her legs stronger, so she can afford similar models.
Simona took such joy in success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucie Bílá.
Total consent, it's horrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet era also gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet ads don't move with me, but then I catch on anyway, that they also affected me - it's just so messed up that a person doesn't always resist it.
For that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of a classic - I would ban those internets.
In the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná was burning, no one was injured
The underground of the CSA mine in Karvina was burning this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, said for ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a fault at a depth of about 1200 metres. “Nothing happened to any of the staff, no one was hurt. Ban rescuers immediately intervened on the scene, who eliminated the fire by direct intervention and carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible,” the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karvinsk region, coal is already mined only in the Karvinsk part, namely in the mines of CSA, Lazy, Darkov, CSM-North and CSM-South. In the Lazy Mine, mining should end this year, and the other mines await a gradual downturn. The OKD mining company is the only producer of bituminous coal in the Czech Republic, its output last year was 4.62 million tonnes. There are 9000 people working in the mines.
Ja mam feeling from this virus ma roots in (but predominantly in point 1):
1. “I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion about which I will argue is crytic thinking”
2. “I won't believe everything the media says”
3. “I don't trust politicians”
TVs have plummeted the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles — Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, giving their viewers a premiere this year will present a record of more than two hundred.
It was calculated by movie database operator IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring in the audience in recent years and significantly increases viewership, therefore more and more of these films are being created.
Four times as many Christmas films have been made this year than in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will be much more holiday movies in real life.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are especially fairy tales associated with this period; globally popular are also the films Home Alone, Love Heavenly or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the true boom in Christmas pictures kicked off only in 2009, when the US cable TV station Hallmark came with a special film series, recalled the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
“In this magical period, the story does not matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies).
'For viewers, it's a form of escapism and a way for at least two hours to feel a bit of peace amid all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years, 'he added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for his films, which, while uniform, is successful.
You have two people falling in love with each other, but then some misunderstanding arises about half an hour before the end, which will be resolved and the two kiss.
It's been like this over and over, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar vibe, people watch one after another, complements Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he won't hit the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he took in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Priz after all.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, from the last rung Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will be in a direct battle for the title Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin, according to the observations of the Haas stable, is quite fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders,” its representatives for formula1.com said.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can he.
A possible alternate would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not faced with the first competitor.
At the start of the just ending season Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19, last year Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for this, too.
And everybody's gonna give a damn that the boss said.
In terms of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group, as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid fever.

Pike in a pond, or a relatively well-off open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt for his optimistic view. Or the figure that our country is twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 countries assessed, according to one recent study.
However, in a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development, the developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot also reported other, not so “rosy” data. For example, the Czech Republic is ranked 154th in the world in the speed of construction procedures. It may well be that the current economic “boom” will not leave behind any significant builder's legacy as it has in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but the slow, underperforming bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to use the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions increase, but people with better living standards will also want to have a place to live, travel modernly and quickly, have quality cultural stalls, live without unbearable ecological burdens.
But for example, in the capital city of Prague, it has been unable to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a speedway or subway to the airport for years. And Prague doesn't even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason is not only absurd scuffles about architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservativism, which adheres to the motto “every bolder change is for the worse”.
And when it seems that something bolder might be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by conservationists or other somewhat demurred associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the “blob” of Jan Kaplický designed for the new building of the National Library, even President Václav Klaus wanted to join the dredgers.
However, the enumeration does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to finish its backbone motorway network or start building train speedways, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna” detour” through Bavaria. In addition, repairs of existing infrastructure are also drowning in schlendrian. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a rebusable.
Babiš came into politics with a promise to “make things happen.” In terms of meaningful investments and accelerating cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened yet. Since 2018, although an amendment to the Act on Acceleration of Transport Infrastructure Construction is in force, but we will have to wait for more extensive beneficial impacts such as easier expropriation of land. And the new building law, approved by the government, which is said to shorten the current average length of construction procedure from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, begin to apply from 2021. Many people probably wouldn't bet on it.

Declaration of the End of the Right in the House or What is the “right-wing” coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Recently, there have been reports of a forthcoming coalition of said parties in the media and commentary. Many applaud that the “right” is finally getting its act together, but I wonder why these parties still refer to themselves as right-wing.
If I disappear the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects label themselves or what labels are parroted by the mainstream media. ODS is hardly centre-ground in its average of that party's top politicians, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and so hypocritically denotes as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, by its concept, ideology and voter targeting, essentially coalesces with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU even labels itself as centre-back for a long time - but their political compass is far more to the left than they say themselves.
Do you feel like I took all of the water clean? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, to me the highest value is individual freedom, the free market, and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do said parties fulfill this general assumption of rightwingness? How many laws cutting people's freedoms with the sausage method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to or supporting the socialist EU environmental and gender craze have fostered in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not custom stickers, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all kinds of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingedness.
Coalition cooperation TOP 09, STAN and KDU I would not be at all wondering, on the political map they simply belong together and excluding Christian or conversely homosexualist and gender aspects in them for voters in the sense of the state's influence on their lives I basically don't see the obvious difference. Nevertheless, ODS has long portrayed itself as “the only right-wing” and by associating with these three entities no longer coverly reveals its true political inclusion.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned those stickers. Have you noticed how often all of these parties refer to critics of dirigism and socialism coming out of the European Union as pro-Russian agents, quite identically and cheaply? Can they or just don't want to understand that there are many people who do not smell as strongly about Eurosocialism and growing unfreedom as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Ain't they concealing their total argumentative incompetence and gratuitous or blind adoration of euro-union circumstances by any chance?
It is simply possible that in the Czech Republic, other than center politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe that kind of bonding voters really want. Perhaps they want left-center politics under the mantle of “the right,” as they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can't even identify it). I don't know But I certainly don't belong to such voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advance to the semifinals of the World Championship
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be in Spain aiming for a semi-final start in an afternoon fixing qualifying run.
From a strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek failed, who received a fifty-second penalty for incorrect passing of the goal right at the start of the ride. Přindiš with Prskavec, on the contrary, can rest and focus on Sunday's semi-finals.
“I set out the goal of going down the first drive to 30, which I managed. Not that I don't care how I turned out, because Sunday starts a lot early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position,” said Přindiš, praying himself well-being in Seu. “Before the Patrol Race, I felt my worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then at the race, though, it was good and better today. The whole time here is beautiful, pretty races, the spectators came, so fine,” he smiled.
Sparkavec was also happy. “In qualification, one does not want to make an unnecessary mistake mainly. It didn't quite work for me in the first wickets. Then I took the middle well, without any problems and I knew I had the mover, so the second mistake came when I wanted to drive down right and I turned the erk. Overall I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes on,” said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that on Sunday they would go to the start only at the conclusion of the semifinal block. “I'm not an early bird, it's extra cold after the morning, and when you're here for eighth, it wants to have a jacket and a hoodie,” said Přindiš. “Overall, it takes a semi-final an hour and a half, which makes a pretty good difference in terms of sleep,” agreed Srkavec.
Only Fišerová succeeded from a trio of Czech singcanoists, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. “The upper part I went down to my liking, in the middle passage I found that I was not chased and did not go according to plan, but I was able to get to the comfortable track that I wanted to go. I've done two pokes and I'm just behind the winner by clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals,” said Fišerová.
A gamekeeper injured in a fall from a sitting, carried him to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the summit lots near Čertovo mlýn.
“It was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we went to the injured man five of our rescuers with the proper technique. At the same time, we asked for cooperation with the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then sent an ambulance car to the accident,” Libor Kluz, a dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunters in a pinned location with multiple injuries. They treated it immediately and then sparingly but with difficulty transported on the so-called Austrian wheelchair over unwalkable terrain.
“Transport in the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore surrendered to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours,” added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jashkovsky, the chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and the intervening rescuer, the fellow huntsman fortunately managed to detail the whereabouts of the injured man.
“We therefore found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Ambulance app on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner and at the same time the dispatch line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately,” Radan Jashkovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Ambulance app activated should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Step aside, he challenged Schiller for words about opposition scum Czernin
“I consider it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government anywhere, the less on the floor of parliament, to enjoy such totalitarian expression,” Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words aroused uproar when discussing a draft constitutional action against President Milos Zeman. The opposition didn't get enough votes, and the constitutional action motion the Senate came up with was thrown off the table by MPs.
“I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There isn't a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages of the type of how taxpayer money is being spent here, the empty straw bashing here. And I even take the liberty, I don't use hard expressions, one of them to quote: He's opposition and senatorial scum,” the finance minister said.
“With these terms, Nazis frequent citizens of Jewish origin and communists their political opponents. It is a totalitarian rhetoric, without a modicum of respect for man and opinion,” the deputy chairman of TOP 09 Czernin wrote to the Minister, who will be in the fall for the post of party chairman with the first to date Vice-President Markéta Pekarova Adamová.
“I cited one of the many reports that I received dozens during the course of the House deliberations. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dehonestation that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive behind Thursday's House hearing. The fact that someone refers to themselves surprises me,” Schillerová responded to ČTK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has bitcoins hidden and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It thus responds to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and that the bank then pay suppliers of this oil firms by cryptocurrencies. Staff are also studying a proposal that the central bank can factor cryptocurrencies into foreign exchange reserves, which are now near the lows in 30 years. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has exacerbated the economic crisis in the country even further. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, forcing officials to use a mix of different ways to move money. While Maduro's bid to launch as the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency has failed, continued efforts to harness digital currencies show how desperate the government is trying to find ways by which it would circumvent restriction.
Neither Venezuela's central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value those currencies own. The business is having trouble getting payments from customers through conventional channels because big banks are unwilling to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the firm received most of the $700 million (16.6 billion crore) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions to enable the transaction.
PDVSA may not have the appetite to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because that would require it to register on the exchange and undergo due diligence, so-called due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to entities to whom PDVSA owes. Oil firm officials believe the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could arise in paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized Internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of money laundering and client information problems that go along with them and complicate compliance.
Cryptocurrencies after the 2018 debacle are experiencing a return to the sun this year thanks to the anticipation of their greater adoption by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent over the past four days, but it has nevertheless had a gain of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Heavy competition for Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCEed is betting on lavish gear, at what price?
The Kia XCEed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It falls clearly among compact SUVs, but does not offer all-wheel drive. It leaves this item to the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct answer to cars like the Skoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, XCEed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely remind the world of SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, XCEed can't be included just sideways with the plastic versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so who does not want to see Ceed in shapes novelties may not even have to see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed station wagon, the XCEed also offers itself exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric fourteen. XCEed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged sixteen hundred with 150 kW, reserved for siblings version of the GT. Here sports grade don't wait. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesels are offered only in mild-hybrid design, meaning that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps to reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon the offer will grow with a plug-in hybrid, a variant that will travel about six dozen kilometers on electricity alone. Batteries can then be charged even from a normal outlet.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters were never worn much,” admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in half a year.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
Silver stars then adorned with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has one more catch.
“I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
To date, the most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 kronor.
If the MZ is detached from reality does not even mind much - it will fly out a faulty circuit and replace it with a new one.
The fact is that leaving FB from Europe would greatly help the non-US part of it (the one under the influence is bad luck).
I think that would pretty much clean up the social climate.
Alternatively, the channels of “Soviet fraternal aid” to some of our political parties and representatives would also be better clarified.
Then the people who vote them up would also be more clear about whose interests they really care about.
Too bad he doesn't own TikTok as well.
A lot of teenage people would suddenly find out with great astonishment that even outside the sun was shining...
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a two-match penalty
Sparta has appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letensky club reported on this on its twitter page and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals panel.
Tetteh has already served half of the penalty in Wednesday's domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming for the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to be able to take on Sunday's 11th round tie in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. That's when Olomouc appealed against the penalty for Simon Falta, who on Thursday received a one-match disavowal from the disciplinary committee for exclusion against Liberec.
The appeals panel had not been able to discuss the case, so it delayed the effectiveness of the sentence, and Falta was allowed to mount on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The Commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the next week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian stopped Tetteh's activities for a foul on famer David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The Ghanaian player's alleged spat on rival Tomas Souček's captain has not been proven.

Spilková in the steam room. In Indianapolis, he's at the limit of progress after the first round
Golfer Klára Spilkova is on the edge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship tournament in Indianapolis. She played two birdies, two bogeys on the LPGA Series on Thursday and finished the opening day in par. With a result of 72, he is on the split 69th place, which is the projected cut.
The 24-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and didn't pass in Portland until the second half of the tournament. She indulged in rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after overgoing illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the LET European Series, she is a first-year member of the LPGA Tour and has so far failed to do much. Out of twelve tournaments, she passed the cute three times, best being 32nd in Hawaii. He struggles to keep the card for the next season.
The Indianapolis tournament was played best by Korean Hor Mizhong. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and a lead of two shots ahead of a trio of female opponents.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! In light hair she rejuvenated
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she helped it. She changed her image until her colleagues recognised her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who would have her hair interwoven with grayish paint, wore homesteaded belongings and struck out sporadically into society. She's always looked after herself and the older she gets, the more she can untie herself in looking at her image.
Fortunately, she has not succumbed to the trend of plastic surgeries and is taking care of her skin using good old indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she changed the color of her hair and absolutely peeked through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was still dressed in a yellow coat that shone her even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with looks. And it paid off for Peter, he looks like a maximum of fifty.

On the situation in the US with a leading African-American reporter.
New cases of police violence are coming to light in the United States, this time during crackdowns in nationwide protests.
The demonstrations, which erupted after African-American George Floyd was killed by a police officer in an arrest, have opened a debate about systematic racism, the work of police and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelova speaks to one of the leading African-American journalists, The Atlantic magazine reporter Adam Serwer.
But what would increase that funding?
The union is putting money in subsidies into us.
If he stops doing that, we'll stop having that money.
I really don't see how the union stopping giving us money would cause us to use the money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a whole different discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: there's not just one red
When choosing red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - examine the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are cold type, if into green, then you are among the types of warm. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, put just on the overtone based on the undertone. In the next one, take into account the texture.
If you rank women with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve colors are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertone, choose both such and lipsticks. You can tell them by the fact that they gravitate toward orange, coral, gold or brown flare.
It may happen to you that some veins look green, and others blue. In this case, congratulate yourself - you do not need to look at the undertone, and you can focus only on your color preferences.
Is it even possible for a pub not to siphon taxes?
Is it even possible for a pub to short taxes?
I mean, if a piece of meat goes through a veterinary inspection, it must be registered somewhere, and it can't just get lost anymore, right?
Similarly, Prazdroj and Jelínek probably do not produce special alcohol for the black market.
Still, they often don't give me a receipt somewhere or take it right away and throw it away.

The end of political turmoil? The new law, according to critics, won't help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to make sure ministers are relieved of responsibility for choice while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in tenders for posts in state firms - this is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 MPs pronounced in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, the KSCM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned firms will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation for the minister binding. In the end, that didn't work.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear the nomination bill will be taped to ministers. “The minister will now be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and thus not have clear transparent accountability,” thinks SPD Chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS Vice-President Martin Kupka also speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who will not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free, minimum age of 25 years, and the main selection criterion should also be expertise.
The law will still have to pass the Senate, and then the president will get it for signature.
The government has approved sending up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Sappers, scouts and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states, in connection with the months long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries into its territory with a false promise easy crossing of the Union border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Police union chairman Stepanek has resigned, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Trades Union of Police Milan Štěpánek decided to retire from office. It was stated on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be chairman of the union for two more months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
“I can confirm that this week I handed over my written resignation to the Bureau, after which I will continue to perform the office to the fullest for two months,” Štěpánek told Radiožurnálu. “I decided as a free man who does not want to be forever attached to a trade union. And who wants to live a quieter life,” stated the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security corps or employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security corps. He also got into a dispute with the then interior minister Radek John in 2011, for example, and organised a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
From Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, maybe reality
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed that the Concords flew. “When the Sabre engine is commissioned, it could allow us to reach Australia in around four hours,” Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York, a plane could manage to offend in one hour.
Server Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is five times exceeded, are complicated due to engine overheating. But Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by taking super cold helium, which should prevent temperatures from rising.
“The most important thing about Sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air,” argues Shaun Driscoll of the company Reaction Engines. “Missiles haven't undergone as much development in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft ones have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and you basically create a space plane,” he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to start around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just have a few infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, doctors did not find any “disease states” with the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president at the inspection detected mild signs of dehydration. Its problems with low pressure were caused precisely by inadequate watering. “To fix the dehydration of the body, I will take several infusions that get minerals into my body,” Zeman said.
Otherwise, according to him, the director of the ÚVN stated that “the Czech state has a healthy president”. The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral received several hateful message because of his health inspection.
According to the president, doctors inspected him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. “So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, like it's not a smoker, the liver works like I'm abstinent, the kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on,” stated Zeman.
The iDNES.cz editorial staff contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic primarily at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances in which Zeman has distinct walking problems. According to Prague Castle, the president is walking badly because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and worse to hear. Because of his health, he restricted smoking.
On vacation only with a credit card? NEO account offers ATM withdrawals worldwide for free!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have already become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, security, as well as the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a credit card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. “People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to go to currency exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even “vacationers” don't want to rely on the cash to suffice for them. Moreover, some foreign currencies are not even owned by Czech banks or currency exchange. For the NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs for free, wherever they are,” says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communication and spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
In addition, a credit card is a much more reliable way to not lose your money compared to cash. At the loss of a full wallet, her owner no longer has to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his credit card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via online banking. Thus, when acting quickly, they may not suffer any financial loss at all. “Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages in addition to its reliable protection. For an NEO account, for example, it is interest of 1.6% per annum, which is among the highest among both current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros, and keeping the account is completely free,” adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone about to head abroad, travel insurance should be commonplace. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can also be done at the last minute. However, owning a credit card itself often means insurance protection when travelling. “For example, with embosed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family they are traveling with. Often they do not waste any further arrangements,” adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities that travellers plan to undertake.
Women's basketball players did not achieve the medal of the Under-17 World Cup, finishing fourth
Even the third World Sevens was won by the American women, who beat Spain in the final just 77:75 despite 40 points by Spaniard Angela Salvadoresova.
“We wanted to win a lot and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning, but we could not sustain it because they rolled us under the basket,” regretted captain Karolína Malečková. “But playing in front of such an audience was a surreal experience,” she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8:0 lead thanks to two threes and dominated the entire first quarter on the court. At that point, the opponents seemed to repay the 85:88 base group defeat after extra time. But the referees whistled 15 fouls in half time and helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12:2 string of disputed decisions.
'I'm convinced it was enough to put two more three baskets, run away to 20 points and we wouldn't let go again. But instead came our mistakes. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent get caught,” said coach Richard Fousek.
“It wasn't the first time we had a blackout in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything out and they fought to the end. But the opponent was a lot of quality,” he added.
In particular, the Czech kept Petr Holešínská in the game with accurate shooting from distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. The Czech top scorer, however, had a problem with fouls and missed much of the third quarter on the court. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they had already maintained, even though the Czechs struggled until the last seconds.
“For us the first five games were a lot of challenging, we rotated matches in close rotation and it cost us a lot of power. Already against Spain you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of the physics, we weren't consistent in defence. We didn't play a quick counterattack, we lacked the rebounding. And the Hungarians are of such high quality that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win,” added Fousek.
He believes his fiduciary awaits a promising future. “In two years the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European Championships to 16-year-olds and now they are fourth in the world. To our circumstances, it is a quality team with good character and need to work with it further and develop talent. Now it's up to the federation, which coach they assign in higher categories,” added Fousek.
The Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is looking into another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov primary school is not proven,” Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the county in the week.
“We continue to wait for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases — it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Nonspray Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” she said headmistress.
She added that they are two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four have a symptomless course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron travelled abroad
None of those listed have travelled abroad, nor has any of their families, nor has there been contact with anyone residing abroad.
The connection with the water polo championship is none of those listed, Ciupek said.
Pavla Svrčinová, the chief hygienist, said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was being checked.
Players from South Africa were also on it, and one Belgian player fell ill upon his return.
California will limit gun sales.
He wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state with the help of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its a controversial law against abortion performed after embryo heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation when suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's opinion by the US supreme court that left the Texas abortion ban in place, even if it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US at roughly 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court now ruled not on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Indeed, enforcement of the ban was delegated to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial route.
“I am outraged by yesterday (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which authorized the retention of Texas's ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver with aim to protect his law,” the California governor stated.
“If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work, in conjunction with the state parliament and the justice minister, on a measure that would entitle representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made guns that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to require at least $10,000 (over $220,000) in compensation and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell in California assault rifles, components to “ghost weapons” or kits for their manufacture.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do,” the California governor stated.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some Army-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state now actually reinstates the ban using a Texas template, the words of liberal supreme court member Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on Friday would be confirmed The majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
Nonetheless, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas's abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against select officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where we gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect mentioned by you.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule over time, only it's too soon for that time.
Another fact is that in not long a new vaccine should come to the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x more efficiency.
The amount of curriculum calmly leave.
But rethink the CO is learning.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology has progressed a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into workbooks doesn't make much sense anymore, and it's a waste of time.
These things could be really brutally taken away.
On the other hand, how many people drop out of elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And the other things he will necessarily need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and I pay myself a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, the latter does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to halt payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in breach of law if it used the new powers and halted the payment of money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU fund to rebuild economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should answer this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes it would the current government lost its tight majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from a common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes undergone by the Polish justice under Ziobrova's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is constructing “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces “political diktat carried out by blackmail and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on the government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic by control.
He said his party would never accede to such concessions to Brussels, which would see Poland's sovereignty curtailed.
“We will never agree to Poland having colony status,” he declared.
Under the bridge, someone killed a non-conflicted homeless woman. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder occurred sometime during the early evening to the night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
“One of the drivers who passed on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the street Pod Krejcárkem could have filmed the killer, for example, on a dashboard camera. Some witness might have just seen him and could describe him. In short, we will welcome any testimony on this case and accept it on line 158,” said Jan Daněk, a spokesman for the Regional Directorate of Police.
According to a spokesman for Daňek, the homeless murdered woman was non-conflicted, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. A woman lived at the scene. “Most often she moved around Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had big blue shopping bags,” added Daněk's description of the victim, which could also help possible witnesses.

Mahulena Bočanova has interrupted the annual detox and sins again!
A little more than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Blesko that she had cut off alcohol. “During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my old ruined 50-year-old body a breath. I gave myself a deadline of forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. I haven't been doing well mentally lately. I get up better, my head doesn't hurt, I have more energy, money.”
A year's abstinence was said to have been enough, and the actress once again found her way to alcohol. “Occasionally I'll have bubbly or fine wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun till morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for maybe a week. I also saved non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time,” boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno entrepreneur Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will now join the series Ordination in the Rose Garden. “I'm ashamed for the first two shows, I was really bad, I was misspelling. But it's getting better,” the actress smiles critically.
But to confess it... At our place in Lidl they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for the other things, I met one yogurt more than once, all I needed was cheese, parmesan cheese, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's an evasion, I don't even smelt into any market anymore, non-action action, gold shop in the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.

And I don't care anymore.
For two years watching data being treated here like manure, most vaccination opponents are just a little more out of the bowl than most vaccination advocates.
Rational discussion is taking place at expert level, but only extreme views reach the public space.
Constantly wall-to-wall.
Binary considered: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states no one addresses.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon in my childhood.
It was never due to grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (read instead of going to bed, fighting my bro etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next “catching” of the cooktop only brought and laid so that I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I received a few bum blows (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child reacts to them far more than they do to words.
What's important, I think, is the part with the warning, because it gives the child, in a way, the choice of disobeying and getting, or getting better and the punishment won't.
In the end, most of the time all it took was a warning to start listening
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, public piety will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died Thursday at 86, will take place Monday night at Paris's Montparnasse cemetery. French media report on this, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a piety in Paris Invalides, where a coffin containing Chirac's remains will be on display, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been streaming into the presidential mansion since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign into a condolence book. That will be possible until Sunday. Then, for Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared state mourning.
Meanwhile, more reactions are coming from the world and France to the deaths of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, who is now described by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe as “the Frenchman in the right sense of the word”.
Chiraca was commemorated by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumó. The news of the former French president's death appeared on the front pages of all Japanese dailies, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The tribal art museum on Paris' Quai Branly Avenue, which Chirac founded, will not collect admission fees for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
Defense of the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic inquiry in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him — whether the sacred charter to which he is sworn and about which from teaching at school or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely lean to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens and, with changes, are better to conserve them.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have predicted, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be premeditated.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have met across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set politicians with the mantinels of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind policies with bans.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to give their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fighting for life of several months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with lately.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” the chief of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Faculty told News Brno Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The course is considerably simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which is what we see especially in the last period,” added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
The latter takes place in the clinic of pediatric infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are up to the ARU recently.
Children with postcovid syndromes were continuously in the department according to the doctor throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease strikes next to adults as adolescents , as well as several months-long babies.
In hospitals there are even children in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“At present, a child of several months and adolescent age lies with us,” the chief mayor said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded at the Children's Hospital FN Brno so far from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years occurred in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in the children's hospital — not just the coronavirus ward — an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“Therefore, the application of the vaccination dose is also recommended in children,” the doctor added.
New Tube architect overlooks line D, brings experience of London Underground
The Prague Transport Company chose an architect to oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. From October Anna Švarc will become her primary task, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the subway is not only seen as a transport construction, underground travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
A Czech architect who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender for the Prague Transport Enterprise (DPP).
In addition to it, 14 other bidders participated in the Tender. “Included in the selection process was a cover letter and a CV. Probably decided by my previous practice from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the metro in a team of three people,” says the new metro architect. Likewise, according to her, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the City of Prague could also decide.
Metro doesn't just perceive as a traffic fuknary construction. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
“I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve, I have. However, I will only know how this is going to happen in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to my ideas,” says Švarc.
“This is not a series of dogmas, but rather a recommendation designed primarily to maintain the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed,” the design manual approaches.
Whether a similar tool is also a way for improving public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. “Whether the manual is ideal or whether it can cover some personality, I really do not know yet,” Švarc concludes.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But those rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally in national parks outside the rest zone you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the fields).
Skiing/cycling in the woods outside marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it's not so much guarded outside national parks).

China builds impression of managed contagion and that authoritarian regime faces crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime faces a crisis better.
China has gone on both medical and political offensives.
A couple of months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increment of infected.
Countries including the Czech Republic compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, such as in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC station, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters reported, citing the police commissioner, that there were over three hundred children from five years old above. Some were shackled with chains to each other, others were chained to iron circles in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC the raid at the school was carried out on the basis of giving. He called the school a house of horror. Starved people were kept there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him it is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubua Saboa, a teacher there.
The children told police they were taken to school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. “We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north,” a Sabo spokesman said on the identities of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal School posed as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freed were taken to a stadium where aid and food are provided to them. Some have already met relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts banks provide free of charge. However, the offer should be considered because some other services for accounts are already charged. “The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management tends to be free is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the forgiven fees to be returned to them someday. There is probably no mistake about the small migration of Czechs between banks,” says Kristýna Kuncová from DTest.
“Small bills,” according to her, can do almost everything that adult accounts. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, track movements on the account, somewhere has his own electronic banking available. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to handle them and also control their payments.
“Quite flexibly, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, etc. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking through the Internet or through information SMS. Attention, these may no longer be free,” adds Kuncová, adding: “If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider his abilities and options.”
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) does not take any questions. On his Call and Write Boss show, he publicly comments on a variety of topics. And he is no stranger to the tabloid caucuses that he sparkly and humorously glosses. Although this time he wasn't into laughter.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news of Karel Gott's very serious illness. He promised the singer one very thoughtful thing for himself.
“You know, Karel got sick and said it fair, without the tabloid journalists having to poke it somewhere. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all appreciate Karl Gott immensely. And I wish him, of course, successful treatment and, most importantly, peace of mind! The calm he needs now,” said TV owner Barrandov.
“I wish the media would leave him alone. And she waited for the news that the Master himself decides to provide to the media. I don't even like the different expressions that all his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health status. And for our media I can say that we will attend to his illness and his person only if he shows interest in it himself. I think other media should consider a similar approach.”
The pair wrapped the female with tape and drowned in the river, the sack was found by the children
The case took place in late July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old that she wanted to look after. But her ten years older partner didn't like the fact that she was a female, so he decided to get rid of her.
“He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope, greatly eliminating his vocal speech. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he obliged. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment they threw the dog into the water, the dog was demonstrably living,” said Zlin police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, children playing by the river found a jute sac on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They therefore called out to the woman who was walking by and ran away. The woman announced the event to police emergency call hotline 158.
“The police officers, thanks to the knowledge of the inhabitants of the small town, have found out who is likely the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and woman confessed to the act and described how the event took place,” a police spokeswoman added.
Experts from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a uniquely harrowing manner as a result of suffocation, when before death the animal suffered in the order of several minutes.
“The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly indicate a clear intention to dispose of the animal at all costs in this repudiate way, even if they may have donated or sold the dog. The Commissioner of the Criminal Police from Zlín accused the pair of committing an animal cruelty offence committed in an accessory. The two not yet convicted could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted,” noted Kozumplíková.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were travelling on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). “The plane at half past nine in the evening sought permission to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatov,” police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said. This was also the last record, at which time it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov according to GPS coordinates.
But it didn't fly to Klatovy airport anymore. The search began immediately for the lost aircraft, which sent a distress signal. “He engaged, besides the police, as well as a military helicopter,” police spokeswoman Martina Korandova said. But the search action didn't have a happy ending.
A helicopter crew noticed wreckage in the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane was last caught in the morning. “We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life,” Korand confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches, pieces hitting the ground nearby as well. “We will determine the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for Expert Determination of the Causes of Air Accidents,” Korandová added.
The planet's fastest man missed tests. I don't take anything, fight back
The traditionally much-watched duel for the planet's fastest man will be the hunt for defending silver champion Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the world tables leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. But his start at the top of the season was jeopardized due to a case with missed doping exams.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without pressing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not take three doping exams last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first wrongdoing was dated back by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to 1 April 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but he missed the test on 6 June. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit wrongdoing in the form of three unconducted checks within 12 months.
Coleman defended himself that he merely forgot to update the in-app data on the whereabouts of athletes. “I don't do drugs, nor do I take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard, and that's what it's about,” he declared before the start of MS.
He suffered his only defeat from six starts this year at a hundred as he entered the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was outscored by just six thousandths of a second by compatriot Noah Lyles. The latter used Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run a two-hundred at Worlds.
Paper's second fastest competitor with 9.86 performance is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has done well so far only at American university competitions.
Defending the title will already be seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb but only for 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
The circuit's favourites also include South African Akani Simbine, three-time Rio Olympic medallist Andre de Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican, with a time of 9.96, is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's hundred will start the pre-round and run-ins on Friday. Semi-finals and finals are on the agenda on Saturday. Medals will be run at 21:15 CEST (UTC+2).
He meets a friend of a friend and says to him: hey don't you want an elephant?
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because he grasses the grass, the car washes with his trunk, the children play with him.
Well, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: Okay, let's slap, that's gonna be great...
After some time, they meet and the guy who bought complains: you dude who sold that for an elephant????
Lawn unraveled, giant poop everywhere, car unraveled, kids fight him and wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold says, you're talking about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic builds an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few know that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad study in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. Pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, tried to get some of them.
In order to arrive at the Motol Hospital in Prague around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Tara Hussein Tayeb had to bring up a lot. The Kurdish with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleymaniya, a town in the northeast of Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon she still treats small patients within the framework of private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
World events are controlled by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the superpowers that set the course for international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
The latter works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be 10 or 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will lead.

It struck me too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'll have a word.
I'm just proceeding from the fact that the ellipsis mostly involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and tangerines”, when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas “Spanish fruit and mandarin” is no longer clear in tangerines, that they're from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads “all US forces” thus including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So, in other words, I expect that this is already covered in that broad term and there is no need to specify it further with US forces.
But again, maybe just a word of words:D
Either way, it's a meaningless requirement
A five-degree earthquake has been recorded in Tokyo.
A 5.0-magnitude earthquake struck Japan's capital Tokyo and surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were rumbling in the capital, but no damage has yet been reported.
Nor has a tsunami warning been issued, Reuters reported.
Britain's Vicki Holland tortured cosman monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed it off.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebab and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her mistreatment said they had never seen such a frightened cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now contentedly playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence at Gwent Magistrates' Court, with a suspended suspension of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay in recalculation 12,000 kroner court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further. “
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement prompted her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new humans can still create panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered terrifying footage in the woman's phone following a raid at her flat over drug allegations.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: “Do you want cocaine? “
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for £1600 (recalculated less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you take away the same things you did in 6th grade freshman year?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling, where no one, honor to exceptions, cares if you know or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and on the street randomly ask people if they master to determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cross and tell you they're totally in the throes.
So what the hell are they learning for?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't have a need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Partly it's learning for that lot of people who need that thing is going to need.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this while standing by the machine, I was totally serious... because you just don't need to.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(In which our communist past is probably involved in our country, and against the educators and elites) However, the cost of having these machines cost us barbarians is simply high.
If journalists could count, then covid probably never reached these proportions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to quit all contact and even block it on social networks.
It has been creaky between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to see her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused to do so.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect to hate.
It was a planned attack from you! became incensed by Kadri's turnover in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gamblering and debts.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now-ex-wife did not appeal to his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly represent her brother.
Normally I don't comment on this sort of thing at all, and even in the family we never said much extra these things to each other.
I don't want to induce any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I like so much, they just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to thank my brother Qadri publicly for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we do the most needed even though, at how young an age he was.
It saddens me all the more when I have to read such false information, which is probably pretty taken out of context.
I really wish everyone knew Qadri as I, our loved ones and family stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added indefinitely.
A drunken burglar climbed down the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe for what.
His robbery quest was launched by Cao in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle in the recalculation.
After that, he could think of nothing better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene and eating a banana in the process.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The latter subsequently detained Cao Cao.
A man has confessed to drinking something alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, while drunk, he decided to plunder.

When that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law admittedly limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?

Over 60 per cent of voters came to the four municipalities elections on Saturday
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišťsko region, Lusatia na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberec and in Rovna na Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councillors broke up there.
There were 99 candidates running for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held a total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially very monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Deputy President of the CSO Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, elections were more demanding on equipment as well as staffing.
In Komni na Uherskohradišťsk, Saturday's election was won by the Independent Candidates Association, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council; 18.52 percent of the electorate gave them their vote.
The former mayor of the village Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, joined the council again.
One mandate in the council was achieved by the Komňans — independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the urns.
In the village Rovná na Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, meaning four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Independent Candidates Association 1 and one from the Independent Candidates Association 2 joined the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lusatia na Mosteck were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, so has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second was the candidate Municipality for the People, who gave the vote to 43.27 percent of the electorate, so there will be three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the urns.
The election in Nová Ves in Liberec was won by independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of the electorate voted for the Independent Candidates Association and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO got 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the 2018 regular election, gained more by mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
The State Election Commission will discuss the results of the election on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
Epilepsy has complicated his love of sport, he has new hope thanks to surgery
For the first time, Honzik's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into the space for a few minutes, immobilized and did not react to anyone. Therefore, the pediatrician sent him to the Children's Neurological Clinic, where doctors, after a series of examinations, made him a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately put him on medications, but they did not work immediately.
Almost a year it took for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors dropped his medication, and since the seizures did not return, his parents considered that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more towards sports. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. At eleven years old, he got another seizure and everything started over again.
Doctors again tried various combinations of drugs, but this time nothing was working anymore, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since during a seizure Honza always stopped perceiving, his parents were suffering with horror that he would get him during sports and get hurt. Gradually Honza stopped cycling and switched downhill skis for cross-country skiing and snowboard. Although the sport gave him a seizure from time to time, he never completely gave it up. He even fulfilled a dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who always had it in her sight to help in case of emergency.
When Honz was 15 years old, his parents decided to try changing doctors and turned to experts in the FN in Motol. After a series of examinations, the doctors there considered that Honza was a candidate for surgery, which removes a bearing from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. “I had to do 2 operations in a row, first the doctors injected probes into my brain to scan its activity, then they could remove my bearing. It's been a few weeks' hell for me. All I had to do was lie down and almost not move, there were wires sticking out of my head that were connected to the computer,” recalls Honza.
Surgery was successful and doctors removed quite extensive bearing. “The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Compared to how vibrant and communicative he normally is, it was a scary change, but luckily after a couple of days everything returned to normal,” my mum describes, adding: “A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors, it happens. Since then, he's been seizure-free for 3 months.”
This school year Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and started cooperating with Company E, with which he goes around schools to talk about epilepsy. Honza is not fully engaged in sports activities yet, he begins to return to the sport in a gradual way. “I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so as not to expose the body to sudden stress, which is pretty nuts with my competitive nature,” explains Honza.
Accordingly, this year will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, which takes place already this weekend 28 September 2019 at Veselská sandpit. But next year, hopefully it will.
What do you think would be the bigger deal?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing fool so you have someone to “argue” with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not arguing that Christians are degenerates, nor do anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it was replacing, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the 30 year old
tl; dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together
Download free Metro 2033 Redux and Everything on PC, time you have until Thursday
A link to both games is on the Epic Store here. You can also include games in your library directly via the web, but you need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play. You have until October 3.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original 2010 game, adding both graphical and gameplay changes from the sequel Last Light.
The story on the motives of the book of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky takes place in 2033 in Russia after a nuclear war. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity had to take refuge under the ground, in our case to the vast complexes of the Moscow metro.
“Take the post-apocalyptic world and oppressive atmosphere from an unfamiliar environment, take on the vastness of the world and add lots of spectacular scripts and action passages and tradals: Metro 2033 is on world,” we wrote on Bonusweb in a period review.
Everything, by contrast, is a relaxing game-non-game in a procedurally generated world that carries the message of English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. The player can become anything, from animals to trees to the planet.

A French chef is in court with Michelin over the removal of a star. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after acquiring it. He intends to court with the publisher of the red guide to receive the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also doubts the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who he believes mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Upper Savoy Alpine region lost one in three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be judged because the commissioners' conclusion, according to him, was not properly justified. In addition, the removal of the star according to it occurred without any notice. “I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you mess with the health of chefs?” Mailed Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have provided the chef with only vague reasons, such as that the chef had put cheddar in a souffle, which did not appeal to the inspection. “I put saffron in it and those gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I have been working with Savoy ingredients with love since the beginning,” he countered Veyrat's decision. The latter is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: “You are fraudsters who only stir up controversy for commercial reasons.” An indignant Veyrat does not understand “how they could afford to say we put cheddar in our soufflé”. “They also offended our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning,” he blustered.
The distinctive chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore calls for the removal of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher rejects this. “If the business remains open and our inspectors reselect it, we will continue to recommend it,” argues Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies that he has no meaningful allegations yet, and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. “We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will examine his comments carefully,” he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
The man fell head down from twelve metres.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was interfered by paramedics of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
County operations centre workers took over an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews — medical and medical — immediately went to the site.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that a 27-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and hit the concrete with his head!
It caught coal in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of emergency service teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger to life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further precautions under pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance vehicle transported him to further care Ostrava Traumatology Centre, informed the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned than the coronavirus about inadequate responses from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are on the front line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever disease from a mosquito on its territory. It's related to climate change
Mosquitoes, in addition to West Nile fever, can also transmit malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a man becoming infected with West Nile fever in German territory after being pinched by an infected mosquito. The DPA reported on this. Until now, all those sick have contracted the virus while traveling or by contact with sick animals. According to experts, the groundbreaking case of the disease is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a 70-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. The disease had a severe course and due to inflammation of the brain he was treated in a hospital in Leipzig. He is now healthy.
West Nile fever virus was first demonstrated in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it spread to vast swathes of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s, to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and also mosquitoes that become infected with their infected blood.
Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended belt
MMA has had a great gala full of interesting results.
There were things going on at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peñova was able to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at light-heavyweight, performing a great stranglehold against Dustin Poirier and defending the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept away Cody Garbrandt with a first-round technical KO.
He also defeated his opponent by Sean O'Malley.
Surprises like no one expected.
This brought a women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle with each other as an imaginary “dwarf,” Nunes did not lose for seven years and grinded her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her way to win a lot actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, sending her to the ground.
However, Peñová did not allow herself to be forced into any further error and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack using a lever on her arm.
The second round was riveting and very thrilling for MMA fans.
Both female opponents conceived themselves with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Peñova, moreover, got Nunes to the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and knock off the effort.
Thus, the American woman prepared everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the light-heavyweight title.
At first Poirier fared better, however, the card gradually began to turn around.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his arm.
Although he did not succeed, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a number of wounds.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock off the stranglehold.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, lost after two years.
In the next bout, he scored sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right-back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
He subsequently conquered it with a series of precisely aimed blows, scoring his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most of the nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is masculine, feminine or medium.
Then there is also a fairly numerous group of nouns for which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
In inflection, they then take on dual endings and in some cases remain in a non-sloping form.
For example, the words “writhing” or “hip” are both male and female, in the former they are folded according to the pattern “machine”, in the second according to the pattern “song”.
For the next group of nouns, different forms are already in the first fall of the singular, such as: “row/row”, “khlrabi/khlrabna” or “potato/potato” (meaning foodstuff).
Both shapes are standard, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as “cucumber” in Bohemia and “curek” in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian a pair of words: “trench” and “trench”, “donut” and “donut”, etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally non-inclined, but they gradually take over Czech endings.
Typical examples are the term “image”, which is both male and female, or the word “buffet”, which remained unbowed in the middle family, but in male it has endings according to the pattern “castle”.
Civilization in lent time
Recently I remembered a beautiful “buzz” from one of the great short stories of Šimek with Grossmann set partly in the cemetery, which reads like this: “I warned her that she was crying well, but on a stranger's grave!” It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They act as if the planet Earth is ruled by humans. In fact, we are just a speck on her surface, which she can blow out with her herbnac powers like a fierce whiff of wind the flame of a candle. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American natural history documents dealing with the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for some of the larger active volcanoes to get “screwed” properly, and our advanced civilization will sink out of it.
And that it will happen in the immediate future is highly likely. Many large volcanoes have, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, “charged and unlocked” (such as Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal for the eruption, if it must happen once, to occur as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are dumped utterly needlessly on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production because any properly angry volcano gets it along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases can emit at least 100 times more into the air than was saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
So forcibly limiting CO2 production doesn't make any sense. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that with a significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, any potential warming is considerably more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of an ice age would be.
If we realize the still under-researched effect of solar cycles on Earth's climate, we must only come to a reasonable conclusion: Let's try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and To other changes with which we cannot measure with force, let us try to adapt with the least possible cost!

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
Tensions are running rampant on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants attempting to get farther into Europe.
Thousands of people began making their way to the southern border of the Schengen zone after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians pledge support to Greece, humanitarian aid is also being forthcoming by the Czech government.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Coal will give way to both gas and core. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says head of Europe's ExxonMobile
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the inappropriate climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the US concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil miners, argues so. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories in which unconsumed energy could be stored later from days when the sun and wind are enough are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobile centre in Prague, where 1200 people work and whose task is to support the business activities of the company and provide logistics and other services needed for functioning of the company.
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we choked, describes a Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, which Australia is dealing with for the fourth straight month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the residents themselves deal with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have been doing more to forestall the drastic fallout, critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelova speaks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations always have been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written everywhere.
People find it awkward to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how horribly widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how people are often treated by their surroundings or the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgust and spat in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “much of the accusation is fictional” and that it's a “trend” you're only helping sexual abusers.
Soldiers rehearse, pull back the curtains. China snubs celebrations at massacre site
The army rehearsed the show during recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to pull their curtains. Along the emptied streets, military vehicles rolled toward the square and combat aircraft circled in the sky.
Several Chinese have told Reuters that they are proud their country will show off its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that celebrations would unsettle other states.
She was apparently alluding to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are imminent. But they may also have concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against China's attainted caretaker.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen had already performed a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies opposite insular Taiwan and is among China's ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things is growing. It already has drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves on it, The Guardian newspaper has warned. He added that China's popular social network Weibo was erasing “harmful political information.”
“This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all predictions,” said historian Maura Cunningham, who covers China. “It is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power,” she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists led by Mao Zedong won a fight with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists who had retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy protesters from among students and workers alike with tanks in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken on elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of both communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Czechia flooding houses under construction, families have no money to finish
Prices for building material have risen more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been put in an awkward situation because of this.
She does not have the resources to complete the houses under construction and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people don't have enough money to complete family homes already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage lending to them, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to unbuilt and uncollapsed houses.
Worse case scenario, houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent to do so,” says BHS economist Štěpán Kastecek.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of this has happened to us.
It's hard for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contracted, even though the material has gotten more healthy.
So we do without earnings,” said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on building a house to work out to five million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some will be waitin',” added Slivoň.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment are the most undercut.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates from construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
More favorable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit.
“Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Hamster specified.
We're doing well and we're going to do even better.
But real visions are missing, says the commentator of the CRO — Mujrozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entrance to the New Year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, in addition to the prime minister and president of ANO, President Miloš Zeman and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Senate and the House of Representatives spoke to the nation.
What fundamental did we learn?
Meal package is planned by the Ministry from 2021. Tax-wise nothing changes
The MF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the MF, a quarter of employees reach the support of catering, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers.
According to David Rýc, chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, however, many small companies, which do not have a canteen or meal vouchers, provide catering to their employees, for example by import food or by agreement with restaurants.
“The essence of intent is that we don't change anything about the tax benefit. Further, it will not be paid for health and social insurance,” Schiller said on Friday. She added that the threshold for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows firms to reimburse a maximum of 55 percent of the price of a meal vouchers. The remaining part of the employee is paid, in some cases they are also paid by the employer, but no longer without a tax credit. The most favorable value of meal vouchers for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
As in, I find my diploma super right now, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's, I always work on it all year, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The stateswoman are completely at peace with us, unless a man is a total macaque and there is something left in his head, then the committee will not unnecessarily stifle him on the theory.
For example, I studied at the stateswoman for a week and when I was in the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical inference, which immediately came to my mind and I had it right.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do that semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they have caged.
To me, it's cool if at the end of the subject there is an exam that translates the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
The car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post server by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative afterlight, it says that the medical community has ignored the facts of obesity for decades and waged a fierce (and also pointless) war against overweight people, which not only does not remarked on public opinion, but also ruined a lot of lives. Now, however, is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes puts right at the beginning is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing and knowing the facts to putting it into practice. It mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew, believing that they would prevent diseases. However, the British wartime navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into view. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they began to be mandatory only in the 1960s, likewise the first confirmed death in connection with asbestos dates back to 1906, yet its the first ban came in 1973.
'Every public health discovery - and it doesn't matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial stimulus within the society into which it was supposed to be implemented ,” writes Hobbes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children now meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Meanwhile, obesity is viewed as the highly-personal failure of the individual, which is claimed to be straining health care and reducing GDP. The fear of thickness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they put out on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets do not work. As far back as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Personal meets systemic, where, for example, at faculties, when teaching future doctors, only 19 hours from the whole study are devoted to nutrition issues. Which at a time when the 60 calorie process that Americans take in comes from ultra-processed food — that is, overly processed food.
How obesity is stigmatised, in turn, is illustrated by reports from offices where overweight people typically experience shorter checkups, doctors approach them with less empathy and view them as more problematic patients.
But being overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, Since 1980, the proportion of obesity in 73 countries has doubled and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop the surge. Totally none.
All right, but don't get overwhelmed by emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as them.
Those people at the embassy might have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you might as well put up a similar statue of Putin next to the Winnie the Pooh statue.
You should still give it to put Xi Jinping on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing performers sticks under their feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
Plus they keep changing what feature is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been shitting me off lately, so I might have to cut back to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my business have success and can't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might even like it if something user-friendly came along that doesn't suck all creativity and energy from artists
Statement from Workers' Party in Donbasa
The union — yes, breaking — no, the opponents of breaking the USSR express their opinion in the slide.
Thirty years since the unlawful breaking of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Běominz forest on December 8, 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violations of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with open by the lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, they signed an agreement that “The SSR Union as a subject of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With one cut of the pen, they “abolished” a huge country with a population of nearly three hundred million.
With the breakup of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even regardless of the loss of non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Běominh forest, destroyed what had been built for the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put the brakes on agriculture, seceded from the world's greatest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poorer of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, a series of Orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria — all the result of geopolitical surrender, surrender first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a notion in political science as a “vacuum of force.”
Everything that was betrayed and given up in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that had accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken up to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident on D5: Freeway shut down by truck collision
The event was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. “The motorway is closed, at least to freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through the gas station,” police spokeswoman Michaela Richter said in the morning. Traffic managed to resume around 2:30 p.m. The preliminary damage is at least two million crowns according to Richter, the cause of the accident officers are investigating.
Central Bohemian firefighters spokesman Petr Svoboda said that one truck was carrying passenger vehicles and the other plastic granulate. “Due to the large impact, there was a displacement of the vehicles transported which firefighters first had to secure against any potential fall,” he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 litres of diesel leaked. Another 200 litres firefighters managed to siphon off. Workers of the environment department of Beroun City Hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The discharge of the crashed vehicles and the clearance of the highway was provided by a private firm, which also extracted the contaminated earth.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it with putting it in the fridge and making it a Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will make it cheap to 99 CZK/kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat by changing its price becomes a liability for my digestive system?
Or I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 CZK/kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday about 120 CZK and left it for 3 days in your fridge?
I will answer myself - I do nothing.
This crap about the fact that when something is cheap it must be guaranteed bad, spoiled or poor quality is horribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Germans elected Keller to head football union
Bundesliga Freiburg boss Fritz Keller has become the new chairman of the German Football Association, as expected. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronomer and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years; he did not have an opposing candidate.
As Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who stepped down in April over an affair with unacknowledged income. His other predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach will in turn go on trial over possible bribery in the assignment of the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to return confidence to the union and drive it out of the crisis. “It will be no One Man Show, many people will bear responsibility. The union is better than its reputation,” said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After his election as head of the union Keller left his office in Freiburg.
The Děchina Zoo rejoices at the little macaque
“Our group currently has seven members. Her youngest member came into the world on 17 August, was given birth to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father being the male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed against her body and for a long time did not want to show the world if she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, the cub has already started to postpone him gradually for a little while and the carers have known for a few days that it is a male,” said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, saying that The Děchina Zoo has successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Csted macaques are so-called endemities of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live elsewhere in the world in the wild. A typical feature is black fur and a crest on the head, according to which they have a name. Csted macaques live in rainforests, primarily at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on both plant and animal food. In the diet, the fruits of forest trees predominate very significantly, which complement the flowers and leaves. He addresses the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
“If we do not miss the natural enemies that are pythons, everything else is written down on his notch again by man. Locals hunt macaques as popular prey with tasty meat and for fur. Burning and cutting down the rainforest is fatal for these animals,” added the spokeswoman.

Přerov: Driver crashed near village Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a flat section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old chauffeur of the fabie couldn't handle driving here and went off the road. The car flipped onto its roof and he was left wedged underneath. He did not survive the injuries sustained.
'According to initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of the Kokory came out of communication, where it flipped onto its roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle, 'she said Přerov police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová for the server novinky.cz.
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies gave out some pamphlet, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it out...
Well, the pamphlet was full of sanity and conservative views of the workings of the world, but nowhere about god, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some such agitka.
After reading it, I found who was publishing it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good stuff, full of useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pig.
Pity the paper, because of this the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love him without realizing how much in the p*deli the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk out.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
After that, she began physically blocking the door.
It was a cool relationship for about a year but then another half year went by and started to get her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship with I told her from I was breaking up and luring her but we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch some amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurers are frantically shattering here by buying a cloud of tests and hounding for positives who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees in the random number generator falling five days of house arrest.
In the west, they stopped with the crenchery, acknowledging that there was no value in tackling a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the war is new and he has to cut some more and drive his ego by making up a faggot.
I see the good old scumbag is coming back to us again.
After several years of downplaying and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelance again.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at the matriculated school), initial promises about training products and business skills quickly flipped into “you don't need to be interested, especially get people”.
I was sincerely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to frighten and talk a person.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to find a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earners, or then one felt like a peddling pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, a person learned not to jump on every spit right away and scrutinise the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in one bag.
People are successful in this business and even people benefit, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or “fat” account.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for themselves! Says Andor Shándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakub. The media speculated in the week that the army planned its final farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence despite the family's wishes as bombastic as only soldiers can. There were inconsistencies about the date of the burial as well. Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
“It's rubbish! We have been in contact with the family since the beginning, the arranged Friday funeral date has been valid since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like military honors pay. Only we will deal with possible media participation with regard to the family,” Pejšek told Blesku on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place really on Friday and there will be no shortage of military honors including the flight of fighter jets.
There is still a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The memorial ceremony will not be attended by the organizers who have worked with the general in the past!
It is, for example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakub 17 years ago. Shándor remembers a former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and a “good guy.”
In addition, he has regularly met him in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Military Intelligence. Which is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. “I personally would have gone to Milan Jakub's funeral,” said Blesku Šándor. But he can't.
“I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think it's not right to privatize a funeral in this way,” said the security expert. It does not play him or the reportedly considered closing the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of the Army's top brass.
“The leadership of the army is not classified, and the leaders of the military intelligence are not either, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media's information is true, and the family has indeed been left behind by the military, that is of course the family's business. Personally, I would never allow the army to roll over the family and their wishes,” concluded Shándor.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Spindleruv Mlyn in a car accident. Milan Rapid's head-on clash with Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sport car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur bend racer should have driven into the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the clash. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that he will carry the consequences for the rest of his life. Police interviewed the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Czechs or children entrance forbidden. CTI exposed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinforming prices and non-compliance with the principles of honesty sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to enter smaller children. On its website, according to the CTI, it writes that the facility is not suitable for children aged under eight years old. “When asked electronically by the consumer whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four years in that restaurant, an employee of the restaurant replied electronically that in the restaurant do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight,” added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while it allowed English speakers to do so. “Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of a consumer, were not allowed to sit down at the table and make an order in the restaurant. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this,” a spokesperson for the CTI described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they are not yet terminated, the spokesman of the inspection could not provide more information about the mentioned restaurants.
But discrimination only emerged for a very small proportion of restaurants controlled in the second quarter. In total, the CTOI carried out 139 checks. In addition to the two cases of discrimination referred to, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. Mostly these were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of honesty of sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged sums higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines have already fallen 60,000 crowns.
In the corporate where I do, I haven't experienced much of that sort of thing.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management, and they don't put our noses in anything.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form of what it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what is not) - it is more of a self-assessment than that someone would rate you by some numbers, and stuff like that.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments what are more “corporate”.
Sometimes one feels like we are such a skoro-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't annoy us much as long as the results are.

In four municipalities, new councilors at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, a new council was elected in the municipalities of Komňa na Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice na Mosteck, Nová Ves na Liberec and Rovovna na Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councillors broke up there.
There were 99 valid candidates running for 28 mandates in the new election.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
They registered the highest interest in Rovná municipality, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and especially highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more severe epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President Czech Statistical Office.
The last voting precinct was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hrs.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Elections Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection
Whatever fans are positive, he wishes Hasek. Sparta awaits a splágr in Pilsen
'We will play to the limit of possibility, we will do everything we can to succeed. In order to manage the game in game and score,” promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview with club television.
In the week the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She's relieved, but she continues to worry about the game room.
Even though the season slowly spills over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the end of his engagement.
“But it's still Sparta, which has very quality players. A complex match awaits us,” warns Pilsner Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy orchards for the last time, in mid-May it was an unequivocal matter in the superstructure. The guests departed after a mindless performance with a 0:4 thrashing, the largest in the history of the separate Czech league.
While back then the difference between the clubs in the table was eight-point before the match, now Sparta loses nine points after ten games of the new season. He's experiencing one of the worst season entries ever.
“It is not an easy situation either for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different than it currently is,” Hasek feels. “But we would have liked them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."”
Sparta does not know if in Pilsen will be able to use Tetteh, who, although he received a two-match penalty for exclusion in Pilsen, appealed against him on Friday.
The numerous marauders remain Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen from 2011.
Home, who have won their last five games including Wednesday's Cup in Hlučín, should only meet midfielder Čermák. And as captain, defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan rebound, should lead them into the match.
Library commemorates anniversary of Wenceslav IV's death with manuscript exhibition
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, from the time of the Roman and Bohemian king Wenceslaus IV, can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Clementine in Prague. The National Library released them from its safes to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
An exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslaus IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archive looks at written heritage from the time of the reign of Wenceslas IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, stated by its author Jan Vojtíšek.
“Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, that is, a prayer book of one of the Benedictine Monastery of St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century,” listed the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where a semi-figure of King Henry II of England is depicted in the opening miniature H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Wenceslaus IV Bible, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see John Wycliffe's Latin choirbook of tractates from the period about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book has been preserved in the Czech territory from the Wenceslav IV library. This library, according to experts, belonged to the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king was eager to build a representative library that would equal the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library became defunct soon after Wenceslaus's death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. Several codes were saved though. The Austrian National Library now owns the most of them.
“We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am pleased that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so called live and not only in the form of a digital library Manuscriptorium,” said Director of the National Library Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition called What's Hiding Under the Floor, which presents the local archaeological discoveries, will open free of charge in Clementinum.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous contagious disease here at the very beginning, but it went without major snags.
Coping with how idiotic a large portion of the population on all its strata is positioning themselves to this, I have a problem with that up to now.
On vaccination (tomorrow!) I'm looking forward to the most because he makes me finally less dependent on other people not being shits.
He would be deprived of the post of president and the eligibility to retake it.
But the chances of this happening are very small, as others here mention.
Moreover, I'm not sure if the miscarding of a file could even be considered high treason.
High treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threaten the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: There is a growing number of people under 35 who are sexless all year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious-based people, the DailyMail website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who disown sex lives rose from eight to 21 per cent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 years old who reported that they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age reporting that they have not had sex for the previous year has grown rapidly,” said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people, in 2021 only 5% of them reported having been without sex for the past year.
For single people it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the decline of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinion about premarital sex divides, with about 30% of it for the wrong thing, while approx. 70% think it's okay.
“It is true that among single individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is shifting that trend,” Stone speaks of those thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious establishment.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to nearly 60 per cent.
Among the “less believers,” the trend has picked up from 10 per cent to 20 per cent,” Stone claimed.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and most importantly social drinking of alcohol during pandemic times.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less likely for people out of work or lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly behind lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
“So it turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than is the reality. In this case, women and non-graduation respondents had a significantly larger share of wrong answers,” said KRUK Director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school students or college students believe their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial affairs from parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).
Questions around finances consult parents primarily women, while information on the internet is more likely to be sought by men. Getting information about finances from parents is prevalent in all ages of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have virtually minimal influence.
“Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent the authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key,” said Palendal.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 per cent of the young.
Unequivocally young people are asked whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and own housing.
94 per cent of those surveyed profess the strategy of saving and investing in tangible fixed assets. This is true across all ages of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The inquiry strategy is then 100% held by people in marital union with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with income above CZK 30,000 per month want to enjoy.
The whole mandating of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force some of the population into behaviors that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's a rather tough question that I'm personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't tell them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80 year old person who didn't actually know much, well we didn't explain it to him, overheard some misinformation, and as a result get inoculated didn't give and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination who rants something about bullying and a totalitarian state here alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly imported that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Brno Grand Prix? Tickets are threatening to get better
The most expensive item is a discarding fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. “The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee,” evaluated by economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the plant is also in attracting tourists to the city. “Brno doesn't have so many world tourist attractions. The grand prize attracts visitors there and from abroad. It is important for Brno as well as, for example, the Tuřan airport or exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money,” the economist added.
Brno Grand Prix
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing listing fee for the promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increasing the price of tickets
- current status: negotiation of a new contract for the holding of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration Filip Hrůza, organizers must now evaluate whether the plant is advantageous for Brno. “The Grand Prix drains money from public budgets for other matters. But to some extent, this is a political issue and not an economic issue,” he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. In the game there is a variant of raising the rebalancing fee to almost double.
“The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to hosting the race. If the worst-case scenarios were to be fulfilled, I fear that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount,” admitted Markéta Vaňková, the mayor of Brno.
As Diary Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also negotiating on the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. “Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that don't occupy cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, a company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor,” explained Vaňková.
Promoters can also receive more money from tickets in the next years. “We have to sit down and say what the costs are actually going to be. And we must adapt to the revaluation of tickets,” said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
I still see myself as a boy who is just peeking out so far, says Jan Cina
“That was a big school for all those who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The way I have something Romani in me in my dad, it has completely dismained me,” said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Far fresher memories than the series The First Step has for the role of a painting director in the new film National Class. Cina revealed that director Stepan Altrichter must have enticed him a lot. “The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was produced a year ago. Heavily and honestly, but at the same time entertaining. It was spun on National Avenue, where as a non-driver I was driving by car. There was also a lot of revolving in the South City of Prague,” he said on the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is a Thalia Award nominee for his role in a production of The Little Prince, he doesn't consider it a career highlight. “I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a kid who's just peeking out so far. But the nomination is very pleasing and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me,” he revealed, saying that he hadn't even thought about the thank-you speech in the event of victory. “Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined me speaking to people.”
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a satisfied relationship? “Liking each other and seeing problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve,” he revealed, reminiscing about the Czech Lions, when his friend fell on the stairs.
“Yes, it actually happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it did not last long and lay on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop, Vanchur's Stairs, where he taught how to fall down stairs safely at VIP events.”
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
The title was received by Costa Rica for several reasons. For starters, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but a lot of countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully transition to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxi cars expected to run on electricity.
The official tourist organization says that already around 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017 Costa Rica worked on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly thirty national parks.
The density of reforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. “Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of conservation, setting an example to other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us,” the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot given the country's small area (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or foggy forests, coral reefs or mangrove marshes are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitoresca waterfalls and you can also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter sign on fighting drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators can not do without technical snow, the weather also complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is it a trend, or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have a story, but it's not about a little boy.
One time in high school, a teacher led us across town to a boatyard so we could ride boats down the river.
On the way there, we walked down one quite wide street and who we do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but she and a friend were talking.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
“They asked me if I said I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul,” she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed all the way through to the boathouse.
We're terribly spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels on Sunday, Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew into Warsaw, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint news conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it jointly clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by disturbing Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, is convenient to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandy Group,” France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured, according to DPA, that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of runners.
Vandal vandals vandalized cemetery in Dobruška
According to the notice received by the police, the vandalism at the scatter meadow inside the Dobrusk cemetery should have occurred between 13 and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
“The material damage was numbered at 60 thousand crowns. Police officers are asking any witnesses to the event to communicate their findings in person on business or by phone on toll-free 158,” police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná said.
CSI officers are investigating the case as damage to a stranger's cause and disorderly conduct, for which it faces up to a three-year jail term.
Drunk Polish nuncane smacks accident, tried to conceal it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police officers told her that she could lose her driver's license for not giving precedence in driving and driving from the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle asking her for help.
The police officers then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and, after discovering she had over two promilles in her blood, promptly removed her driver's license.
At the same time, they notified her that she would be confessing from her actions in court.
Slovaks succeeded, for racist insults only pay a fine
The Slovak Football Association succeeded with an appeal against the closing of the stadium for racism of fans. The representation was originally supposed to play a European Championship qualifier match with Wales without spectators, instead now the union only pays a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand crowns).
UEFA's disciplinary committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for fans' behaviour at a recent reciprocal qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting trusts of Czech coach Pavel Hapal they won 2:1. Both unions closed the stadium for one match and awarded Slovakia a fine of 20 thousand euros, Hungary 67 thousand euros.
Slovaks on appeal were only fined 15 thousand euros for offensive political rants. The closest match of the national team in the European Championship qualifier with Wales on 10 October in Trnava will be made available to fans.
Destroyed shops, fires in streets, remembrance parade accompanied riots
Five years ago, 43 Ayotzinapa college students went missing, despite extensive investigations so far failing to clarify the case. Reportedly, the students were to be detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, according to the investigation, but the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
As a memorial parade was held in Mexico's capital on Thursday, families wanted to express frustration over the fact that they were still failing to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
The mostly peaceful march was disturbed by smaller groups of vandals, destroying everything in their path. Vandals were destroying shops and hotels, not shielding or destroying monuments, setting fires around the city and discharging windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador stated that he would do everything to capture and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
Over 142 people have been detained as part of the investigation, but not one of them has been convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly should have tortured the suspects, APTN adds.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovich did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have been seen in American stories about dog sweethearts.
But they forgot about the essential thing: the regularities of film craft.
After the cheesy film F. Brabek Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, the next film Here We Watch Over is now in store for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-writer and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovich Jr., is a loosely follow-up to his previous film Here I Watch Me from 2012.
A talking dachshund, Hugo, and some well-known characters around him, return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is moribent, so they begin to invite the dog, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the narrative procedures already in the previous dog picture, but there were at least entertained children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is in the desire for a child to obscure delusions, and if the right “constellation” comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined — on the hood of the car or church tower (obviously during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), despite years of training, retired Colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, Whereupon the family is taken from the hospital so that the miraculous process of healing by the dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal darlings.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is astonished at what content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from staff, a doggie competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops arriving at the show looking for “drugs” and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal — and which baked of course, the family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits ondled and made up with cigars at the family table, clamoring for her father's whiskey and slackers as a cured vegetarian, there is no laughing.
The creator will explain to the viewer that “it sometimes happens after a coma”.
Shaymovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to construct load-bearing situations, a flair for character characters and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are unsettled, the cut clueless and the overall impression uptight.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they do not have much to play.
The film's only feature remains poetic footage of the Šumava nature of cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog buzz, let alone the more folksy profanities that the characters indulge.
The argument is not even the years-old membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club — as in the case of Mrs Producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
There's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from exactly nerds like you.
There's a difference between bidding and forcing, here's to see how you understand the turd, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that kind of guy all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in it the case of the earnings brigade.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Majorca. Guarantees were not enough
A petition for insolvency in the week was also filed by the Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, it should be decided by the end of September.
According to Vice-President of the Association of Travel Agents of the Czech Republic Jan Papej, there are three options of possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will be established new travel agency. “Which one it will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will depend on the German owner,” he told CTK today.
In addition to two early tours, CK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised its clients to reimburse the payments, according to Pope, the firm has sufficient collateral to do so.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Majorca, where the company also asked for help from the Czech consulate. The Pope in this connection described the CTK one of the cases in which the hotel there threw out all the tourists offices. “The hotelier could not determine who belongs under the German and who was under the Czech company. He therefore threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees,” he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech arm of bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales to 995 million kronor last year, up nearly 21 per cent more year-on-year, the company's annual report shows. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. In contrast, the company's net profit decreased by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. However, the company remained an outstanding loss of almost CZK 103 million from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions - next to CK Neckermann, it is still Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
The Middle East has been troubled by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have noted it at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports just six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time here.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced by Nazareth resident Wasím Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the three most recent rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water landholders warned of drought long ago.
“It is to be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may wane here,” Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, projected in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Worse off are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
Tanker cars are on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Indeed, water pipes and private wells are drying up.
“This year my orders have soared by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years,” Imad Suleiman, a tanker car driver, reported in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have erupted in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military crackdown on Iran
Israel's defense minister said negotiations in Vienna had yielded “no progress” and that he had briefed Washington on preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Secretary Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis informs.
Gantz, who is staying in the US, has been trying to persuade the Americans to escalate their pressure on Iran, but has also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had yielded “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are messing with them.”

About 3 years ago, this happened to me, too.
I pranked the lady a little and grilled while talking to see what she actually wanted me to do.
Eventually, I discovered that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I took the miss for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a punt, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Semily Museum Returns to Velvet Revolution with Exhibition
An imitation of a standard room with a television in which footage of the brutal crackdown of police officers against students from November 17, 1989 in Prague is running. This, too, is in the museum's new exhibition in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. “The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events at Národní třída,” said the curator of the exhibition Tomáš Chvátal.
“I would say that the atmosphere was the same at the base everywhere with the fact that there was the first demonstration in Semily on November 22, and then more people were gradually packed every day,” he said. Among the most active were the first group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who signed Charter 77 as the only one from the town and the surrounding area, and the Grandfather's spouses, who were the only one from the town and the surrounding area. they were expanding the Several Sentences petition. Quite quickly, according to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was created at that time. “One specific feature is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum,” the curator said.
Around 50 photographs should be drawn into the city at the time, pictures taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989 filmed by František Tomíček has also been preserved, which will be released in a loop throughout the exhibition. At the time, Ivan Hlav spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semile Archive also lent a number of preserved banners at the time. “On them it was: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence,” Chvátal stated. Some of the changes in the city were very rapid at that time, for example already in December the people in the all-semily vote agreed that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name of Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. “In the first part, we introduce to witnesses and students, what was before, such late normalization. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with different communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the museum of the workers' movement at the time,” said Chvátal . One room is supposed to give a sense of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household back then.
The last part of the exhibition, in turn, is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. The focus is on the first free elections. “We papered one room election posters. Those who have experienced this will remember the posters With us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for his village,” added the curator.

Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, plenty of snow and nice weather awaited them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have started operations due to this.
The slope has not been deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts either.
While lifters are not complaining about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rentals are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to the cross-country ski trails and the slopes at the weekend.
Skiers liked the weather, which today offered sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Ještěd Jakub, the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanush.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna in Šumpersk were opened.
Weekend attendance was very respectable, with an estimated 400 people arriving both Saturday and today.
Conditions are surety.
Today the sunshine was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can sell a ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after having had a COVID-19 disease.
With exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn skicentre told ČTK.
“We only recorded incident units,” he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic are reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Interest in renting skis thankfully is.
It's not like the past years, but there are still quite a lot of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from Opava shop Skiopava.
A bigger onslaught is expected during the ski course period.
The executive director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear David Šinták feels that due to covid there is no interest in lending ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were already almost borrowed.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
People, according to him, became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a great demand is noted by the rental company in the Novako premises on the Divine Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must already order them in advance.
“We are starting to rent cross-country skiing this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the premises.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must be able to experience a quality life here like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or doctor specialist.
Abroad are going smart and skilable people who have no assets here.
The owner of a business abroad really doesn't just leave.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people don't see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they just won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one fine day Orban won, reigned for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a couple of tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections at all.
If you live bad, then some traditional V4K freak can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, remain his backers and people whose possessions can't be shoved onto the plane.
Terrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
In doing so, the actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a genuine injury, or is it about making out for the sake of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen following her way home.
“Petra's disappearance is not at all unlike her behavior, and we are starting to have a lot of concern for her,” Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, served as a “nurses assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We have immense concern for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the medical facilities group said in a Twitter post.
“We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help find her to contact police,” the communication continued.
The public is also calling for cooperation by Harriet Harman MP, who raised the Srncova case at a press conference on Saturday.
'She's been missing for days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death, 'said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman in her hand distributed by the London Police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and working here for our health service,” she stated Harman.
Police have previously detained one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of being.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie ca 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine this way either.
These are not “huge amounts” but ca 8 percent of the Russian military.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted at the top.
I don't know what he made out of that Russia wanted the war.
War is one hell of an expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons to the situation in 38 are off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that to the First Punic War and the “annexation” of Sicily:D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it wasn't going to honor the Minsk agreements, Russia annexes those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the “concentration” at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly touching suburban connections
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, became defunct.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, speeders from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradské Město station.
In suburban train services, S7 trains run through Prague Central Station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 speedtrain from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop in the recently opened station Praha-Zahradní Město.
PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will run as far as Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladoboleslavsko region will be incorporated, including overlaps to Liberec and Hradec Královéhrad regions.
At the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones introduced, and traffic will be modified on 12 functioning.
A new bus line 405 will run from Zličín in Prague, which will run all the way to Žatka.
A new direct connection Praha — Kralovice u Rakovník was also established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.

Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 goes via Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, traffic on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, is canceled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are canceled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines Praha — Beroun, Praha — Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes await travelers at other locations as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymbursk region have been changed and some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region are modified.

Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classically 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next door to Billy or a short distance away to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy a maximum of pizza bun and yogurt and apple for snack.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you advise me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, that's the way it is unfortunately
And it's not about the trees that you necessarily need to see.
Only the tip of the sapling can hide under the snow.
If it destructs, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not arguing that's the only reason they forbid us to go off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about the relationship with Nedved: This is not what I was looking forward to
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond lives nothing more than the revelation of the relationship of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been dragging it together since the summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she kept love from them for a long half year.
“I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who missed that Dara caught a bear, I mean sorry, Nedved,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is into the most successful Czech footballer in love with her head.
He said he packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If those who don't care at all and pops it on them even from canned food, or us whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are quite a good fit for each other, or insist that everyone really knows your list in detail former partners and were familiar with enlisting your mistakes and mistakes.
I mean, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was riding for preparations for her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has worked there for a long time as vice-president of Juventus football club.
With the truth out, they went only now because they were waiting for Nedjad's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us, thank you.
Even we are just people, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new man, and as he does with me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, she closed Rolins.
Opening of Pumpkin World delayed pumpkin-ripening
Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - A farmhouse in Nová Ves near Leština in Havlíčkobrodsko has now opened Pumpkin World for more than a month. Decorations made from thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by a massive orange pyramid in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, as the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of Pipkova family fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
Pippas grow many types of pumpkins, but the last two years they have not liked the weather. This year's harvest has been delayed and some species have not gone out. “As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some types for connoisseurers did not succeed,” said Pipková. Nevertheless, several types can be chosen from the farmhouse, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and mortising decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or elongated “spaghetti” to ornamental gourds different colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig the plants and harvest their fruits, snipping from the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. Pumpkin World Pipkovi have been opening regularly since 2010, past vintages attracted thousands of people. The decoration of pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze made of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farmhouse. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details for the event are on the farm website, where growers offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, including pumpkin muffins or juice. About other options for finishing the pumpkin in the kitchen, visitors themselves tell them. “A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, we too get inspired,” said Pipková. She noted that some housekeepers also pickle pumpkins as sour as cucumbers.

Hi, others commenting have probably said all the essentials already, just confirming that the dorms are super to start, my classmates mostly got to know each other during the first semester or two and they made friends and then found sublease together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise themselves very long ahead of time, so you probably won't find much right now, but looking at the offer certainly doesn't hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), some parts of Židenice are a little ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is nice, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where you are going exactly).
I have never wanted rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise Brno as such, if you still lack any information:)
That, to me, is an example of completely “normal” reasoning, though.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite fine that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own or let them go by state and pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will throw in a full state contribution a few crowns and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when written by a person who, two days before, had made such comments about a petitional action for boycotting a totalitarian state:
So a vote against whether someone gets an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, affects five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of both British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
“The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, has not filed an insolvency motion,” Šrámek said in a press release.
“CK Neckermann, however, is forced to continue to cancel scheduled departures of its clients,” he added, saying that this currently applies to all departures between September 26 and October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights affects about 500 clients. Neckermann's 800 clients who are abroad at the moment, according to him, “will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flight is ensured.”
The tour operator admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. “In this case, it is necessary that clients contact the CK Neckermann SOS line without delay,” added Šrámek.
The Thomas Cook crash occurred on Monday. In August this year, the tour operator struck a deal whereby lenders were to inject £900m into the firm.
Half of the sum was to receive from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. The latter was to become majority owned on the basis of this. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as September 20, information emerged that creditors had demanded the travel agent to raise a £200m provision, otherwise the deal falls. Then on Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
I would have consulted directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away from the eye or write something in the way xxx *** or... (by convention) and to note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd deal with it probably somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and trying student, you could look into some character databases and look up the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits with what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't that, by any chance, more like the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than Odrynian?
PSS: someone already cracked this place for you.
Check out that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the “theme” of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The notion that they would approve of something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for this anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus, with that English, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
Trump considering deregistering Chinese shares in US
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoke permits for Chinese firms to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Shares of the affected firms on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report, dragging down the entire market with them.
The stock pullback would be part of a broader effort to curb US investment in China, the source added. He thus confirmed a Bloomberg report that had sparked a shock in financial markets shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI were losing anywhere from two to four per cent.
Shares of 156 Chinese firms are trading on US exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE, according to government data from February. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg cautioned that a precise mechanism had not yet been developed to ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese firms from US stock exchanges. The eventual plan would have to be approved by Trump, who but gave negotiations on the matter the green light.
China and the US have been waging a trade war with each other for more than a year, under which they have imposed tariffs on each other. The two countries' dispute is having negative effects on the world economy and raising fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington, using customs fees, is trying to get Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's surplus in trading with the US.
According to CNBC television's server, US-China trade talks are expected to resume on October 10. It aims to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not at risk, reports the Kremlin. But there is a change of operator in the game
The Department of Transportation on Friday began preparations for a new tender to operate the new toll system. At issue is a fallback plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract was repealed. In addition, the state is preparing another provisional solution if the tender could not be completed in time. On Facebook, Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík said this (for YES).
The Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) on Thursday banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the Czechtoll/SkyToll consortium, with an annual deferral. The ministry will file a decomposition against this.
“The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll consortium and SkyToll,” the minister said.
The state would thus seek in the tender for the operator of the currently forthcoming toll, which will be launched from this December. So it would not be a competition for an entirely new tolling system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. “Based on my experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is wrong and that within the period of 12 months it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such complex procurement and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator,” he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the Resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would resolve the collection of tolls for a temporary period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
Thus, the state will not yet take advantage of the offer made to it by the current administrator of the Kapsch toll in the past days. The Austrian firm of the state offered to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that he believed a backup plan would not be needed. Therefore, the Ministry will file a decomposition against the decision of the Antitrust Authority.
The ÚOHS issued a ruling on Thursday prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. But the ban will not begin to apply until a year after the legal power of the Office This is not the final one, and it can be applied against it to the President of the Office. Therefore, both the Ministry and CzechToll continue to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the Czechtoll/SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in the toll tender with a bid of 10.75 billion kronor for the 10-year operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against both the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with a bid of over 13 billion crowns.
“Terrifying study result.” Islam doesn't belong in the West, think the vast majority of Austrians
1,200 respondents were surveyed, the survey shows considerable distrustfulness of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for the introduction of a ban on the construction of mosques. For greater follow-up of centers of Islam, 80 percent of those polled are.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.
“The outcome of the study is frightening,” argues study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: “Such a propensity for ethnocentrism could, over time, lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. Religious freedoms granted to Muslims threaten to taper off.”
In believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not about conflict between religions but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, voters of the extreme right, people without higher education, or seniors over 75 years old, hold the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims. Most welcoming, on the other hand, are Green voters, people under 30 and college students.
Some 700 thousand Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of roughly 8.7 million, according to estimates from the Austrian Interior Ministry. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion there since 1912.
I don't get the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for the third year and totally cool.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
Only someone who hasn't set foot in his life can say that's ghetto.
Yeah, probably most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good downtown accessibility, I'd feel free to go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Daddy and mistress Gelemova like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most of the people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slovacek did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Daddy wreath, and Lucie certainly has some, said Blesku the saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
She visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently reunited with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.

Felix Slovacek and Lucie Gelemová: BACK TOGETHER!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy Dada and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone who I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Luďk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he was making that clear.
“Parody of Justice.” Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was related to an increased incidence of cancer among local residents.
Scientists mainly mentioned the Dilovasi Industrial Zone, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and which houses a number of chemical and smelting plants. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan takes respite for putsch, international criticism despite
It seemed to Sik that, notwithstanding the clear conclusions of the study, the government was taking no action on the matter. He therefore wrote several articles about the research in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for divulging classified information.
“The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances,” Sik told reporters after the verdict. “The court's decision shows that the results of studies that relate directly to public health can be clouded. This is unacceptable,” the scientist added.
“Instead of pursuing people sounding the alarm through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health problem,” said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing regulations on, despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions, environmental protection.
After the foiled 2016 putsch, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a sweeping wave of arrests. Almost 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities have also put off-duty or discharged 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces altogether.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the attempted putsch to persecute its opponents. But authorities are balking at the fact that these are measures needed to ensure national security.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have both troops and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, explain that to me then?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and they can't afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava is going to the head of previous governments, not the army, they have been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change farm subsidies, the landscape is not meant to be just a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought period in years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreases in mountainous and submontane areas, the smaller amount of rainfall is recorded even in places where there has been no emergency of moisture.
Climate change is the cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe.
The impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveller Sigismund or General Bocek. Senate handed out commemorative medals
Sixteen-year-old Bocek, who was a fighter in the British Air Force during the Second World War, gave thanks on behalf of all those awarded medals. “The Senate was one of the first to not forget and forget war veterans,” he stated, among other things. “The award I took over today also belongs to my mates who are no longer among us,” he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. “Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we want to or don't want to. After all, it is from these values that our successful present is based,” said Kubera.
Awarded were cardiologist and most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of Tomas Bata University in Zlín Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveller and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The upper house hailed his heroism - this January he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them from a burning car. Medals were also given to former presidents of the upper house Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch.
Sigismund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a number of documentary material. Fištejn was both commentator and director of broadcasting for Radio Free Europe, now working with public media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and scriptwriter, musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission to oversee the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was given in advance by astronomer and head emeritus of the UN Office for Space Affairs Luboš Perek, in July on the occasion of his 100th birthday. By the end of the year, the Czech born and the first US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among others, are to receive the same award. the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
Harry in Princess Diana's footsteps (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she aroused a fuss when she visited Africa and especially a minefield. The images, showing him wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face, have become iconic. And then no one could have suspected that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe her last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry has also boarded up as he has made his way to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine removal site in Dirico, Angola, also put on a special protective suit and was very thoughtful. Surely he did not resist the memories of his beloved mum, whom he lost at just 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war took place. “Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community to find peace with which opportunities come,” he said, appealing also to save and maintain wild nature and local rivers as a source of water. Following this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved on to Huambo to have the local orthopaedic centre renamed just after his famous mum, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it even on his official Instagram account: “The Duke is honoured to be able to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to get acquainted with their tireless mission and speak for all those who (Diana) felt they needed the most to be heard, even though the problem wasn't popular worldwide,” it appeared in an instagram post Sussex Royal.
But it may freeze royal fans that he didn't take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a quest for memories of Diana. The two have had a separate program with Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.

Yeah, I can barely keep myself in ice skates, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey, and that tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is a whole lot.
And whether you are a hockey team “copper Russia” or “llama china” so losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is matched.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators prying out, what the referees don't notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and “Italian actors” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, and that the Czech Republic lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be classic “vthey lost” vs “WE won”.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes fail to do well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the run-up to the 800 metres and the qualification was not passed by the tyččková Romana Maláčová or the hammer Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, with which she surprised the previous last year London.
The run-up on Friday will be completed by the hurdler Vít Müller and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Safránková threw 65.46 metres with her third attempt and fell nearly six metres behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already above her strength. To participate in the final it was necessary to reach the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who reached the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in fourth run-up on the penultimate sixth place and did not even have a time of 2:03 .48 minutes her to advance to the semifinals was not enough. It fell behind its high this year by one and a half seconds. “It was quite fast on me, unfortunately I was fighting my opponent in the corner, which made me quite a bit of strength. I thought I still had the powers, but that's where it hampered me. I almost stopped and had to break again, so in this one it was kind of uncomfortable. I cannot be completely satisfied,” said the Czech representative.
She was glad to overtake at least one female opponent in the finishing straight. “She really wasn't doing well, so any defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately,” she added. The fastest halfback in the run-ins was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in 2:00 .36.
In Doha, the best eight-woman of recent years is missing Caster Semenyaova from JAR, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but like some other female runners, she refuses treatment she has since this year, the rules of the IAAF mandate.
In the run-up to the 100 metres, the role of the number one favourite was confirmed by American Christian Coleman, who took a time of 9.98 as the only one under the ten-second threshold. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at 37 is aiming to defend his title, also advanced to the semi-finals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who with 9.86 performance is two of this year's tables and was expected to fight Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season.
The Kubánec Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form already in the qualification of distance men, who took the first jump to a distance of 840 cm. No athlete has jumped that far in the MS qualifiers in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's table with 865 cm.
Slovenians beat the Polish world champions as well and are in the final of the ME
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the premier European Champions title. Backed by nearly 12 thousand storming fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions beat the Poles 3:1 and are the first runners-up.
Who they challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team performed much more compactly in the semifinals than the Polish world champions. Those belonged only to the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players were outperforming in defence and the players in the red-and-white jersey basically scored only the native of Cuba Leon.
But the home lineup featured both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut in life form, as well as the second-round Štern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini. The Poles have paid to win all previous games at this Euro sovereignly, while the Slovenians were gaining confidence after tough play-offs battles with both Bulgarians and Russians.
With the Poles this August, the Slovenes lost 1:3 in the Olympic qualifier in Gdańsk, but they reciprocated the defeat at home. But now the sold-out Ljubljana Arena Stožica leaves. They still have a second medal in history after today, but in Paris they can improve on an unexpected silver from the ME four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, Slovenians finished eighth, only behind the Czech national team.
Planet-friendly. Scientists' Night begins in Prague
“In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at a model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, to which other times there is no access for the public,” advises the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists Jitřenka Navratilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy and the opportunity to try to work with surgical instruments.
“Then I would go to ČZU and watch the film Green Desert,” Navratilova adds. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is “planet-friendly.”
Coronavirus: The number of diseases in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 100 000 in the Czech Republic 1967, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an 'inevitable' major wave of contagion, caused by Omikron, said on television on Sunday Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviserwoman for the British Health Security Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Those infected with omicron are already hospitalised in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
No one has died of omikron yet, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer found on Sunday that Boris Johnson appears to have broken the law by staging a lockdown last December, when lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned, in Downing Street Christmas quiz.
One minister in the Johnson government defended that the quiz took place “virtually,” via a computer.
However, it was attended in Downing Street by groups of staff, gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the prime ministerial post.
During last December, when strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
Both the British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election overwhelmingly.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much is there to expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán weren't like that either.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of voting precincts to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
That will allow Fidesz to bind voters from decided precincts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that fair they won't be at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be a matter of not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority as well.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
This is a big non-fuss for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in trying to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of parliament speaker and one of the leaders of Fidesz, Lászlóa Kövér, leaked to independent media outlets telling secret service chiefs that the opposition was a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.

I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my daddy has her long, but then she slams extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I fretted like a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and was all blue, they took it under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me an educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, as a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I can at least punch into something, and as a younger one, for example, I slapped my parents on the hand (to she didn't get much through the holdout), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share of it, too.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it wasn't “nurturing” anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just did something Fucks up, I guess it's not possible to get your kids at least a little prick, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws are to be clear and unambiguous
So I would call Kundami those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of an income outage?
Can it really be counted on that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage out of?

Scientists are looking for toddlers with a birth defect called ankle valgosity into their study
Valgosity (deposition) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. As standard, it is treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly accelerate the treatment.
'We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children as well as children diagnosed to map the effect in both groups. Participation in research will not have any risks for children and measurements will be completely painless,” explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can report to the study via a website where a registration form and all information is available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children diagnosed and fifty children healthy. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
“The moment when parents should sign up for their child is when they take the first separate steps, typically letting go of, for example, furniture that they hold on to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and half of the participants also involves wearing tested footwear,” it points out Gimune.
Kochner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the main story begins in the trial of four defendants of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kushnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kčner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a turning point will the process mark for Slovakia?
Sparta is really packed this year, acknowledges Hradec bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's game against the club where he recently worked. But the former Spartan is convinced that his team-mates will be similar to it, even if they have never donned the jersey of the Prague club.
“Everyone wants to pull against Sparta,” says Hradecký bek before the match of the 5th Extraliga Round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch his series of wins, which at the moment is three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came the most appreciated by fans on Sunday, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
“But we can't watch the matches for what they were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them equally, if not better,” points out the defender Hradec.
The Hradec people should not even look back on last year's balance sheet with Sparta. They lost in three of the four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. Moreover, the Sparta management has brought in several significant reinforcements over the summer and expects a return among the top from the team.
“Sparta have always had quality players but what we'll chat, they're really loaded this year,” admits Nedomlel ahead of the first game later this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.

Journalists are hugely responsible for this.
How is it that this petition had orders of magnitude more media attention than a counter petition by the deans of all medical schools that came out a day, two later?
No, they got screwed up and the company bounced it off.
Czech television was dying with covid until half a year ago.
Lucia White's father didn't cheer for her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and her own name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie White knew from a fairly early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she performed as a little girl in a cultural house in her native Otecovice, where the Petnice still lives.
“And I remember exactly where Mommy sat. Back then, a singer was born in me,” she admitted to Impulse radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to follow the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
“Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground! ' He even cajoled me if I wanted to go to the local glass factory. The glassworks no longer work, I quite do. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs for money,” she added with a laugh.

Jan Šindelář's Comment: Manage Railways as a Company
Heavenly's election, while apparently not entirely smooth, is the cull of a sad story about the state's inability to give the runways clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday night, that doesn't change because one of the members resigned. Provisorium lasts.
The selection process itself was a farce from the beginning because the requirements for candidates mainly in the field of practice were significantly mitigated. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the firm in which the candidate was supposed to operate in the past have been disengalised. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of a pimprlat.
Nebeský presented probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without practice from a large company he needed experienced executives from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the lightest side (and the best hope) of the whole process. Today, those people already know that they have played only the role of the expedient backdrops in the political game.
Perhaps Heavenly will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best boss of the lanes of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political sappy. Czech Railways does not expect a light period, they have to cope with competition in market liberalisation and with a shortage of employees in operation. Drivers, shunters and mechanics alike are missing. What are they supposed to have motivation for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in a china shop?
The second important group is lenders. How the games at the head of the tracks will be laid out, we will see next spring, when the tracks defend the rating. What is certain is that lenders perceive instability. The sad thing is that someone else comes to Moody's for Czech Railways to defend the rating every year. The agency's frequent changes in runway management and political influence over the firm have not escaped, criticizing them as early as this summer.
The YES movement has, among other things, the motto that the state needs to be managed as a company. For starters, it would be enough to run one large state-owned firm as a firm and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if they were run by the best. They reported, but the state despised them. Certainly one can argue that the post at the head of the runways has always been a political issue. But then we can forgive ourselves the clown shops with the tender.

Another government ends and a law involving municipalities in choosing a repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law, which was intended to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in selecting and allowing deep water storage of high radioactive wastes, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government discontinued consideration of a proposal submitted to the Government after years of protractions by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect from the law to strengthen their options more significantly when deciding on the repository that has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which the Czech atomic law and the European directive calls for.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition treaty.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which has the Platform available, concerns municipalities in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of the site for the repository is inadequate and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Management to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed substantive intention proposal almost completely neglects public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statists in permitting procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of locating and selecting a site for the repository, its permitting and operation.
Really according to today's legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit comments or appeal, but the office or minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation shall decide.
Any action shall not have a deferential effect on the implementation of exploration or construction work.
Codecision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced the authorization of storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and a follow-up to contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Vice-Mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesperson of Platform Against Deep Storage said: After the Ministers of Industry who straighten the position of self-governments to the state authorities in search of a deep-sea repository of highly radioactive wastes only condemned on their successors, we are waiting for a more significant reversal from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand to this.
For our support, we also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a major construction similarly as directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The Anti-Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 societies) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-water storage.
Furthermore, the platform advocates that the decision to select the site for possible storage is subject to prior approval of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced into a slimming scare: He shed 90kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually shed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180kg, The Sun newspaper reports.
He flaunted his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing furniture to crack.
“I was poking everything in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can no longer afford to sit still, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends what boss and what you want to use the word “boss” in.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so the “boss” is something like the master/ruler of the given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are bosses hidden (super boss, hidden boss) who are not needed to beat at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games, where bosses are, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
Well, then there are mini bosses.
Ono lump in one word somehow translate boss just probably not even possible, Czech and other languages does not solve it somehow (interesting is only Catalan, which bosse translates as final adversary).
It is in short for a story or game in general significant, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
And where are the viewers? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as the pilgrimage to Doha has been voluntarily and knowingly renounced by athletics the riveting atmosphere prevailing at a sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite the “biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
“Target tickets are sold out for all evenings,” the organisers claim.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of Khalifa Stadium with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators is already covered with colourful tarps, which also depict the flags of 209 participating countries. Athletics has gone to a territory in Qatar where, despite the annual Diamond League meeting, it has no roots.
So let's not be surprised that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for ten days of the championships, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, i.e. less than 400 crowns.
Organizers have now set out the goal that the uncovered parts of the bleachers will be filled at least half. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (albeit the organisers themselves deny it) giving away free tickets to migrants who work here as labourers, as well as children. Which Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can also comment positively: “This is how we can inspire generations to come.”
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, after athletics will come football in 2022. The oil power's financial offers will always be lucrative even for wealthy sports federations. Such is the reality of today's sporting world.
But even if we approach it and pass away the absence of fans in the stadium, we do not resist the purely sporting sigh that experiment with the first outdoor world athlete championship at the Arab the peninsula's IAAF leaders should have timed better - and for a different year. Extremely late term, forced by the climate, hacks the entire scheme of the pre-Olympic season and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally be athletes already in October was beginning.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for it at least with technological novelties, with the help of which it promises ultra-modern and attractive mastery. That it's just 37 degrees? Already now the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built right in the blocks, are supposed to give television viewers a detailed approach to what takes place in athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko since December 7.
Throughout Interpol at the same time, he helps British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.

Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She became involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
“We have huge concerns about her,” she said at a Saturday news conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police officers have already detained one suspect.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czechia terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October pointed to a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are purposefully aimed at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is intended to arouse attention in the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous appendix had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11, 2021... exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, for example, email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored logins, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, Formbook spyware remained active as well.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November picked up rather campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still stands for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks ran continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook included most often an attachment with the extension .exe, which carried the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at Fareit, which was behind 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
That demos of smarts today who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to footage of the parade down the embankment and in my experience as a protester, I'm not afraid of an estimate of around 10 thousand people.
People in the parade filled both the waterfront and the bridge and the opposing riverfront road.
That means people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the parade of about four thousand protesters.
I argue that something new is born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers, anti-gappers and Co. couldn't fill or pay for this big parade.
The actions of the Chcípled Dog Association have an upward popularity, reminds me of A Million Misters for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get this impression that they rent the same podium and technique as well.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be made of this discontent depends not only on the supply of money, but also whether the Pfizer three-dose vaccine doesn't become four and more dosed.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or center movement, bet that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost definitely become multi-dose, since it is obvious that we will have to get re-vaccinated every half a year.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
End Stalemate, Bulgaria Has New Prime Minister Reaching Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked with assembling a new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections.
That has already managed to put together a government of broad coalition that is expected to take office within days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the past government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost elections.
However, the victorious parties preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not be agreed, so two more early elections followed.

Of the “secretly” footage taken, it is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been searching for days by London police.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home to the south of the British metropolis from work.
For information about a children's hospital worker, besides the police, calls from her existing employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
“Petra's disappearance is not at all unlike her behavior, and we are starting to have a lot of concern for her,” Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth neighborhood where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left her job at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last reportedly spotted on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová, according to British media, served as a “nurses assistant” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs under the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
“We have immense concern for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” the medical facilities group said in a Twitter post.
“We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help find her to contact police,” the communication continued.
Šumperska amateur children's room painter Zdeněka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councilor) said that she violates copyright by her paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of the Mole in the Šumperské humperské rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch has appeared for a month.
It was about life.
The Magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs to, and because it said it was unresponsive, the hole went on.
Eventually the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to “intensively deal with the situation”.
Microplastics made it all the way to human intestines, first time study confirmed
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwable has published a study that proves for the first time the presence of microplastics in human faeces. Although small, the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, tiny particles of plastic measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in the samples of all the people surveyed. None of the eight subjects was vegetarian, six of them did not shy away from sea fish, all drinking water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be kind of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example, for the needs of the beauty industry, or are created by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the digestive tract of a person is only officially confirmed. Ten grams of stool accounted for around 20 microplastic particles, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness suspect that this is not a good thing. But humanity still doesn't know how wrong it is - and what effect microplastics have on “host” organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. 'It is the first ever study of its kind and confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics occurrence in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health,” says Schwabl.
Meanwhile, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, primarily polypropylene. But that will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep increase. In terms of plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, humanity consumes a fifth more of them than it does today. The current pace is a rousing one million bottles bought per minute. Roughly eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans each year. The waste threatens marine ecosystems and infests the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already stepped up to restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example - under threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well known straws), and the Czech Ministry of Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures, while nice, are totally inadequate.
