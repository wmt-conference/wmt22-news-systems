The story was about anxiety and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his big cats.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP giants Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
Youngster Johannes Patrick could at least be relied on.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim cup defeat at the beginning of October: “We still have some anger in our guts.”
However, it didn't subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
The manner of the performance was even more disappointing than the naked result.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any more questions?

While in Patrick's team, top performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has declined more and more, so I want to breathe a bit with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was canceled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and start accident, you would still have the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) can still show.
Apparently, however, it is the case that F1 enjoys priority for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished broadcasting the race.
Nevertheless, small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in F1, so both did not know that tires could be changed under a red flag.
Although this situation has already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I am of the opinion that you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork as to what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about rules.
In general, I don't like Roos's contrived commentary style, but admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better there.
There are also constant silliness that simply make both look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or “uuuuHD” by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he obviously doesn't take it seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the run-out lap, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV, as only the German audio track has to go without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two stations also advertise less in the training sessions than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, but that alone doesn't let me ignore the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language station to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job apart from advertising in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.

The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the fan pump model, they are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or similar could be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air vent or similar by means of a 4/6 mm air hose... and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if water were to run backwards, the water from the pool running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that use little energy

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's “New Shepard” rocket system from Blue Origin.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back,” said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and did everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
“New Shepard” flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The missile system “New Shepard” flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above ground, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned all-outing: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek,” as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy boss of Blue Origin Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and regardless of the climate.

NEKTON-organic gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is exclusively due to nutritional errors.

No other vitamin supplement should be given while using NEKTON-BIO.
NEKTON-BIO is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.

GDR handicraft model old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayman ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, may also have come from the small series companies ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are refurbished for operation
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG thus determined delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01—06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn repair plant in Dessau, the worthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When, as the Central German grid progressed, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were preferably built up.
It was only when it was foreseeable that the workup number could not be increased any further in the case of the E 94 did the E 95 become the focus of the workup.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation plan, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
It often happened that contactors stuck during switching operations.
Then the sideman, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to release the shooter again while driving with a hammer and wooden wedge.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months-long failures of the locomotive.
[5] Since enough new-build locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most types of fragmentation, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives with one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01, which resigned from service on October 5, 1970.
The envisaged new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turnout heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial exterior refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The interior of the locomotive was completed in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is looked after as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Hall P community have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Arnstadt Museum Bw with new inner and outer paintwork, during which the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to become a Central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia

To refute fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Ugur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network “LinkedIn”
Biontech boss Ugur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
Şahin said that a friend's illness had prompted him to do so.
CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine,” Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
“For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He didn't ask why.
“However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.”
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, and sometimes it is better to share personal experiences because of this.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Ugur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
“I am currently not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself,” Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization for vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times.

Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases therefore probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to live without electricity for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The utility company Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely remedied late in the evening.

We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and THW for their tireless efforts,” said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology in a statement on Saturday evening.
It will take a few more days to repair the damage, as Westnetz fitters were only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation at first, he explained.

Fertility treatment for private health insurance /What is an “insured event”?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with private health insurance, it suddenly goes wrong.
In turn:
We had applied for fertility treatment from the private health insurance company in advance and received the approval of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with private health insurance.
We again applied for reimbursement of costs from PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive with private health insurance), we submitted the bills to PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish to have children is a new insured event.
According to the terms and conditions, however, “The insured event begins with medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment.”
The questions for the experts in the panel here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should private health insurance have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts expire with birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance event?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts gave their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!

“Half victory” against Belarus entails high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce “half a victory” in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus” border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in the long term, explained the researcher from the Berlin Science and Policy Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in very small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with people on the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
“It obviously cannot assert itself if a member state sets its mind to do its thing,” like Poland at the moment, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: An agreement in principle on asylum policy would be made more difficult because the line “border protection, border protection, border protection” has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.

According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to receive medical care from a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.

The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
EU commissioners also traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, said Bossong.

problems with fiber + Devolo DLAN/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems establishing a stable WiFi network.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo dLAN, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit perfectly apart from a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the dLAN module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrives at the other dLAN module that emits the Wifi, but the further I move in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\ ~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the dLAN, there were similarly large losses here as well.

While many banks have used autumn to use all sorts of tricks from their customers to confirm past fee increases, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, has long been considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered it for overnight money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
However, these lower allowances now apply to Deutsche Bank as a whole, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for “newly made individual agreements with existing customers.”

Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe one - or the other will feel the same way...
I am 24, have KPTSs, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in association due to burning).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week), which is very bothering me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomachache right now, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and stroking.

So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.

movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live herself, I mean.
I think the crossing is also the soldier's burial place.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If that means anything to you I am grateful for any answer.

No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
20 litre capacity also swallows larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in terms of everyday objects remains well organized and separable from photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has a lot to offer - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: The first is conventional via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different “fill levels”: there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the backpack's suitability for everyday use enormously: when you not only take your photo equipment with you, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side to access camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, while everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and don't get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the backpack's outer shell is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if you're due to go to Scotland in the fall.

Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who values reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure a high level of comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while the gates improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car with their attractive and striking appearance.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was called “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You'll also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Their selection is then revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets banned!
This deactivates half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the start of each round and thus changes the available promotions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has concealed each location once and the year ends.
There is a gunfight in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you first!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking up everything that can be thought up.
Before I go out here... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm doing the ref as a career changer right now.
Originally I studied something else and also worked in one area there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't name anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up as a teacher and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third “I Google other job postings”.
And it's only been half a year.
In the previous times, I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely done right now.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
It's a vacation now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening after work was my end.
I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and when viewed from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely closes down - if it's not already doing so.
I wonder if I would like to have it that way for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but appropriate for it was paid and worked out together in a team and not as a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place in a year as I am now and am dissatisfied.
You notice it's all kind of confused, but maybe you, as an outsider, have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, which I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make any decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.

What does Iceland present at the book fair
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit, which perfectly recreates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state of the art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this ingenious circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances bubble.
With VOX's “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string action, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly depicts the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.

Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, at 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” Island Council President Mariano Hernández Zapata told state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damages
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees Celsius, has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cold lava created two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly severely affected, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper “El País.”

Christmas and presents
Christmas is just around the corner and children in particular will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving gifts, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making “social contract of primitive peoples,” escapes from the rigid routine and is filled with life again in the context of this tradition can be.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked Christmas days to giving presents.
Before that, gifts were presented to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into their window to save them another life in sin in one night.
This unconventional type of gift giving gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling children's boots with gifts in particular.
Protestants opposed this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as “veneration of saints.”
For these reasons, they are defending themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Santa Claus the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, it annoys only a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, gift giving day was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful mess about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Santa Claus, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the historical figure's rather strict Assyrian beard, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Switching off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.

Ref: Schedule Lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having big problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free at school (which is annoying for geography).
It simply takes me a long time to plan my lessons right now.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me, every hour actually stands alone.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest an excessive amount of time for simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to set it up (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I'm rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets too.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.

Retailers fear Christmas shopping due to the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about slumps in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth in sales slumps in transactions with articles for non-daily use.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole,” said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost just under a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things only go well in food retailing and in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
“2G in shopping won't get us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic,” he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the received wristband.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies were recently a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, while sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the midst of such important Christmas business,” CEO Wilhelm Wellner told the “Wirtschaftswoche.”
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort involved, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which “visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed.” dpa

The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or at short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work both on a movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach areas.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press one of the memory keys for a longer period of time and you're done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when switched on again - Very practical when working in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery One of the biggest strengths of DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is also built in - a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two display indicators (the left battery on the top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply unit.

“Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had won twice in series last, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SBU turned on, shot off the frustration of a mixed start to the season within a good hour and won furiously with 5:2. “It's amazing what the boys did today,” cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave “blanket praise to everyone who was there.”
Initially, it looked like another dampening for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place, still short of their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkusen team in the lead 2:0.

Damper for women's handball ahead of quarter-final against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women snuck off the floor with their heads hanging and blank looks.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now have to face hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.

However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarter-finals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this building proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to its principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but the sound level is to be exceptionally high.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tonally tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is common practice in broadband networks in order to optimize the bundling that is too high.
Aligned precisely to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outwards, the treble range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which are suspicious of reference, ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all panels have been cut to size (e.g. in a hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate location so that the cable can be easily routed through there later.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the “Detail Chamfer” image.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the base are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
A suitable circular saw or a Forstner drill makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the rear wall.
A round cutter is then used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off in this way.
The foot plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum/blow out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is to use the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear panel.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot up to the terminal opening and allowed to protrude there by approx. 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is routed to the loudspeaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions turnout Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed on, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
According to the description, the attenuation now follows.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed down with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
