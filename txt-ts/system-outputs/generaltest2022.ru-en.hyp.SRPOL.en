From my point of view, the program on literature was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Teenagers in general are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to represent a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such color and with such a petal structure, resembling velvet, usually dark red, burgundy tones.
And the light roses look different, the petals have just a satin or silky shine.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a slab of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of a "wave" or "gamak" effect.
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as well as coconut coir.
Thanks to this, the healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The mattress is also subject to an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and contaminants is assigned to the removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow in pairs to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - the coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrei, it was clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher will not be able to help either, he was not taught this, the schoolboy plays games in the window.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests are on the doorstep, and on the stove more cutlets are fried, mom scratching the floor.
Lord, let him sit down at the table already without strength.
And then I'll change the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days shake, a day of cleaning after.
And the guests what?
They are good, and the cake is sure to be with them.
Since then, I do not like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at a minimum.
And I prepare delicacies for them, bake very often just like that.
Germany: A fourth coronavirus vaccine is imminent
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be sufficient for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the influenza vaccination."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination could help combat the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus strain.
Moreover, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of reinfection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is confirmed by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus Omicron.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21Â®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, not just for casting.
These vibes have a higher specific weight than their similarly sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of strong and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in the swell Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, that is, up-and-down movements of the pinnacle almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, choked with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, which can be hooked.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching zander and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive bait feed is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with or without a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to tease the passive pike, which does not react even to live.
When fishing, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious, it fits well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For catching pike, zander, buckwheat or perch, besides uniformly relevant and "step," sometimes with a "chirp" on the bottom.
If you catch in hardened places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hitches.
Among the lures of its class Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success in relatively shallow and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young slackers sit on the necks of old parents.
The "golden youth" are clearly lazy for the most part, knowing nothing and knowing nothing.
A well-fed life disposes to idleness.
Perhaps Mishustin was referring to this large part of the population.
You're kidding, right.
I have never seen shoes in this store that I would like to buy.
What perennial sock are you writing about?
This shoe is made of leather.
It is good if one season will endure.

7,000 Russian mercenaries claimed in Libya
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of PMC Wagner in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu news agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency said in a publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to operate in nine countries in Africa - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries," the article reads.
According to the media, the "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the security agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not included in the personnel lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that this decision will be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of deputies of the parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"The elections are less than two weeks away, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this background, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Policy Through Russian Eyes
38% of Russians see the country's foreign policy as more successes than failures, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes - "in Syria they defended, restored peace there," "the decision on Nord Stream 2," "the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons," "Crimea we pressed."
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," "isolation from the world," says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become digital only
The government of Dubai has announced the complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the emirate's crown prince and chairman of Dubai's executive council, said on Saturday.
Now, internal and external workflows in all Dubai government agencies will only be carried out digitally through dedicated information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: health care, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and document digitization began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary value.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that e-services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, it's already marasmus, about the class and the group in the kindergarten too.
Well, I don't believe that there are such stretches.
And if they do, then they are obviously all over the place, including the family.
My mother lived, her two brothers and grandfather and grandmother on 3 Vladimirskaya, was 1st floor without bars.
They knocked first on the door, then on the window, then decided not to be ceremonious, broke the window and climbed in, but my grandfather had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's automobile production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's automobile production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry's 11-month performance was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if in the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive dynamics to last year, in the 11 months of 2021, the output of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of Kazinform.
127 "On approval of the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans of small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted, Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities to provide deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including IP, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the option of the SME entity.
The borrower's application could specify a different period of deferred payments.
During the period of deferral, the claim work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection of fees and other payments by the lender were suspended in relation to the borrower," the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferral of payments on loans of 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
MFIs submitted applications for deferral of 131 SMEs, of which the deferral was granted to 95 entities in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the "ocmiron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "ocmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ocmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
That is, when mutated, he encountered no resistance from immunity.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, he became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than they should, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So it happens in pneumococcal infections, when the young 30-year-old dies, and the old 60-year-olds suffer it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is frenzied in the young, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, it beats like a cannon on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to eliminate only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - it is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated.
Virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory of MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by cow disease.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarten students, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the genomic engineering laboratory of MIPT.
A huge thanks to the author for this article.

Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they arranged dances to their music.
Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis of why obese people fall prey to cowbells
The authors examined adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from cot death and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this.
Biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome manifests itself by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person struggles to navigate even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders and deficiencies of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of FGAOU VO RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Impairments at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to repatriate some 30,000 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gaouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaouad specified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Now the department staff is working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural treasures are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held a auction on July 4, where the bust, more than 3 thousand years old, was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic arrived in Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities smuggled out of the country at various times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers."
"The Crimean Tatars are not counted" - and rightly so, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank uses the right to inspect mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to telecommuting, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to resolve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but hardest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego."
He is already outside any literary associations, spat with Imaginism, he is on his own, but known, in demand, at times scolded by critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him.
During the year more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Rus Sovetskaya" was published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary Sergey Alexandrovich poets received such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange the family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is painted mostly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and desolate field,
Like a grove in September,
Brainwashing alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had given up a lot, looked bad, was clearly ill.
There are more and more repeated ramblings, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin will get to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this ground, and drives to the police abound - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 1920s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly stayed with a friend, the Imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found it in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
"I came only to spend the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell in the stairwell...
Falling, he scratched his face and grunted.
After recovering a little, he began to cough incessantly, spraying the whole sheet with blood..."
Yesenin himself, after a voyage through Europe and the United States (there was Prohibition in the States at the time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except cabbies and streets...
I'm at the end and people have stopped memorizing...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because the anguish was gnawing."

Now the son is almost 16, and he has not been tormented by the desire to fool.
All the energy is directed to the choice of what he will earn his living.
He is much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who had occasional problems with the law before the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry in the exam, when she had not failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school.
Well it will have a tail.
So what?
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.

Polish Foreign Ministry says Belarus uses migrants as "weapons" against EU
Polish Foreign Ministry says Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively searching for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is sure that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many places of the world."
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced a fifth set of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
The social events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not conform to the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah also tried the trend.
The footballer came to collect the seventh Ballon d'Or in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.

AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service analysts, received by Gazeta.ru, they began to be bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are available in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is Gucci, in which came to one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of intertwining threads, a dense fabric with a ravenous outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a gala event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable if the invitation includes the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with wealth, - believe the authors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion "Beautiful Brummell." - Holders of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a jacket made of velvet with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brummell" are sure that the appearance in a velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at a corporate event will be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then - "yes," he is such a thing in the subject."
If the employee is lower rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely evaluate this with the phrase "not according to Senka hat," - believe the editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It is an unnatural timbre, so tortured pulling.

It's all about money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.
A billion-dollar investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also out of the question - gas, oil, and coal all bought cheaper than they currently sell.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The penny drops.
And then who is in the span?
As usual - the ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "sleep" the energy crisis.

Just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not sit down to such, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful people (-its) ," but certainly not because of their appearance.

The immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron "
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron."
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"Under the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or he got vaccinated and got sick, then he got "hybrid immunity," that is, antibodies are plentiful and neutralizing enough," the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to "relax the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities," as US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to settle the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G-7 foreign ministers also say.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained stance.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement added.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the G-7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer's vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This is the conclusion of scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We find that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukraine's Defense Minister Accuses Germany of Blocking NATO Arms Supplies to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to deliver arms under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons as a risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite Russia's "occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat believes that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expected help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Disclosed ways to recover stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in conversation with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
A portion of the savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend to start a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen while shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start a refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is placed on the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank specified.
Expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Artur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases online stores themselves return funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, director of the League of Safe Internet Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to identity theft.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders, and the situation with Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia could use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said that it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a source of contention.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position confirmed by G-7 officials on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more closely.

You have them once a year at Easter, what, wash that you have to directly launder.
Just don't let it get polluted.

Doctors warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before vaccination against the coronavirus.

He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that wealth and prosperity awaits devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery appears to be related to a theft that occurred at a Lakewood church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in a church safe, went missing.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount because the reward had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time gave five thousand dollars for the reward and later received another $20,000 as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He will receive twenty thousand dollars.
Earlier, it was reported that police had questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about money found in the wall of a Lakewood church.

A new case of human infection with avian influenza virus has been reported in China
A new case of human infection with the avian influenza virus of the highly pathogenic H5N6 variety has been reported in China.
This was reported by the radio station RTHK with reference to the notification of the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
The infection was contracted by a 68-year-old resident of the city district of Huizhou in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry on the farm.
His condition is described by doctors as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.

In Brazil, citizens were required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to demand a passport from those entering the territory of the state, a decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luiz Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons who come from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities obliged unvaccinated tourists from coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full COVID-19 protection scheme revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Worker of Science of Russia Anatoly Altstein in conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injection and use of nasal vaccine.
Internasal use produces large amounts of immunoglobulin A. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief prophylactician of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injectable vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help that in such a case the protection of the body, presumably, should become the maximum.
Earlier, Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseinov said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the kobel (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, caressing, love and games for a flowing bitch, then go ahead.

I chose my society and went home.
The video is a way that works 90% of the time.
Not from the ceiling taken, believe me.
I slowed down many owners not to run after the dog, although they owed that out, 200 thousand run away (pomsky), straight took the hand and led away in the other direction.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
Massive anti-vaccination protests continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make vaccination against kowtowing mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs reading "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covet certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the guards.
A group of demonstrators threw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe that they both deserve this title.
Here's just one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected "omicron" already in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of the coronavirus "omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has been actively distributed only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the "delta" strain, aka the Indian version of the coronavirus, which now leads in all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
This is despite the fact that officially "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom suffers several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at its peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the Omicron - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.
Why should we see the stages of aging?
It would be better to see in more detail the performance of your exercises.
It is not clear in the first exercise how to do: sitting on your heels or kneeling, as it is written, but then how to rest your hands on your hips?
Or hands on your waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, they communicate easily and casually, and when meeting in person there is nothing to say.
And to see a person live, perhaps it is not what you expected, did not catch - hence the attitude.
When you meet your person, then the views will change.
Again, the Soviet era is called "the time of demons."
Back then, people believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).

There are few chattels like the Globe of Faith (and there is none at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal house with Bolshaya Zelenina maintains communication until now.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to keep the warmth of the relations of the older generation.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and no one canceled the blockade brotherhood.
Unfortunately, they see each other more often at funerals.

$135 billion went into apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew globally by 25% and downloads by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Most users downloaded the CapCut video editor, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in applications increased even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytics company App Annie, which presented a report on the market of mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to the physical" slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the authors of the report say.
India was the leader in the number of app downloads, accounting for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of gadgets on iOS, as before, spent more than users with Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending in applications.
Among the applications, the first place in the number of downloads for 2021 was taken by the video editor CapCut.
It is followed by two Indian apps: the MX TakaTak video service and the Meesho online shopping app.
Telegram is also in the top 10 in terms of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and streaming (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, there are two other such services in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most in applications for live streaming and online streaming," the authors of the report note.
YouTube is the leader here, the top 5 in terms of user spending also includes the video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.

Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, app Maps for Minecraft PE, online taxi ordering service DiDi, client for YouTube Pure Tuber, app retailer Dixie and online store Samokat.
Around the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to life in mobile, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The biggest successes were those industries that helped people to be closer both virtually and personally," commented the results of the report head of marketing research App Annie Lexi Sidow.
Revenue in the mobile gaming sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hypercasual games, in which there is little or no story, and video design is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world were Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY are the leading games.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company's analysts named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity of Generation Z financial applications, such as Robinhood investor apps, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of the company Ivideon Zaur Abutalimova, the main danger, which is associated with the distribution of video communication tools, are dipfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Aboutalimov added that using the dipfake, the attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of the person for mailing for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, because a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Leading system engineer of Varonis Alexander Vetkol in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I was buying all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow for much coloring and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but the store WAS such a product.
In big cities and Muslim women painted, and frolics showed.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of fashionistas, but the same cosmetics are not.
Five actions to help avoid diabetes are listed
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and for nothing.
Diabetes can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by poor diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts advise to follow a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against the disease of diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to poor health over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often a "weekend migraine," said the well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the clinic of Systemic Medicine Zuhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics, who have a headache, brokenness and weakness at the weekend, are particularly affected by this.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
Over the weekend, our lives change dramatically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the sofa all day, we probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to the lack of coffee, a small break begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most over the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa claim low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South Africa announced low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the (level of) efficacy of the vaccine of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, because of which... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, - says the text of the study published on the portal MedRxiv.
At the same time, experts specified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should note that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in caloric content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other dried sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black patch), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"In 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement recording Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, within the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline so far "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers Hacked Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
India's prime minister's page has already been hacked in 2020 and encouraged to donate to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favour of the independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians voting.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as pro-independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of the independence of New Caledonia in many ways revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," repeated Eric Zemmour.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians should be the choice of France."
Light, oh, hello!
I'm a little bit... a lot of bashing, still awkward, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.
On the topic: I'm not an artist, I like to draw, but it turns out to be an inspired smear.
But as an artist - not an artist at all: what would change here?
Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity was not as prevalent as it is now.
But medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic and decoctions.
Now they would put them on their feet in a moment.
And food has absolutely nothing to do with it.
The world's first drone with laser weapons tested in Turkey

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow and made a number of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand united against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quotes one reader as saying.
"Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine's sake," said another.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Kuril Islands
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
It was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by Alexei Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA vehicles, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovic.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, which will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the fugitive lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, the people were not injured.
Experts warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a greater or lesser way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men after age 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75,000 people could die from the Omicron strain by April
Projections by British scientists show that as many as 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus, unless restrictive measures are tightened in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper citing a study by experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain, and in total will be hospitalized about 175 thousand patients.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from becoming overwhelmed if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and the current vaccines will not be able to rule out infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK's Health Security Agency informed: if the rate of spread of the omicron strain continues at its current level, about 1 million cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,898 cases of the omicron strain of the coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality this figure may already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I read it to this place:
"A coat obtained as a result of the incredible suffering of the unfortunate animal and his employment in a second job."

Demand for superyachts rose by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting the effects of climate change for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a rush on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling to space, living on yachts, or flying on their own planes causes public irritation, because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call governments to action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have stern lengths above 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Recke is building the 183-meter-long yacht REV Ocean.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas have become commonplace, and on some of them, such as wrestler McGregor's yacht - a platform for martial arts.Professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail clung to his 162.5-metre-long yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not arouse the sympathy of other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no place for their giant vessels to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is written by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they do not realize how developed four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to learn for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although the vocabulary of a dog is not as extensive as that of a human, however, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of the scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or compose poems, do not mean anything in politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions are not yet enough.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, the United States and Russia prepared to trade
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations over the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the proposer.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are carried out covertly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be discovered and deployed counter-forces," he said.
China boosts rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The core technology developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enables trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said company spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and efficiency of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed."
In May of this year, the first China-developed double-decker high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe came off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
This metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-end equipment in the global market," said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment production system, with a full range of accessories and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin in conversation with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, plan, decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most frequent causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, the study of foreign languages and active communication will help to reduce the risk of dementia.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still debated in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be seen as vision problems, which make it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia experts called aphasia - a condition when a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist Demands to Send Saakashvili for Treatment Abroad
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the consultation of doctors established under the Ombudsman of Georgia, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this is within the regulatory framework and now the ex-president must be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after he was disciplined by prison officials.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Or are we so holy that we eat prana?

These people, after all, are parasites on the body of society.
They do not work, do not pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a worker feed?
We feed all the alkalis, drug addicts, who also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then we wonder about the extension of the retirement age.
These sums could be spent on treating really sick people.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there were protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in that city claimed a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR-codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a disease, or a medevac from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and planes.

The steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create in the country resorts of international level
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will raise the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping is also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downes says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chongli, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, now none of the locals suffers without work.
More and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes open food outlets with dishes of national cuisine.
Taivu now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become the leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled human progress on universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of health services and caused excessive strain on health-care systems.
In this regard, immunization coverage has declined for the first time in 10 years, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people with little or no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcast at "Summit for Democracy" at request of White House
Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-sponsored "Summit for Democracy" was put into video-free mode, a YouTube recording of the summit shows.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the People's Republic of China, which considers the island its territory.
The map, which was shown by Ms. Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted on it in green as "free," and China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam in red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the panelists "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-sponsored "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10, with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council Yury Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we have traveled with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose approaches on Russia on a multitude of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heeded and Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of dangers of COVID nasal vaccination outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the COVID-19 nasal vaccine may develop allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sits next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is gained.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nasal congestion vaccine fades after injection.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in 24 hours - RT in Russian
Within 24 hours, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in the UK.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people became ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a pessimistic forecast, calculated that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to an outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the Rossiya 1 television channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world."
Earlier, it was reported that the US is considering the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
3.51% of residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
2.99% of ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to withdraw from the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region already held a referendum on independence.
Most residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live in the archipelago, and the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO tentatively considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines for the new COVID-19 variant.
According to information as of December 9, "omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the protein of the "omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than in "delta"," the WHO said in a technical statement.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of Omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
However, according to preliminary data, the new strain is spreading faster than the delta.
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been reported.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said that there is no reliable data yet that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko said this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the portal "Glavred."
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," assumes that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export ..." internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with key FPG (financial-industrial groups). "Ed.)," the former parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation - "a war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former backbencher, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between the population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives."
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
This could lead to an event that would be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
This scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity on Russia's borders.
Earlier, on November 11, polling data from the polling group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for former president Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of respondents expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the bakhchi and not before the beginning of August.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For the quote Yevtushenko is given 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the HSE was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetvrossiya bolshechempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police treat you during your arrest this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it sounded in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya took riot police and took hard.
They asked standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the monkey that was blown on all four sides, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag they start to write their poems, at least a few people, I will sit these 10 days for nothing.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in private at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfect Russian and nevertheless uses the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, a transcript is kept in the old-fashioned way, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, the potato helps in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and if consumed regularly, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is better stewed or cooked, rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods containing carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in personal farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.

In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, Director General of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks in part to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto," but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (filmed in the cinema pirate copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "University. 10 years later" of TNT (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.
Svetlana M., sorry, of course, but I wouldn't care if my son is offended by his mother or not.

"This idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan "The outskirts are not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, doesn't really change the point.

Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circumference, framed by "molecules" of light, ensures the most uniform and bright lighting of the space.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, does not lose relevance and allows for favorable accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.

Two were just right.
Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different soft surfaces - high stiffness and slightly more than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage."
This means that there are 2000 spirals per bed, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropackage" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks "Dimax," therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillers: combinations of coir layers and natural latex are installed at the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, because it conveys not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coir provides the correct support to the back, then latex gives adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a simple knitted Aloe Vera case.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period is 3 years.

The orthopedic foam that is used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of Venus clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of the Venus clouds.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
On the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question becomes whether it is similar to Earth's or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that Earth's life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses Will Change Russian Business
The theme of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as an extension of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in the context of a pandemic, because people are tired of disconnection and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
On the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go digital.

British economist failed to give forecast for 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless central bank largesse has outlived its usefulness" and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates will be correlated with expected GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-loose economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of global research at Discovery Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remain, with less growth potential.
Shulgin cited the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic as risks to the dollar's value.
I have to agree.
But one thing is encouraging: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, only sluggish.
There is still this problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
For 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai has an even more significant increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
On the leading position of this brand and on the increase of the weighted average price of the car - for the year Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price dynamics.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands grew less significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - on cars of this brand Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both its sales volume (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good increase in sales and weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater increase in financial capacity," explained Tatiana Arabadji, CEO of NAPI.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are performing fantastically, having also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada on the dynamics of income growth demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity are companies whose sales of cars in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in the negative - in 10 months Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickup trucks of this brand compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions that have engulfed the entire global auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last increase in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite the price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the desire of automobile companies to recover past losses, experts believe.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many car companies were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put into the price of cars before,
says VTB Capital's automotive analyst Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that, financially, the automakers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the design of the cars themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, the scope for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income from volumes, notes independent auto industry consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automobile manufacturers are striving to get the highest profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
The increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current situation in the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about US military deployment to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion."
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There were never any such plans," the head of the White House said when asked by a journalist whether the U.S. had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
Immediately I leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burda and wash another cup - it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an eucharistic layer, where you immediately talk to the manager.

If a scammer calls from such a number, such as "an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another security agency, then it is ineffective to immediately drop it, and it is likely that it will not be possible to blacklist it.
Because to confirm his lies about his involvement with the security agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
More useful recommendations for the people are needed.
That's nonsense...
I don't believe that was the case at all.
They no longer know what to think, who to blame.
They don't know what to think, who to blame.
And most importantly, in their opinion, all but the most...
And it would not be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if ours care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
As in Japan... before the elections, the influence was weakened and there were fewer infections...

As the regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of touch.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
