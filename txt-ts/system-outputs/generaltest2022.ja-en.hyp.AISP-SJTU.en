When I tried to buy an entry package, blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than double for orange.
What is the difference?
I didn't know even if I looked it up, so please tell me.
Now there should be only blue.
If there is, it may only be old products left.
Both are the same just because they look different.
Karate VS Jiu-Jitsu

Was the Destiny Plan of Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny a hit when Durandal was dumped by Talia?
Because of genetic mismatch, I broke up with Talia because I couldn't have children, so is the gene so correct?
I think the destiny plan is to pursue it, so I think there is a hit.

I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Does that mean that comedians have become impossible? TV is full of comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a lot of scenes where the staff laughed behind me when I was saying something that was not particularly interesting.
Even though it is clearly not an interesting place, it can't be helped that sesame ground laughter that "I have to laugh at everything I say because I am a selling entertainer" is creepy.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the entertainer will be in a bad mood, and the relationship with the work will be bad.
Like a black company in the past, that industry is really like a sports association, and it seems that some entertainers have too big egos and usually take a bad attitude, so you can't make a living unless you do that.
On the other hand, there are a lot of theories that "don't lick the entertainer" every time as if the entertainer himself put on the difficulty of his work.
I know that my income is quite small until I can sell it, but even if I am told that I am at the top of the top of the job as an entertainer.
It only sounds like a beautification of their own careers and a justification for comedians being too high in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is also quite difficult, but I feel that it is becoming more and more impossible to touch the entertainer world.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt like it wasn't good for me if I didn't let it out like a fart.

I was able to replace the product i ordered at the tsukumo online shop without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, and I got a wired version of it, and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
It's a mail order problem rather than a topic of my own PC, but I don't agree with it no matter how I think about it, and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It started when I found MSI wireless gaming mice sold for 3,280 yen (link gyotaku) at the Tsukumo Day sale at the Tsukumo online shop that started last Friday.
The wired version was the same price at the store, so when I checked the wired version page considering the possibility of price mistake, it was 5,071 yen (link destination gyotaku), so I ordered considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I got an order email successfully, and i got a shipping email the next day.
In these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
At this point, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive because there was no mistake or cancellation notice from order to shipment.
This is the problem, and a few hours after shipping, I got an email saying that there was a mistake in registering the product.
According to the email
The wireless version was sold at a special price, but it was actually a wired version.
We have already shipped wired mice.
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return mouse only and refund
Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose what to do.
The wired and wireless product pages are divided, and even though it is written as a wireless version in the purchase history, email, and delivery slip, it seems that he replaced it with a wired version without permission and sent it.
If you are sent something different from the product you bought without permission and you want a refund, you can return it from here.
Even if you finally accept the refund, i want to fight back one shot, so please lend me your wisdom.

Isolated twice: Typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple their food reserves Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto from the highland area of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a significant impact on the lives of eight people from three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, I was like," Are you serious? "
The only road leading to the highland area, the highland bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 residents from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry necessary supplies using JR iron bridges, which are not usually allowed to pass.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Normally, a car can come to the garden, but when you get out of the car, you can walk over the iron bridge with it in your hand or on your back, so I felt the gratitude of transportation and cars."
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to somehow secure two to three days' worth of food. "
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, I don't know when a disaster will fall on me, so I felt once again that it's better for everyone to stockpile a little."
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Director of Yamatsuri Town Education Division, said, "We have announced that we would like to make October 12 a day to think about disaster prevention preparations next year and beyond in the form of Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day.
I think we're more aware than ever that unexpected things can happen. "
Articles on purchase
The test itself is almost over, so all I have to do is write a sentence, but I am also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is wrong, so please wait a little.

Be careful when buying a used house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo!
Building condition survey system newly established to revitalize the used housing market Used housing transactions are strong.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a house has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, properties represented by soaring words such as "in front of, near, and directly connected to stations", "large-scale", and "tower" have become popular, and the number of relatively cheap new properties has decreased sharply.
[See the image in this article] However, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still low compared to overseas.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a building condition survey, so-called inspection, for the purpose of safe and secure used housing transactions (https: / / www.mlit.go.jp / common / 001219900.pdf).
Under this system, architects who are familiar with housing check the current situation, including the deterioration of the property, and the condition of the building, summarize it in a report, and present it to buyers.
MLIT explains that the introduction of inspection will benefit both buyers and sellers.
By conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase transaction, sellers can avoid complaints after delivery and give buyers a sense of security.
In turn, it will lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to grasp the condition of the used house they are planning to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and it is a system that has great advantages at first glance.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in building condition surveys.
In addition, it should be noted that only notification of the inspection system has become an obligation.
In other words, the real estate operator in charge of brokerage is obliged to explain that "when brokerage a property, we can introduce an architect who will investigate the building condition" or "we cannot", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, similar systems have already been established in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.
It is a system in which buyers ask experts called "inspectors" and "building surveyors" to conduct building surveys before buying and selling houses.
For example, in the United States, 70-90% of used home transactions are inspected, depending on the state.
In that the inspection is led by the "buyer", the nature of the inspection is very different from the Japanese-style inspection mainly by the "seller".
The seller tries to show the condition of the building as well as possible and sell it as expensive and as soon as possible.
On the other hand, buyers want to examine the contents of the survey and make appropriate repairs to live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap in the purpose and thoughts of both sides.
Therefore, the following risks have been pointed out as concerns about the Japanese system.
The scope of government-established seller-led inspections is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections will be carried out based on "consideration", such as not reporting the results of surveys that are disadvantageous to the seller.

However, I was mentally healed (?), so I was full of motivation.

It was the second time in a year, so I took a break for about a month and thought lightly that I would say goodbye to the fucking garbage company, but it was more severe than I thought and the medicine did not fit, so it took a long time.
Anyway, it's important to go to a psychiatrist to deal with it correctly and leave a history of hospital visits (super important).

Was ginza an island?
5 trivia to talk about while wearing a silver bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
"This used to be a peninsula.
As proof of that... "It is also unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia.
Here are some tips on Ginza that are interesting to know and will surely make you want to talk to someone.
Go above Ginza!?
First infiltrated Kanza.
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the history of Ginza, such as strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, and many shrines.
When I was walking around Ginza with her, I suddenly visited the silence and said, "This used to be a peninsula.
Ginza used to be a peninsula?
Ginza in Chuo Ward, Tokyo is synonymous with the downtown area that created "○ ○ Ginza" all over Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" was a silver coin foundry, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza Office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Exchange Town", but when it was moved to Kakigara Town, it came to be called "Ginza".
By the way, the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
Before the Edo period (1603-1868), there was a cove from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called edomae Island stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now Ginza.
When Ieyasu Tokugawa established the Shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the cove and developed the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu developed the block and built a horiwari to develop boat transportation.
He then cut down the soil from the moat and Mt. Kanda to reclaimed the cove.
In front of Tiffany's Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of the "birthplace of Ginza" indicating the site of the Ginza government office, so why not look for the direction you are interested in?
"Pilgrimage to sacred places" in Ginza known to those in the know
Every year in Ginza, there is a "pilgrimage to sacred places" known to those in the know called the "Ginza Haccho Shrine Tour".
Of the more than 10 sacred places, the most visible is Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za.
Many people visit the shrine on the right side of the Kabuki-za before and after the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is located on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusse Jizo" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley and are difficult to stand out, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to have been revered by famous Kabuki actor Uzaemon Ichimura.
This shrine tour includes places that enshrine Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most shrines enshrine Inari.
Inari-sha Shrine, where foxes welcome you in front of the main building, was actively built in places where there are many farmers because it has the benefit of a "rich harvest" where rice grows well.
As a result, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it came to be said that it had the benefit of prosperous business, and faith spread even in Ginza, the busiest area in Japan.

I went to the dental clinic two days ago because my front teeth hurt and when I pressed or touched them, I had a sharp pain like hypersensitivity.
The nerve was pulled out and the hole was left.
He said it was to relieve the pain as soon as possible.
I feel more pain when I touch my teeth than before, but will it go away in a few days?
The painkillers don't work at all.
After a few days, it will calm down.

South Korea's Posco International acquires Australian Senex Energy to expand its overseas gas field business (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on Monday that it has signed an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, the acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March next year, with procedures such as approval at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and approval of the local subsidiary remaining.
This is the largest global acquisition and merger (M & A) since Posco International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total amount of the acquisition is KRW 770.9 billion, of which Posco International will invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy will invest 49.9%.
Posco International explained that demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the hydrogen market in two along with green hydrogen.
With the acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local onshore gas field operators in Australia.

That knee pain may be "osteoarthritis of the knee"!?
Medical DOC - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been suffering from knee pain.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "osteoarthritis" is common in Japanese people.
Editorial Department: Does that mean that the joints will be deformed?
Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for relieving impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, cartilage can be worn out or distorted due to aging, obesity, intense sports, etc.
As a result, it leads to joint deformation and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis develop in addition to the knee?
Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur in the joints and base of the fingers of the hands, neck, waist, thumb of the foot, hip joint, etc.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial Department: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
Maruyama: A joint is an uneven combination of two bones.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped with "articular follicles".
Editorial Department: It's a complex structure.
Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the joint follicle, there is a tissue called synovial membrane that makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and consists of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee movement.
Editorial Department: What symptoms occur when osteoarthritis occurs?
Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly.
In other words, it acts like a cushion.
However, if it wears out or distorts, it can deform and inflame the joint, causing pain.

3 Gambling and Games in the Kaiji Series (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the real pleasures of this game is the extreme game that risked your life.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my legs shrug... Challenge to cross the steel frame!
Therefore, this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's game that can actually be played or practiced in the planning video.
Swamp This is a pachinko pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Breaking Record Kaiji".
In the original, it was a high rate of 4,000 yen per ball, which surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" had a large trap of "nail forest", "movable object", and "three-stage croon", which was considered almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of hands, and finally went out into the rough work of placing a vinyl aquarium in the building and sinking and tilting the ground, and captured it brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, it is not "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty level is reduced, but you can enjoy the feeling of Kaiji.
Steel frame crossing At the "Starside Party" held by the rich man as entertainment, Kaiji and other debtors were forced to carry out the steel frame crossing of the "human horse race".
Debtors compete for speed while devising ways not to fall on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people participate, and the top two win prizes, but there are only four steel frames, insufficient safety measures, and a considerable possibility of death.
This steel-frame crossing is highly dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game, and you can experience it very close at the Eagle Bridge installed at Rakuten Life Park Miyagi, the home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.
The Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and there is a single steel bridge, and "Sky Blanco" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared beyond it, and you can walk to it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi released a video of walking on Eagle Bridge on his YouTube, saying, "You can experience steel crossing in Japan."
"E-Card" is a two-player card game.
A total of 10 cards are used, including 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards, and 1 slave card, and are divided into the emperor side and the slave side.
The game is very well done, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizen, the citizen is strong against the slave, and the slave is strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji fights Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, his ears will be cut off.
In the end, Kaiji realized that a device that destroys the ear, such as an earphone attached to the ear, was reading the psychology by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and by cutting his ear to the limit and making his body abnormal, he confused Tone River and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, uploaded a video of him competing with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played Kaiji in the movie, with an e-card, which attracted a lot of attention.
Is there a way to feel like Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read manga, you can only taste the mood.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A step towards the new year, a gentle boost to the prefectural Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
A large ema (votive tablet) of next year's zodiac sign "Tora" appeared at Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), which is preparing for the new year.
Students from Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed it, visited the shrine on November 11 and held a ceremony in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has asked students of the Institute of Technology to draw original ema.
This time, Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was selected from nine people in the Japanese painting course of the Department of Art taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and 1.8 meters high in the center.
Tsuchiya says that he drew it with the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing his back as he steps into the new year.
The tiger stops and looks at the cherry blossoms with the hope that "even in a rapidly changing world, you can afford to admire the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on ema (votive tablets) distributed to the general public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

"Tamano who wants to continue living" Let's think about the proposal Workshop of 4 high school students in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | Sanyo Digital
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are jointly working on a workshop to think about "Tamano I want to continue living in".
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center, an intermediate support organization, the project will summarize the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answered "when they are excited with many people" and "when they are playing drums".
It was first held on November 13 at Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
18 high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns," "comfortable towns to live in," and "towns where they feel a sense of purpose in life" using the method of "World Cafe" while moving around "islands" with their own themes.
Each idea is written down on sticky notes and pasted on imitation paper to organize it.
"A town with many young people seems interesting," "Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
We will discuss further whether there is anything in common.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but it's attractive to be able to cycle along the beach," says an 18-year-old Tamano Commerce and Industry High School student.
A third-year student (18) of Binan High School said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but the place rich in nature is good," and by talking with adults, they seemed to notice not only the local issues but also the charm.
At the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the recommendations.
The mayor and superintendent of education will be invited to make an announcement in February next year.
Rie Higashi, president of the center, said, "We hope that it will foster high school students' love for their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to take the initiative in urban development."

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It is an indispensable stole in winter, but do you have a time when the cloth leans around your neck?
After winding it, it is good to balance it while looking in the mirror, but sometimes I hear that I do not know the trick.
I thought it would be nice if there was a stole that could be wrapped quickly without the cloth leaning back, but I found something novel.
The stole of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, making it more compact than ordinary ones.
When I first saw it, I said, "Can you wrap it so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is made into one piece by knitting a long and narrow cut cloth, and the whole is like a net.
The edge of the stall can pass through the net.
Therefore, it can be wrapped and fastened without connecting the ends.
Made of fleece material, it is very light and warm.
This year, gilets (vests) without sleeves are popular even in jackets, but many people wear them in combination with stoles so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I think it will be convenient to have such a stole.

The beatles documentary on disney plus is super interesting.
It's called get buck, directed by peter jackson.
It's like a life-size Beatles, and it's a lot fresh...
It's just before we broke up, so we're giggling, but it's not the dramatic giggling we imagined.
Paul, who is annoying like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" While trying hard to partition, George, who is lazy like "But", John, who is late and unmotivated while saying opinions and jokes relatively calmly...
We don't hate each other enough to fight like that, but there is a great feeling in the atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and the Beatles were like that.
And even in that atmosphere, when we started playing, everyone was really talented.
It's a bad process to end up with that masterpiece while we're doing a little phrase and saying, "How about this?"
Especially the moment the title Get Buck is made is amazing.
It's amazing that the scene where the casual humming gradually becomes that mess and the lyrics enter is firmly recorded.
It's amazing that you can't see the composition process like this.
Also, of course, everyone is fat, so you can be happy just by watching the performance scene.
It seems that it is still one of the three episodes, but so far I have the impression that the biggest cause of the dissolution was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them seem to be having fun when they start writing songs while complaining about something, but when it comes to what to do with the live place, it was easy to understand that producers and publicity people like "The Beatles are the best in the world!"
Well, the documentary also has the director's interpretation, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, paul seems to be supervising it, so i thought that might be why paul has a lot of bad scenes.

I think it's hard to live a little now.
I am from a sales position, but I was sick enough to die and changed jobs, but at that time I was not good at doing sales activities on my own, but I thought that it was very suitable for sales activities that customers needed, so I chose such a job in a different industry and changed jobs, and it became very easy to work.
I was told what I could not do, but if I can find what I am good at and what I can do, I think that my future way of life will be a little easier.
Of course, I think that it is okay to think about this after resting slowly and relaxing your mind.
However, I think that there is also a daily life, so if there is a company union, an industrial doctor, or a contact point where you can consult, there may be some system if you consult there, so I think that it is a good idea to consult once.
I hope I can live with a comfortable feeling in the future.

Tornadoes and severe damage in the United States (Weathernews) - Yahoo! News
From the night of Friday, October 10 to Saturday, November 11, local time, tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern United States.
It is thought that the atmospheric condition became very unstable due to the influence of strong cold air moving south where it was record warm for this period, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature rose to nearly 30 ° C on Thursday, 9th and Friday, 10th local time.
As a result, a large temperature difference formed an active front, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly along the front, as strong cold air below -30 ° C moved south near 5,500 meters above the sky.
It is believed that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in one day in the winter, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday, October 10 alone.
According to this, there are two main concentrated areas: The southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of tornadoes, reached EF3, the third strongest of the six stages, and it is believed that gusts of around 70 m / s blew instantaneously.
Depending on future investigations, it may be determined to be EF45.
In Japan, based on the improved Fujita scale, JEF (Japanese version of the improved Fujita scale) is used according to the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, is quite likely to occur in Japan, and it is at the level of collapsing wooden houses.

"The Greatest Tornado in History" - Yahoo! News
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history."
CNN TV reported.
"The federal government will do everything it can," Biden said.
"We do not yet know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he explained.
The death toll was feared to exceed 100.
More than 30 tornadoes struck at least six states, including Kentucky, from the night of October 10 to the early morning of November 11.
A record 219 miles (350 km) of tornadoes hit Missouri and other states in 1925, but CNN weather experts estimated that this was the largest tornado at about 250 miles (400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas sales season was also severely damaged.
At the time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace.
In the dark, a woman stuck under debris about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of rescuers searching over the debris and asked for help via a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also echoed screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You", which another woman appeared to have sung while crying to distract her fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, hid in her basement with her five-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrible sound like something spewing out of the earth," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police officer said, "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months or years it will be. "
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead after a warehouse of Amazon collapsed.
The train derailed due to the impact of being cut off, and the highway was blocked one after another due to the impact of falling cars.

It's hard to get welfare...
I'm praying we can do something about it.
If you have a "live-in job" like a ryokan or resort part-time job, you can secure both an address and a source of income, but in the current social situation of the coronavirus pandemic, it seems that there are few options.
It seems that there is such a site for the time being ↓
Live-in Part-time and Full-time Jobs - Live-in Job Navi (Suminabi)
There's a related search for live-in work with translation, so many of my colleagues seem to be like that.
It seems that bank accounts and line contracts can be managed if you have an address only for the first time, but credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards) can not be renewed without an address (because a new card will be sent to the registered address)
What does a gynecologist mean?
A "specialized doctor" is a doctor in his 35th year after graduation.
It is also called a "major doctor" or "late-stage resident doctor".
In other words, "residents" are "initial residents" and refer to doctors in the 12th year after graduation.
Speaking of immaturity, I am immature, but in my fourth or fifth year, I will be able to provide some medical care, so I will be entrusted with various tasks.

It has been a discourse for a long time that the way of thinking about the star system evaluation system is different.
In other countries, points are deducted based on five stars, while in Japan, points are added / deducted based on three stars as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have a completely different meaning between "there is a point deduction element" and "it is not a masterpiece but an honorable mention".
If you use 5 stars as a standard, "works that only have no shortcomings" and "works of the highest level in everything" will be on the same line, so if there is such a tendency, I think that it is a defect in the system that does not present the meaning of stars, but since such operation is actually carried out in such a system, I want you not to give 3 stars (bad reputation).
So if you try to refute people who insist on this kind of discourse with Steam's two-choice evaluation, the story will not work.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB that can insert a general hose size?
The capacity of the power supply that can be taken from USB is about 2A at 5V, so it is at most 10W.

Self-made radio volume
I made an am radio with my own capacitors and coils, but there was a lot of noise and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I heard the sound of the radio, but I heard a radio that was different from the frequency I tuned.

"Fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce" of "hakobune" | Life and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun Live
Lunch box "Fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and fried shrimp Homemade tartar sauce"
"Hakobune" is a takeout specialty store that specializes in colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) using plenty of vegetables.
Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year so that people can enjoy the feeling of a restaurant at home.
One of the popular bento menus is "fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
I choose the best fish at the market.
Takayuki says, "I make the raw bread crumbs as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients for fried shrimp," and you can directly understand the plump texture of fried shrimp.
The lunch box comes with about four kinds of vegetables and deli to garnish, Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture, rice with millet, and soup.
The vegetables are homemade in the soba field and purchased at direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki has trained in French cuisine, and lape and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, it is a mixture of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with "a familiar and relaxing taste" like dashi-maki eggs (Yumi).
The bento box "Domestic snoring meat tegone hamburger steak" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the company will also release a charcuterie set, a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcohol.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport, and there was something interesting, so I used it.
Ride comfort is not that bad, but sometimes it shakes (not enough to get drunk)
It's fast, of course.
Safety When there were people around me, I slowed down, and in some cases it stopped completely, so I think it was safe for the time being, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
The eyes around me hurt, it's good to be seen, but it hurts to be seen as if it's a hindrance, my heart hurts.
Overall review Not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It is a pity that it will be easier to use if there are a little fewer people or consideration such as having them come to the edge.
Specifically, I thought we should create a dedicated lane so that it wouldn't get in the way of other people walking.
But I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little fewer people because it was relaxing and I could relax while looking at the scenery.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you had a very patient heart, where the excitement of the near future and the pain of the surrounding eyes were comfortable, wondering if this kind of autonomous driving would become mainstream in the future.
Damn it, i was embarrassed.

If you look closely, you may understand a little, but Ese unadon does not use eel at all.
It's actually eggplant! (Tap it to get the right answer)
I like eel, but in fact everyone is eating it with sauce, and I thought that the eel part is actually anything other than the degree of baking... I thought that the texture and volume of eel are quite important.
I didn't want eel to be extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.
Recipe used: EGGPLANT "UNAGI" - Woks of Life (Sansho pepper instead of green onions).
I just baked the steamed one in a frying pan with sauce, but it takes about 30 minutes.

A family's long way to take root in environmental protection activities on the Chinese frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato, Corporate Consultant, Find Asia, Hong Kong) China, which has a vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, and it has the largest variety of mammals and the third largest variety of plants in the world.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists as well as environmental protection carried out by local governments.
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such area.
Sisapanna is an area bordering Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Thai" people who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flows.
Sisapanna The area of Sisapanna is only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of wildlife and 20% of plants.
This time, we met Mr. Min Lee, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and talked about the contents of the activities.
Starting environmental protection activities with my German husband - I heard that it has been 20 years since you started environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li Our environmental protection activities "Heavenly" started in 2000.
It was my husband Josef Margraf who started it.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It is the only rainforest area in China and boasts one of the largest biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was also lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale logging of rainforests has progressed in the past in order to establish industry in this area and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and study biological resources.
Then he got to know me, who was a reporter here, and got married.
Before that, did you have any interest in nature conservation?
Lee I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who have an aura even though their faces are not in place or they are not particularly tall. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said, "I'm sorry.
Aura is not something that comes out with the intention of coming out.
It comes out naturally the moment you have confidence in yourself.
I'm sure that person has a solid confidence inside.

I suddenly think, is it fine to say that the other person's clothes and colors are good?
It's not detailed, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it's detailed.
I have never been praised and told that it is detailed, so I don't know what it means.
I wonder if he praised it in detail.
What would you do if yokomine sakurasan confessed?
I reply, "Sakura confessed to me, my heart is in full bloom in spring, please do it too."
And in order to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account. If I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to open it?
If you open it at the same time, the procedure will be completed faster.
Now it takes about a week to complete.
There is no fee, so we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

[Omakan / Personal Memorandum] MOD What is the cause of CTD in your own environment and took about a month and a half to identify
Stable data until March CTD due to multiple factors has occurred while I do not have much time to play since around GW, and it took a lot of time to identify it if I examined it little by little only on holidays.
Why didn't .Net Script Framework parse the logs (and you'll know in a few minutes)? Some .dll series and mesh-related errors are not left in the crash log.
Timing of the main CTD
All papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins that leave logs do not leave footprints.
Note: When some NPC kills / attacks accumulate: Also activated by console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / powerofthree SE update re-opening) Improved by OFF * Is there a possibility that this is wet?
Basic improvement: Setting conflicts related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
(Basic outdoor) During field movement + some magic (e.g. ice runes) activated, when NPC hits: Dirt & Blood v2.0 SPID use NPC application settings (upper right of MCM) All turned off and all improved in five consecutive attempts.
In addition, the default .ini using SPID in 2.0 has a formatting error, but as a result, it should be the intended result and the premise Perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking by falsely accusing part attacks and onhit-related motion / battle mods (.dll ones), but the result was like this.
I don't think there were similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French levels.
If there are people who have similar CTD problems in the Japanese environment, I thought that it may be helpful as a memorandum.
Everyone is doing it with a mental state of the last minute
People around me don't notice it, not only my colleagues but also my family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that he is working well even though he seems to be hard.
But perhaps he is also mentally at the last minute.
I didn't retire in the name of mental health, but I think it was the limit just before retirement.
What do you think about the importance of psychiatric home care?
I have bipolar disorder, so I have been receiving home-visit nursing for a long time, but I have a long relationship with the nurse (female) at the home-visit nursing station I am currently using, and I think I have built a very good relationship.
We talk about various things every week.
Of course, they do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but above all, today's home-visit nursing made me realize how important fun communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, we talked about gender differences between men and women, or rather, we discussed gender theory.
I also talk about the sexual desire of men and women, why she divorced, and whether it is okay to visit nursing.
Sometimes I dress as a woman.
However, I have heard from an acquaintance that in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only provides administrative support, or an occupational therapist comes for home-visit nursing and gives instructions from above, such as "I am doing medical care".
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think that it is a really good nurse who faces me frankly on an equal footing with me who has a mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing, and some of you may be thinking about receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very useful for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves it, you should definitely take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I had to cancel my contract because I couldn't get along with it.
I'm sorry.
I know it's a fake warning, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are a few things that may be the cause, but for example...

Korea's hydrogen technology patent is one-fifth that of China... "delayed in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (Chuo Nippo Japanese edition) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap.
The plan is to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price is 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations, which are the core infrastructure, is 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is well below the target value.
The National Federation of Business Professionals (Zenkyoren) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem" on December 12.
According to the report, most of the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (United States), Goa (United States), and 3M (United States) supply membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative).
However, the Federation of Economic Organizations said, "In effect, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually lower than their competitors."
The order of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the United States to number one, and the gap has widened.
In 2020, Korea ranked fourth with 1,033 patents registered, surpassing Japan (974), but 22% of China (4721).
"Hydrogen technology should be designated as a" national strategic technology "with a large tax credit for capital investment and R & D expenses," the Federation of Economic Organizations proposed.

Because it's free competition, for example, if a branded product is more rare than the list price
For example, it's legal for a painter to become famous and the price to rise.
The fact that PS5 is sold at a high price is also a rarity, and it's only worth more than the list price.

Congress on sunday?
Creating a flyer like a TV program Parliamentary reform is underway in Takasu, and the "correspondence book" of members is also available: Hokkaido Shimbun Dojin electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as creating unusual flyers to guide regular meetings and introducing a "correspondence book" where townspeople evaluate members.
The town council election has not been held for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to attract interest from the townspeople.
About 1,800 new flyers were distributed in newspapers on the 9th to inform people of the Sunday Congress to be held on the 12th.
"Raw gillon from the morning", "Tetsuko's room", "Sawaguchi Hitoshi exploration series"....
The flyer distributed by the town council to all households on September 9 is reminiscent of the names of popular TV programs.
"I want you to laugh and come to the parliament," said Hyoe Katayama, 43, a member of the Diet who created it.

U.S. aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine by Monday under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million, and the last equipment, including four mortars and other radar that identify launch sites, will be transported to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
The aid also included lethal weapons such as the javelin anti-tank missile, according to U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kirby.
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to Russian military buildup around the border with Ukraine.
The United States has been vigilant about Russian military movements and is in talks with NATO members to develop countermeasures in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Biden approved the weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine and Crimea, the total amount of aid has amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian forces.
Last month, the US sent the Florida National Guard in accordance with a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, US special operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a secret matter of operation.
Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, but there were also tense exchanges in the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The future of the "review" of inheritance and gift taxes that "prohibit" living gifts hits Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of Weekly Diamond was "Talk with your family during the year-end and New Year holidays!
It is a living gift and last-minute inheritance technique. "
As discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax progress, it was postponed in the outline of tax reform for fiscal 2022, which was a concern, but there is a great possibility that living gifts, which are the royal road to inheritance tax measures, will be "prohibited" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In addition to directly hitting Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives and a former chairman of the LDP's Tax Commission, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax saving techniques for a profitable last-minute gift in time for the end of the year.
(Hiroaki Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
"From the perspective of more integrated taxation of inheritance tax and gift tax, we will proceed with full-scale consideration toward the establishment of a tax system that is neutral in the selection of the timing of asset transfer."
A sentence in the outline of the fiscal 2021 tax reform announced by the ruling party last year caused major unrest not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what he is trying to say is to completely change the rules of inheritance and increase the inheritance tax by "prohibiting" "living gifts", which are the royal road to inheritance tax measures.
The iron rule of progressive inheritance tax saving measures is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation".
Living gifts, which are the strongest trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by office workers who incur a small inheritance tax due to their homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
Under such circumstances, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" came up.
Although it was postponed in the outline of the fiscal 2022 tax reform announced on December 10, when there were concerns about the fastest introduction, a policy for integration was renewed with more in-depth wording, such as "reviewing the current inheritance settlement tax system and the calendar year gift system" and "gift tax exemption measures are a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit..."
Akira Amari, former LDP tax research chairman and former secretary-general, told the editorial department.
"The most important thing is to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of property transfer and keep the tax burden the same whenever you go.
At present, we are simulating what problems will arise (due to integration). "
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future, it will make a big cut in the direction of nullifying living gifts as tax saving measures.
So how will the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

The FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Hanazumi Yamatani as the heroine Based on Mori Satoshi's manga of the same name, which has been serialized in Kodansha's BE LOVE since 2018, this work is a pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the past.
The main character Umi is Furukawa, and the heroine Riyo is Yamatani Hanazumi.
Riyo, a university student, meets Umi, a senior at her part-time job.
Umi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows Riyo's shoulder for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Umi, who looks like her brother, who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but for some reason Umi may be a murderer.
Comment from Yudai Furukawa The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial from January 10!
If you could not see it on FOD, I would like you to look forward to it, and if you have already seen it, you will know this work more deeply if you can see the complex psychological depiction of Umi and Riyo, and the state of the two people who struggle and change after knowing the development.
I hope that fans of the original will also enjoy it.

Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in the game.
This was the lowest pass in the NFL in 50 years since the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
In 1974, the Bills had an unrivaled genius RB named O.J. Simpson, who was the first player in history to exceed 2,000 yards in the previous season.
The Bills overpowered the Jets with a run by Simpson and another running back, Jim Braxton.
The weather was the main reason why the Patriots developed such an extreme offense this time.
Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido in latitude.
On that day, the temperature was about 1 degree Celsius, the wind speed was 18 meters, and the snow was blowing before the game.
The Bills did not change their play choices much because they were local.
He has 30 passes and 25 runs.
Allen passed 15 / 30 for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, and it was never a failure.
In the 10 offensive series, there were four red zone intrusions and a scoring machine.
In particular, after the end of the third quarter, he advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, he was only able to score three points in the FG in three times.
Defense before the goal at the end of the game.
After four points, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd & 9, resulting in 3rd & 14.
18 yards to the goal.
In the 3rd & 14, QB Allen flowed out of the pocket and to the right, surrounded by a rush from the Patriots defense.
He then threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was outside the right, ran shallow across and was free in front of the end zone, but Allen did not seem to see it.
On 4th & 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from outside the left, but his pass failed when he was hit by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front.
Bryant covered Bills WR Cole Beasley one-on-one, but saw Allen move along the way, released Beasley, and responded to the pass.
Allen missed the two receivers and threw passes for the end zone both times.
The fourth down pass may have been a decision, but the third down did not have to aim for a TD.
You can take the first down in two plays.
It was only two minutes before, so if it was 4th & Short, Allen's ability to run himself would have lived.

3 items that tend to be placed in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's Bazaar) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, you probably don't change it as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researcher who did the study recommended changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that cutting boards should be replaced if they begin to wear out, scratch or groove.
This is because once wounds and grooves progress, it becomes difficult to keep them clean and bacteria grow.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect it frequently with a solution of 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water dissolved with a tablespoon of fragrance-free liquid bleach.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and leave for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and dry naturally or pat with a clean paper towel to drain and dry.
Chipped or broken tableware.
It can be heartbreaking to dispose of your favorite mug, but the missing surface becomes a new hotbed for bacteria and bacteria.
It can also cause lips to be cut with the missing part and drinks to spill.
Yes, it's your chance to buy a new mug you love!

Flashbios doesn't end, help me.
I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X, so i replaced it with a B550 and a Tomaho that i bought in september.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted it, the white cursor-like dot on the black screen did not flash and it was in a state of receiving all the time.
If you try to rewrite using FlashBIOS because you think the BIOS is corrupted, it does not end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it takes about five minutes, but it doesn't end in an hour.
The possible reason is that the usb drive i tried is too old and the one that converts and uses the sd card.
You're sleeping too much, and your tomaho is crazy.
Is there any other reason for that?

If it is inconspicuous, you can hold it, but you can not hold it with Lv written in a monogram like Vuitton.
Why is that?
I think it's good that it suits your length.
By the way, I think it's good in Japan.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
It's better to say it early, "Why am I the only one who calls me?"
So it doesn't matter because you are a foreigner? It's better to simply say that it's uncomfortable.
I don't think he ever dreamed that he was uncomfortable with a good chance.
I was living abroad on the way, but there were a lot of Japanese people who came outside because they didn't like the Confucian customs above and below, including me, and I misunderstood that I could say anything to the locals.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you do it with a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling without pure evil.
Even my friends from Europe and the United States call me by the name below, but when I speak in Japanese, there are moments when I am a little confused about which one to choose.
Well, if it's a friend, it's still fine.
I guess I used to do it purely normally, but if I overlook it, I may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because it is Gaijin, so I should say it now.
I was wondering if you could talk to me according to japanese rules because it's japan.
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always make a glass higher than other younger people when they toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do that, you can't be strangely naughty by younger or older people, or you can be treated like a Japanese person.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, have people who look at such details (including me).

50 subscribers Thank you!
When I opened Reddit today, this sable I just made exceeded 50 subscribers.
I am very happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little more until 50 people went, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today alone, so I am very grateful.
If you subscribed to this sable today, I would appreciate it if you could tell me where you found this sable in the comment section! (I don't know, so I'm really curious)
I am the only person who is currently making a thread, so I would be grateful if everyone could make a thread.
It will be encouraging if you make comments without sulking.
Maybe Reddit is used, but few people use twitter.
If you are using twitter, please make a thread!
Last but not least, thank you very much! The sable I made before was frustrated immediately because people did not gather as I expected, but this time it seems that I can continue without setbacks thanks to everyone.
I will do my best to make the sable easy to use by maintaining the wiki and rules, so thank you for your continued support!

I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, I feel that it is a person who is well translated.
I think that if you are not a native Japanese speaker, you can understand the detailed nuances of Japanese even if you study for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people do not feel uncomfortable with, you should look for someone else.

Consideration "The blade of demon destruction" training is battle.
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human hymn (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent boys' manga, "Demon Slayer no Blade" is particularly different because "there is a lot of training".
In most cases, there is no battle, and it is an established theory that the training edition that trains even after the end of the day is not popular with readers.
Even in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Crew were separated, they had two years of training, but they drew only the touch and skipped the rest dynamically.
Well, one of the charms of One Piece is the eccentricity of the land where you move, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
It can be said that the training of Sumjiro, the main character of "Demon Slayer", began when he sat down to Tomioka Volunteer, who saved his life, and begged Negeko for his life, who tried to take his life, and he was told by Volunteer, "Do not let others hold the right to live, kill, and take away!"
The weak have no rights or options, they are all screwed down by the strong by force....
While saying that, it was the kindness of volunteers (and the poor community who do not explain their intentions) that introduced Sakonji Rintaki, a "educator" who trains those who wish to join the demon killing team.
The first contact between Sumijiro and Rintaki is asked, "What will you do when your sister eats a person?"
At first glance, it is an unreasonable exchange of stories among fans.
However, taking her sister, who has become a demon, has the possibility that the moment may come when she will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that it is an initiation to enter training from the attitude.
However, Rintaki takes Sumijiro, a total amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air in the mountains is thin and full of pitfalls, trebuchet and traps, so you will die before you start training.
Even so, it is barely "main character correction" to smell the faint smell of traps set by human hands with his sharp sense of smell and somehow avoid them.
Even so, "That doesn't mean that your physical ability suddenly increases enough to avoid all of it!!"
Ordinary people do not suddenly become strong without any support, and the only thing that awakens is that they can use "the power and skills they have honed so far" with their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of efforts", which rewards those who make efforts as much as they do and does not reward anything for those who do not make efforts, is a human hymn different from demons with unfounded paranormal power, and it is a hard-to-move rule consistent with this work.
Is this old?
It is not a bed yet, but a way of sleeping that lays a mat directly in the house and sleeps on a futon or quilt.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you use a large room, it is better to lay a futon and sleep than a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Is it a mess?
If you work part-time and want to work full-time, are you frustrated?
No, I don't think so.
In such a case, it does not fall under the "gametsuki" I think.
I think that it is "gametsuki" to plan to somehow get more profit than effort with minimal effort.

Samsung Electronics Korea Establishes DX Division to Integrate Home Appliances and Mobile (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of CE and IM divisions as a set division, Samsung Electronics decided to name it DX (Device eXperience), and announced on December 12 that it will reflect this in its organizational reorganization at the end of the year.
It can be read that the purpose is to strengthen the user experience through various services from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the DX division, which was newly established by integrating CE and IM divisions, will consist of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), household appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
"This name change reflects our medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening global leadership," a Samsung Electronics official said.
It also emphasized the intention to make it easier for consumers to enjoy optimized experiences through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones and communication equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership system, the name also reflects the strategy of creating company-wide synergies across organizational boundaries and building a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through interlocking devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (Iot) and artificial intelligence (AI).
So 1500 bce is bc?
What happens in Japanese?
It was 1500 BC.
BC means Before Christ, but in recent years, it has been increasingly written as BCE based on the idea that there is consideration for non-Christians.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

Do you think there are any stamp shops that do not sell shachihata?
It is located in the neighborhood.
I specialize in hand carving.
Well, if you ask, they will order it, but I think they will ask you to go somewhere else.
You can buy shachihata cheaply online.
I bought clothes at h / m and set Yamato Transport to receive them.
If you receive a shipping notification, it means that the store has shipped it.
Also, if you have stopped Yamato Transport's sales office, it is closed as it is.
It all depends on the counterparty, but I have used Yahoo Auction! And paypay flea market several times, but there was no trouble.
I have also used the buying and selling thread of 5ch self-made boards, but there is no trouble here (only one purchase)
You can see them on twitter looking for buying and selling.
I have no choice but to choose what to do with what to do in case of trouble and compensation...
I have someone I want to get along with.
How do I get along?
Let's talk to him.
After that, I think it's a good idea to try to get along little by little.
This is Empire of the Undergrowth, right?
I also supported it on kickstarter and made it into Japanese until the middle, so I recognize it.
There is also a problem of taste, but I don't think "desu / masu style" fits a natural science documentary narrated by a low-voice man.
I want it to be heavier and more formal.
They lie, jaws primed, with only their armed heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is spared and dragged below.
The alum larvae ambush their prey with sand to catch it at any time, showing only the disk-shaped head from the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
The larvae of the alum ambush in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, and only the disk-shaped head can be peeked out of the sand.
I think it should be.
And what i'm curious about
Did you refer to other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from an ant's point of view?
Is it?
If you translate armoured heads as disc-shaped heads, I think the part that "on the scale of ants, they are giant beasts wearing helmets" will disappear.
The 24-car crash trailer driver is careless without chronic illness (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It was an accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, and the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor did not have any chronic illness, and it was found that the accident was caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of October 10, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided with National Route 41 in Komaki City, causing minor injuries to 12 people.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, 54, who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of injuring a 71-year-old man in the first rear-end collision, and sent him to the police on the morning of December 12.
Nomura's trailer continued to proceed without stepping on the brake even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura did not have any chronic illness and it was found that it was caused by some carelessness.
The police are searching the homes of the people involved and investigating the situation in detail at that time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-News) - Yahoo!
The 20th superhuman Olympics, which started with volume 3, are completed with this volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which drew everything from the opening to the semi-final at once, it is full of new tricks because it focuses on only one game!
"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review Author Oginuma X ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (5 out of 5 stars) Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the game!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are carefully and carefully depicting the final between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that they are not just about the game on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, it is difficult to go to the game because it is different from before, such as the battle of keeping each other and the special training scene, but it is not boring at all.
This feeling in the work, where the tension of the first battle of the century is gradually increasing, is definitely connected to the increase in the tension of the reader, and even this period is really calculated.
And before the important final, another mountain that should not be missed is the third place decision match between Terriman and Ramen Man.
Not only is it gorgeous as a match card, but what I like is that the ramen man behind the scenes before the game turns to the Kinnikuman poster and says, "Now it's my turn to aim!!"
And try to hit the chop.
However, Terriman, who happens to pass by, accepts the sword and stops it, glances at each other silently, and the place breaks up just by that.
What's amazing about this is that both have already lost, and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.
But there is such agony over that kinnikuman.
If I can show you this, I can't help but think about my activities in the distant future!
As a manga artist, I am still keenly aware of what it means to have a character!
The battle between the two ends without much time, but the famous scene is the appeal of the ramen man's tears after the game.
"Don't rely only on the strength of divine luck!!"
It is a line.
This is already a grand meta-statement about the work itself, and I think that readers have felt that Kinnikuman does not lose because he is the main character in the end, and that he has somehow won in a place that is not his ability.
However, by having the ramen man make this statement, the boiled egg teacher stabbed himself that he could not use that hand anymore.
In this word, the reader said, "Well, Kinnikuman will defeat Robin with his ability?
How?
You will be able to stir up your imagination again by the uncertain development, and from another artist's point of view, this is a line that is as good as the boiled egg teacher who creates the work imposed restrictions on himself.
I thought you did something amazing.
I think it is definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Aobayama, Takahama-cho (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is wrapped in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illumination, which started on November 26, is studded with 50,000 LED bulbs along the walking path and lawn, including a 20-meter-high camphor tree.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time and was surprised that there was such a place.
It was very beautiful and I was relieved. "
The illumination was planned for the first time to feel healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5: 00 pm to 8: 30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25.
On the last day, the 25th, there will be a Christmas event such as a button pot behavior and a movie screening.
I think there are only a few people who can read through the documents in order.
I had a friend who could read a lot, and when I asked him, he was a person who could do it, but he was firmly solidified from the basics of Linux, and I read the table of contents in reference books rather than documents and read from where I was interested.
(In fact, it is easier to apply and understand if you learn from Linux rather than suddenly touching something with a high degree of abstraction like docker.)
It is quite difficult to pull out that and suddenly understand everything.
I hope you understand.
You don't have to do it in order.
Also, I don't remember the contents, but I somehow remember what I skipped before and read it when I need it.
I didn't read anything and suddenly broke it in practice and then read it repeatedly, so I gradually started to read it.

Online distribution, PR of agricultural and livestock products Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, broadcast from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
The Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities and JA in the Okitama area, developed a PR activity for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce", which sells products while distributing videos on the Internet, on November 11.
Yamagata Ai no Busho-tai and others appeared remotely on the "National Collaboration Minato Market TV" planned for the first time by Minato Ward, Tokyo, and delivered the charm of the region along with specialty products.
The opening of the store was decided by the "Okitama × Minato Port Opening Project", an initiative in cooperation between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, and it was broadcast from Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "satoyama sommelier", wears a stole from the Yonezawa weaving brand "nitorito" and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
He also delivered the Imoni-kai with the Busho-tai of Love.
At the studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and YouTubers with more than 300,000 registered users tasted Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, etc.
When I told the audience about the deliciousness, comments such as "The smell is transmitted even though it is a distribution" and "There are many delicious things in alcohol and it is the best" were exchanged.

I was unhappy this morning...
My NAS PC won't turn on anymore.
What happened?
In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is energized.
After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from my PC, and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought that the fan was only moving poorly due to the drop in room temperature (6 ° C).
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3.) Do not start.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on for a moment and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I won't say anything.
Unplug the power plug and try again, but it still turns on for a moment.
Connect only the motherboard and ATX 20 pin and 4 pin, remove the other parts and try it, but it does not start.
5.) I suspect that PSU is the cause because PSU fans have been hitting something for a long time and there has been a buzzing sound.
I will find the surplus ATX power supply at a later date and try it.
Maybe.
If not... what should I do?
I'll change the case and mother together.
