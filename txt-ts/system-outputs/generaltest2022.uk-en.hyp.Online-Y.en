Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, will stop beating - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äî and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the deoccupied territories.
Direct speech: ‚ÄúMariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights ‚Äî we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city - ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the Joint Forces Operation, and if they are stronger, then the table of negotiations will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these areas, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to return even to the cities that we have now deoccupied.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and may not even be interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory...‚Äù
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but ‚Äúwe should not miss the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them.‚Äù
Direct speech: ‚ÄúPeople will perceive peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something ‚Äî and I do not think that they will be satisfied by any peace under any conditions.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or end in millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight ‚Äî but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust, when there is nothing, there are no people.‚Äù

We promised that when you went to school, we would bring you a surprise.
Bulob is wonderful, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of brutal mockery of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century? How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. What happens is exactly what I was sadly waiting for...
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for a moment did not doubt that in case of occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communal-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in Zhytomyr.
Several years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU gave a copy of the execution case of his great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor ‚Äúone-yard‚Äù gentry, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was sufficient to dend the plowman and feeder of young children to death.
Relatives did not even know about the place of burial.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village then and all but two were killed, who agreed to give perjury.
In the criminal case there is the name of the knocker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KDBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree is not far away, as you know, falls...
The three who condemned the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources like ‚ÄúImmortal barrack‚Äù, qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDIst found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers ‚Äî the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems on the computer found files with child pornography, for it put in prison, and there already quickly died.
KDBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16-19th centuries were superimposed on top of the millennial Horde tradition.
And then over what happened, made a brutal genetic experiment, carving out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film ‚ÄúChekist‚Äù in 1992, so it was.
So you saw my photos in a swimsuit

According to Evropeyska Pravda, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also howitzers in option on the armored personnel carrier Boxer for 1,2 billion euros are offered.
While tanks in combat have to pick up relatively close to enemy targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Is this us in the first half of the day, or in the afternoon together?

Maybe I can be something useful for them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to tighten up mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we have to work out with Kolya so that it was without errors.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also very much hope for this
And so she is very happy about any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...

So you leave the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass execution by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke about ‚Äúthe common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äî it is also part of our responsibility related to our history.‚Äù
If ‚Äúthe evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue.‚Äù
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of its blocked cities and lets them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass executions of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles executions in Babi Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans have seen it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany delays delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But ‚ÄúNever again!‚Äù means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against massacres, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song to you at no time
We agree, agree for the tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sydorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents supported.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in the Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the outbreak of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens ‚Äî more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance provided by NATO in the context of war, there is now a lot of criticism about the Alliance and member-countries ‚Äî for the late supply of weapons, refusal to close the skies, and the reluctance to ‚Äúirritate‚Äù Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast ‚ÄúDamn Questions‚Äù, together with the editor of ‚ÄúEuropean Truth‚Äù we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, and why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history and why security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think that here
I have a volt partner indicated that my application is pending.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back again and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then after a while he called that he had had heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to him, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During this time we talked a lot.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I wondered, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: they say ‚Äúthey haven't done this before‚Äù
Konashenkov's direct speech: ‚ÄúWe see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously refrained.‚Äù
Russians struck missile strikes to Kiev from the first days of full-scale invasion of occupation troops of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles that were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower on Dorohozhychi near Babi Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by were killed.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying towards the building of the Ministry of Defense over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed rocket of the invaders crushed the house and the trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it is too early for residents of the capital who were evacuating from the city to return.
Military explained to local authorities that Russians still can strike rocket attacks to Kiev, and besides on suburbs of the capital there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to carry out a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod said that a ‚ÄúUkrainian shell‚Äù allegedly fell near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians of this.
And these speeches, this refined fusion of strength, touching and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine's accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I do not want to be considered fraudsters.
The funds that you collect, it is better to give to people who are more in need.

They are heroic leaders who go to the war zone without fear, calm and help refugees in cars, and help volunteers to load humanitarian aid in the cars at peace stations.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhitomir highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are housing and communal services who under attacks take out garbage, repair water supply systems and power lines to provide people necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (HEI of Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad, [footnote 1] on which there are Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo). [ 1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas constituency is performed by the Central Election Commission.
Only national elections are held in the Foreign constituency: elections of the President and People's Deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.

The head of the President's Office, Andrei Yermak, said that Russia is launching a ‚Äúfake operation‚Äù on weapons handed over to us by the Allies.
Yermak's direct speech: ‚ÄúThey understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to ‚Äúknock down‚Äù the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the destruction of the S-300 SAM systems transmitted by Slovakia.
This information was already denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers seem to surrender with weapons from allies, and it is massively switching to the arming of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively send the enemy to the next world.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these messages as ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù.
‚ÄúReports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are condemned,‚Äù New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
‚ÄúRussia must answer the world for what they have done,‚Äù she added, noting that its government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida called the incidents ‚Äúa violation of international law.‚Äù
Statements were made after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops committed ‚Äúwar crimes‚Äù in Bucha.
‚ÄúWhat happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,‚Äù Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez said that Russian troops can go so far that they committed a ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in Bucha.
‚ÄúWe will do our best to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,‚Äù Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry's Foreign Ministry's speaker Maria Zakharova rejected the accusations as a ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO ‚Äúordered‚Äù the image to discredit Russia.
‚ÄúIn this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who ‚Äúordered‚Äù this story,‚Äù Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is ‚Äúanother statement of the Kiev regime‚Äù and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called ‚Äúprovocation of the Ukrainian radicals‚Äù in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement announcing an ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù on charges of spreading Ukraine ‚Äúknowingly false information‚Äù about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
‚ÄúI want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,‚Äù Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back of the head,‚Äù he said.
He declared that the president of Russia Vladimir Putin and the Russian military have to bear responsibility for actions of troops in Ukraine.
‚ÄúWhen we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand,‚Äù he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers north-west of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small town bodies like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw on the street up to 10 bodies.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people ‚Äî all in civilian ‚Äî were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
It looks like the victims were killed at close range.
In total, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything according to the list.
‚ÄúThey were told: There is no Kiev.‚Äù How invaders sneakly exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item in this list, about which there is currently much less information ‚Äî the removal of local population to the enemy's territory.
Since mid-March, Russian occupiers have been ‚Äúevacuating‚Äù Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military training ground.
‚ÄúUkrainska Pravda‚Äù found the exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same ‚Äúevacuation‚Äù is going on and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text came to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian swimming champion Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the airport ‚ÄúAntonov‚Äù, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina in advance collected alarming suitcases, but in the morning of February 24 did not have time to evacuate.
The car in them wasn't, and suburban buses already took nobody.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the next house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
‚ÄúAt 6 pm on February 24, people who spoke not in Russian and not Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask: ‚ÄúThere is someone?‚Äù ‚Äî I say yes. ‚Äî ‚ÄúCome out!‚Äù.
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All men were interrogated, whether they served in army.
Women were told: ‚ÄúWe came to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov.‚Äù
It was the Chechen riot police, not even troops, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: ‚ÄúHere we were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bely (commanded the detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO ‚ÄúViking‚Äù, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we came to help you.‚Äù
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that water, it was a big problem.
They broke shop, took away from there goods under the pretext ‚Äúall the same Russians will take away‚Äù and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the looting of the store and say: ‚ÄúWe understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich.‚Äù
Nobody really wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, ‚ÄúYou have 7 days to give our phones‚Äù ‚Äî they laughed.
They also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was they who came, because they did not want wars, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: ‚ÄúPutin is a freak, Kadyrov, too, but we can do nothing because our families are there.‚Äù
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
The chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other ‚Äî their white scotch tape and called it ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù.
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us: ‚ÄúDo you have artillery?‚Äù
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments - the Chechens did not know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out if their own or someone else's.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses ‚Äî ours constantly got into it from Bayraktarov.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there is ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù, and, according to them, ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative ‚ÄúKyiv has already surrendered‚Äù has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Somehow a Russian came to us ‚Äî either an officer of the landing troops, or a representative of the FSB ‚Äî and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio ‚Äî there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought maybe we were given a ‚Äúgreen corridor‚Äù.
From the very beginning we handed over to the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: ‚ÄúYou are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov.‚Äù
We say that we do not want neither there nor there.
To which they answered: ‚ÄúPity the psyche of your children!‚Äù
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house ‚Äî either Gradami or mortars.
And then it flew back... The neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that this is for traitors of the homeland - they say, ‚Äúyou will be shot there, they will sell them to the authorities.‚Äù
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnout, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians told that the Russians immediately took out the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint ‚ÄúKomar‚Äù we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned down.
We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! The rocket shoots, and you can see a trace ‚Äî it worked ‚ÄúIskander‚Äù in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, ‚ÄúNo, these are planes flying, turning around at the border.‚Äù
But we are from aviation, we have an education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded on a bus and taken to the sanatorium ‚ÄúChonki‚Äù near Gomel.
His leader, Vasily Stepanovich Venger, came, said: ‚ÄúHere, I'm a crest, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these of your theirs are finished.
Poorish people are suffering!
And Lukashenka is so good at us!
He will say so.‚Äù
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: ‚ÄúYou are already traitors!‚Äù
And people from the Red Cross and the UN Mission (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents - my daughter did not have a passport.
We had it on Monday to receive, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will tell that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.
In sanatorium force didn't hold.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äî UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who took the bus in Mozyr, told that Russians there constantly shoot from landfills.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was being brought in.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, ‚ÄúYou lie, we are peaceful people.‚Äù
They do not perceive that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.
Friends were waiting for Poland, who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are now, probably, as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian ones.‚Äù
Marina lived on the territory of a military camp in Gostomel together with her brother's family ‚Äî his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able to ‚Äî the house is no longer there.
Anybody really knew nothing about evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center you can not?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you to visit!
Thank you for the agreement, the moths are beautiful
And in this small apartment does not catch wifi, basically I answer all your questions and now I do not know how to be? And children from Monday classes online, but there is no Internet.
That is, I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is it a family ready to receive us?
In the Qur'an it is written: ‚Äúeven a leaf of wood falls from his knowledge.‚Äù
Children are trained online, I am a seller and cook by profession, but I can work in the field and a cleaner that is, a handyman, Mariana an eyelash extension specialist, she can work at home, and the friend Mariana has no specialty, that is, a handyman
Can you agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoliy Fedoruk said the good news - the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day invaders were thrown out from all Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found killed and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor - in the sewer.
The bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found on the sides of the road 20 km from Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go there will be no one at home

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He told about it in interview to the Associated Press which excerpts were published by Office of the President, writes ‚ÄúEuropean truth‚Äù.
‚ÄúAll the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it is done too late.
So what, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,‚Äù Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president answered: ‚ÄúNot yet, not yet.‚Äù
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different look.
‚ÄúIt would unfold differently, we would have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,‚Äù he added.
Recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer

‚ÄúFor a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law information about the war.
So far, it succeeds.
However, Plamka (cat - UP) has fur on the belly and hind legs - this can be due to stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, alas.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.‚Äù
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and most of the time spends in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her ‚Äúincognito‚Äù for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
‚Äú33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was near - formally came as usual for several hours.
But when her girlfriend spilled out, I gave her the receiver ‚Äî she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.‚Äù
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time mother-in-law spends in her room.
Hears badly ‚Äî it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her ‚Äúwalking‚Äù, I was hiding in my room.
The first thing I hid from her receiver and TV.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
I asked to talk to her about anything, but not about war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It was April 17 - I have a cleaning of 2 apartments:)
Good evening, I did not think about it somehow:)
Hello, if tomorrow we will need our help we can come
Lunch must be ordered, is it possible to take lunch from home? These documents need to be printed, whether they will print out there on the spot and I will sign?
I offer haircuts for men, women, children with a trip to you, all marked please write in private messages, the price:
I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation, I will still look here.
I tell you embassies there are only here,
Briton, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton who is a serviceman of Marine Corps brigade of Armed forces of Ukraine participating in defense of Mariupol told his friends and family that they will lay down arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter page of Adin Aislin, a British man who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, BBC with reference to family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News referring to the words of Aislin's friend who spoke to him
Literally, Eislin's twitter: ‚ÄúWe received the news from him: ‚Äú48 days have passed, we tried our best to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.‚Äù
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Journalists of the Air Force contacted the mother of the serviceman Anne Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son said that they plan to surrender.
Military friend Brenan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about the plans of their unit to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of the Atlas News outlet contacted his friend, who said that Aislin's unit intends to surrender captive to Russian units, so as not to get into the hands of the so-called ‚ÄúKadyrovites‚Äù detachments without weapons and bullets.
Also, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was distributed on social networks, in which Aislin allegedly talks to his friend, an American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company ‚ÄúVagner‚Äù.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to fight against terrorists of the so-called ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äù in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Eislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
A very interesting tradition you have, we go like this at Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, entitled ‚ÄúOn monitoring potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere‚Äù.
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the field of economy was... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine's national security.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that has a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear ‚Äî it is an excellent basis for ‚Äúdemolishing‚Äù all the assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establish manual control.
The one that was before 2015.
Why state companies have supervisory boards and who should enter them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law ‚Äúflies‚Äù under patriotic slogans, others may take off tomorrow ‚Äî for example, the public procurement system can be demolished through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the war and draft law 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people's deputies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will analyze the arguments that explain the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide the offers how to resolve an issue of management of state enterprises during war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, and therefore the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the members of the supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, it will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which lasts 3-4 months on average.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from losing the opportunity to make decisions, but rather, on the contrary, will lead to this!
MP, author of the draft law Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of him.
In particular, he notes: ‚Äúmany enterprises, in particular the defense industry complex (defense industry), are now in need of relocation‚Äù and therefore ‚Äúit is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna via Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information‚Äù.
To begin with, in Ukraine there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in ‚ÄúUkroboronprom‚Äù, in accordance with the law, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All the fullness of power in ‚ÄúUkroboronroma‚Äù belongs to the CEO, who by the way will make a decision on the need to relocate a particular defense enterprise, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry at all.
Mr. Dmytro also gives arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as ‚Äúemotional‚Äù.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to sort out some of them: ‚Äúrespectable foreign experts at the first word ‚Äúwar‚Äù leave Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war.‚Äù
Firstly, it is manipulation ‚Äî most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they ‚Äúleave Ukraine‚Äù, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of conducting online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
Nor should we forget that membership on the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just means of electronic communication help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshhorod and Buchansky districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, will introduce a tightened curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: ‚ÄúIn the settlements of Brovary, Vyshhorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.‚Äù
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to travel by transport and on foot.
Residents can go outside only during an alarm to go to the shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äî to clear and clear the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas so far to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget for several years in a row grew exponentially.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the Russian Federation's full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took seriously the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: ‚ÄúRadyo Svaboda‚Äù, human rights center ‚ÄúViasna‚Äù, chief of criminal militia of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich who quotes state news agency ‚ÄúBelTA‚Äù
In the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30 with power support of special forces of ‚ÄúSOBR‚Äù three inhabitants of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to ‚ÄúVyasna‚Äù, during detention men showed active resistance and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were provided with medical care on the spot.
The chief of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that ‚Äúacts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will rigidly stop‚Äù by security officers using the weapon.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsky branch of ‚ÄúBJD‚Äù and the administrator of thematic resources ‚ÄúBJD‚Äù in ‚ÄúVKontakte and ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki‚Äù Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at least 40 railroad workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of ByPol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to commit sabotage at the railway transport facilities and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
Belarusian ‚Äúrail guerrillas‚Äù thus try to resist the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring manpower and equipment to Ukraine to fight.

US bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the US financial system and prohibit US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
‚ÄúThis step is based on the decision adopted by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law and consulting firms,‚Äù the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new US sanctions was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these entities and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including Russian ex-president and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin
Sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.

Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a little information from Mariupol for the son - live and in a system.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons connections
Natalia Nagorna, a journalist of the 1+1 TV channel, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was given to her by the military of the 36th Marine Corps Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to participate in battles, and a mountain of wounded people.
They said that ‚Äúthe bill goes for hours.‚Äù
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate Marine Corps Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could become the last battle for defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command didn't contact the fighters for two weeks.
Social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyi assured that there is a connection between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers in the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dumped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù Andrey Beletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is held by fighters of the regiment ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù.
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same, so far we stay here

The squadron of Czech üá®üáø drones from today began flights over Ukraine üá∫üá¶.
Almost 50 professional copters üöÅ will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader üí•.
Two Zakarpatye and two Czech brothers ‚Äúbirds‚Äù to Ukraine sent the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends headed by the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones to their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where fighting is currently ongoing.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters, we will leave their locations secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say that in the coming days many more interesting ‚Äúgifts‚Äù will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

In Kherson, the invaders made fun of the memorial ‚ÄúGlory to Ukraine‚Äù in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown people broke the flag of the European Union, destroyed the panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The invaders tore the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Demolished the flag.

Headquarters report: Russia prepares provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine ‚Äúof aggression against a neighboring state‚Äù.
Literally: ‚ÄúIt is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state‚Äù.
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for actions in the Slobozhansky direction.
Allegedly, in the next few days, invaders will try to resume offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Armaments and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent location of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the losses of personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel are recruited from the brigade.
The enemy experiences a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected staff from point of constant dislocation is planned for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt delivery of goods to places of warfare, will continue blows to objects of transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine for the purpose of their destruction or disabling.
The identified units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and Coastal Forces of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
By forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of the settlements Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and moved to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Gold, had no success.
In Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopole, Trudolyubovka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Do not understand your thoughts?
Of course, we will try to make it, but I doubt
And you can do you want to sleep and I hold you
You definitely do not mind, that I came?
maybe you just have no desire to see you today, then tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and especially 1+1. We do not need to set up:)
I will turn on the TV here solely to listen to the Czech language
I have a monthly tariff package expires today:)
Can we do that today on the phone?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little ashamed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, be sure üôèüèª
I read the ad on Facebook, then apparently Google wrote something in its own way üèµÔ∏è., I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we are things that you brought, but there are things that are small on us, can you bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the Labour Office to submit documents (if it works, because there are very long queues) and on Saturday it is raining:)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream to work for Tevi
Friends are old and not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I've been in touch with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you run away from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is being exposed on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from ‚ÄúMemorial‚Äù.
I will tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha answered laconically. - Now after the search we go through the ruins.
Others ‚Äî cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äî are amazed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
Neither of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of very few of you ‚Äî those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduga, Navalny's organization, and a number of other places ‚Äî have many of you done at least something to resist this regime?
Except unless participation in meetings when they still occurred.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist ‚ÄúIt's too late to hide, too late to be silent‚Äù
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive compassion, which now, probably, have a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you, to a certain extent, possessed freedom and democracy ‚Äî disorderly, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not the best year in 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, you end up being overwhelmed by such a strong fear of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems to you that it is safer near him. Why so?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as did the Germans from the Stasi, you took your soul at the monument to Dzerzhinsky ‚Äî and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, renew, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were confronted with the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option ‚Äî and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya again with the ground, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
At that time, I worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin's ‚Äúanti-terrorist operation‚Äù, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurt, Itum-Qali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and at times I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the children killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me: ‚ÄúBrad, we are already tired of your Chechnya.‚Äù I remember these words very well.
In response, I was indignant: ‚ÄúFriends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your power bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.‚Äù
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to make good money, some got rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired new housing and found a better job.
Prices grew, but is it a trouble?
Moscow festively shone and shone with chic.
When several oppositionists ‚Äî Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovska, Oleksandr Lytvynenko and others ‚Äî were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, it did not go further.
When after two terms Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev, and he took the place of the prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev's rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or kept silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if we did anything at all.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what significance did Russia blatantly violate international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, this was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again exchanged places with Medvedev and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massively went to protests.
Navalny's name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that he struck back.
First, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received huge deadlines.
‚ÄúWhat could we do?‚Äù
I've heard it so often and I've heard it so far.
‚ÄúThe state is so strong, and we are so weak.‚Äù
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan ‚Äî and never left it.
They completely independently built a tent camp and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
In the end, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do not do their job well.
Putin did not like the Maidan very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general dismay, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.
From somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his band suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find the reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
‚ÄúWe are not interested in politics,‚Äù you said.
And you new hid in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, completely new after the restoration, which began the mayor of Moscow in 2012 - with their binbegs, public wifi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äî and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and myself saw how on the streets of Homs state snipers coldly shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all Russian citizens, only your soldiers visited there, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Surely many of you know the words of pastor Martin Nimeller:
‚ÄúAt first they came to the Socialists, but I kept silent ‚Äî because I am not a socialist.
Then they came to the union members, but I kept silent because I'm not a union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I kept silent, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say something in my defense.‚Äù
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did that.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really speak now ‚Äî like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new GULAG or form a company for Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians ‚Äî or, what seems very likely, if he does not succeed ‚Äî he will take over you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously, but for the most part alone, went out to protest and still took place for a short time, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for an anecdote, are not in such a distant past ‚Äî and now they are very likely waiting for you in the future.
Who then will speak out for you? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians ‚Äî even more than in 2014 ‚Äî frightens Putin's regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war continues in general.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be on the alert.
You understand what everything is going to.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just hochma, your laws, apart from the repressive ones, are worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no longer present, your economy collapses faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad. even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him what he wants, you can try either go somehow or you will be crushed.
I doubt that you see another option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the prevailing conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not break out from you: due to the economic collapse impending on Russia, it is likely to catch fire in the province, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies in itself, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
It will be necessary to organize and coordinate. The crowd will need to be turned into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool ‚Äî the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be debugged in almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
You are very many, millions of you.
The Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very high.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be in your place, too, afraid.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat ‚Äî and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet ‚Äî and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake ‚Äî and die in a damp cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äî and will only continue to grow, gaining more and more scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act cold-blooded, strategically and achieve that to become a reality.
We were on Friday in class, we were told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be
That you perceive me as a press secretary
