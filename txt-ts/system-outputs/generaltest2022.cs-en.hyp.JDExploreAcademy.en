Pavel Francouz called up to NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon find himself in goal.
The former goalie of Litvínov, Pilsen or the Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was substituted in the middle of the game against Vegas and has not appeared in an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, US time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
The graduate of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems his senior year and didn't play a single game in the pandemic-shortened season.
In the NHL, "Francík" has played 36 games, and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles masks up Camilla for Christmas card as William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wishes public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camilla to put on a face mask at the races.
The British news broadcaster BBC reported this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress, as is Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk for a Christmas card photo.
The heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, have also published a picture that will serve as a Christmas card.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at Ascot in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and face mask, helps Camilla put on her mask, which is colour-coordinated with her light-coloured dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied this.
Prague - Detectives in the current corruption case allegedly worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz reported on this, saying that it had gained access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red-and-whites did not commit any corrupt practices.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, figures prominently.
According to the file, the former influential functionary of the red-and-whites was in frequent contact with both Berbra and the former sports director of the then second-division Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The detectives were reportedly working with information that Slavia had promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the first league title.
The police had information that Roman (Berbr) had been promised a million-dollar bribe by officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal actions, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by a police operation in several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, in mid-October last year.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer involved in any football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, as was the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping the cold war.
The cannons will be new, but basically inferior (gunners have to carry the cartridges manually, without cover, from an armoured cabin).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already been possible to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. Gemini Man with Will Smith did not disappoint the critics
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith confronts his younger version in the film. According to critics, however, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is at the top of his profession. He kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. One day, however, he decides to hang up his career. Understandably, his employers do not like this and send another killer after Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or more precisely, his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined person win the battle over himself? This time literally.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a guarantee of quality. Although this is his first sci-fi, he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters worked on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first reviews, however, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Even if Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan from Screen Daily.
The Hollywood Reporter's Stephen Dalton summed up his opinion: "This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved, with a weak script and plot held together only by the filmmakers' technological wizardry."
"Gemini Man is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly dull action film," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge does not hide his disappointment.
"A muddled product born of a bizarre idea," is how IndieWire's Ella Kemp summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care about one man being another man's doppelganger when neither acts human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
I have a story.
I have a hunting ground just outside the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before anything came out, but of course, after a while, the fox came.
I let it come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a trick.
By the time I got down from my perch, it was gone.
I.e. even a meadow can be prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So put your valuables in a visible place at your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.

The Ministry of the Interior procured respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for professions most affected by the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their purchase in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for a respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
An unusually open and unique portrayal of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature documentary
This unique film by Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would like to make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I did not hesitate for a minute! It was and is a great honour for me to film with a man who has remained in the limelight of Czech culture for more than half a century thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable hard work. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, who has brought joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, the first day of shooting took place on 22 October last year and the last shots with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to authentically capture Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who has been giving joy to several generations with his songs for sixty years, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and actually all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film, The Gott Phenomenon, with this current one. Everyone is different. At least by the fact that we filmed them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, almost intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed for all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The filmmakers captured Karel Gott at his performances, at meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team, so that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about quite intimate topics. With her husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, they actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But because I still had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot for as long as possible. Well, and because there was a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it would be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and everyone who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself about the film.
I respect soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the ČSLA, which the older generation experienced), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stocks of equipment that could be used by the trained, we don't actually have modern equipment even for the current professionals, moreover, modern technology is more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-train someone.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct a mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be waged in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the authority has allowed. But there is a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorised the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other hand - subject to the fulfilment of structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition," said the spokesperson for the Office for the Protection of Competition, Martin Švanda.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, XLCEE-Holding owns the Möbelix stores. If it were to absorb the Kika chain, it would occupy too large a share of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it must sell part of the acquired company.
XLCEE-Holding is also buying Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be approved by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is second only to the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged since 2013 to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings. It faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Along with IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner is the Möbelix brand. After the takeover of Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will operate more than 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).
We don't have reliable reproduction, but we don't need to scare people.
Some words have ominous connotations, even though they only convey the state of affairs. One of them is the word "one-child." It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," is said, without anything needing to be added. It is interesting that "one-child" has carried this trait since time immemorial, from the days when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today reaches this value. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the simple reproduction rate of the population is not guaranteed by European states. (In the West, only Israel with a total fertility of 3.1 children per woman is out of the question.) It is a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Maláčová falls for it: "There are almost as many one-child families as two-child families," she said in an interview with LN. However, she omitted the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem, rather than downplaying or ideologizing it, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children is easily labeled as fascism (in the style of "even Hitler supported it"), it is good to recall that many couples directly plan to have only one child, and it is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak extension of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies), but despite all this, let us draw attention to one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many one-child families," there is a bit of demagogy in it. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let's recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to a terrible 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is still not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. They can only reduce the alarmism a little.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis by buying 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion Czech crowns) 6,000 former social apartments that the city sold 15 years ago. It is responding to public pressure, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rent prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher from the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such purchase in the history of the German capital. The opposition is criticizing the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give security to tenants," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally handle the rent freeze," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Thomas Rothäusler, an analyst at Jefferies, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing units were overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation with their actions. The FDP stated this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money."
As early as mid-July, Gewobag won back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not published by the council at the time. The dispute over the apartments on the former exhibition avenue from the GDR times was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the difficult situation of tenants in large German cities, the paper wrote.
The German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents, but it has become more attractive in recent years. According to the AFP agency, rental prices have doubled over the past ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
We just don't have the individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
This then leads to a situation where you look like a dude who missed an empty net two minutes ago, driving into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss players, and you say to yourself "wow, and what do you think will happen now?."
Well, of course they're going to recruit him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "tackle the defender" skill is so terrible that I found myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker was able to beat one of the opposing players.
Wife swap: Parents cruelly abused Ondru! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve-wracking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father at every moment. "He came home from school and lied about having a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in Výměně. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondřej to kneel in a corner for several hours! In addition, off-camera, he had to suffer like this on a wooden mat to massage his feet! "Ondřej came to me after the shooting and told me - aunt, I'm only making these troubles and notes so that I won't be here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the door of the studio apartment. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after the shooting and placed for a month in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I arrived home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we had received the money. I almost did not respond to that. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in the institute, that he was then returned to them, and now he is in the diagnostic centre. They are both unemployed," says mother Lucie from Pilsen.
Blesk, of course, also contacted the other party, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," Aneta said and hung up the phone.

Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1,038.45 points. It was driven upwards by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and the media company CME did not do well. This follows from the results of trading on the stock exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually finished with a small profit. "Nevertheless, for the whole week, it (the PX index) lost slightly more than one percent," said Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to 803 crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to 72.80 crowns. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to 113 crowns and the operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to 216.50 crowns.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to 294 crowns. The tobacco company Philip Morris gained just under one percent, with its shares rising to 13,640 crowns.
The securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
Three titles were loss-making - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and the insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies, losing four pennies to the euro to 25.85 CZK/EUR and three pennies to the dollar to 23.62 CZK/USD, according to data on the Patria Online server.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will continue for some time and, as is known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity gained from previous experience of the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected silver lining entered the COVID equation this week: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovide from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape in the first place also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in these studies is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not share their opinions openly.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown."
See, you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist animals.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and a media lynching.
Then it looks good in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France that Le Pen and Zemmour, according to the poll, both have over 20%.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables will open the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and the two winners of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the award for directing and the jury award from Cannes and much more will present the 6th year of festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and inspiring things presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes festival. The film is a French candidate for the Oscar. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally introduced by the representatives of the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit, the actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-author of the script of the film.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
After its success at Cannes, director Ladj Ly's directorial feature debut was screened and awarded at a number of other world festivals. It won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award at the Durban IFF, and was also screened at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo, and will soon be screened in San Sebastian.
As part of the festival, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, The System Breaker, Farewell, My Son, Sorry, We Missed You, The Ghost Town Anthology, and The Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will be distributed in the Czech Republic: the sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, and the Czech triumph of The Painted Bird.
We even know that there are three completely identical buildings in the Czech Republic.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to learn where everything is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One of them is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether for reasons of security or the speed of deployment of warheads due to its more westerly location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire missiles, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some kind of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a dilapidated state.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
On 27 September 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It is a very moving place," said the Prime Minister, accompanied by his wife Monika, as he placed a white rose next to the names of Lukas Rambousek and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 people killed in the attack by hijacked planes on the former pair of skyscrapers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, in their place there is now a memorial with a list of names of the victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the USA on 11 September 2001 was described by the Prime Minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. At that time, in addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the building of the Ministry of Defence in Washington and were planning another attack on a target in Washington, probably the White House or Congress. However, this plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"That is our main enemy, and that is where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," the Czech Prime Minister added.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, and we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he came often and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he came regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or telephones, he came cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in the countryside, he did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully he never got into any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, gypsies, started in the same grade, different class.
Shortly after that, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to trick me with the price, communication was easy.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself.
I say of myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves as he should in a decent society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But if someone comes, stretches out a hand, inhabits flats and houses, has nothing but a mess around them, causes problems... then it doesn't matter what colour they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate with us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons that have not yet been established, drove into oncoming traffic on a bend.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where post is often free," says the collector.
Since October, it has become slightly more expensive for him to order small consignments, he now has to add VAT and submit data to the post office for customs clearance.
He gets an e-mail saying that customs is expecting a package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of incoming mail from abroad at the international post office in Prague has fallen from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
According to Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did it on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Strict, but fair, he entertains us for hours! This is how the grammar school students in Benešov see their favourite teacher and writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. The high school teacher of Czech language and history is also a poet, a prose writer and a rouser of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind when thinking about Pavel Hoza's texts. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitewashed country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and the people who have walked them for centuries. Mourners, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor to Reynek teaches Czech language, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs an equivalent of the Prague Viola in the local Café na slovíčko and organises the Benešov Literary Festival every year.
Tackling inflation
According to the headline, how would you suggest dealing with the current inflation?
Inflation is currently at 9.9% and is expected to rise further.
In your opinion, what should the state do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
In Poland, for example, we are seeing a reduction in VAT on food and fuel, is this the way forward for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable about where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get as a bonus (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% to my gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while I am employed.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
A vote in the upper house of the Canadian parliament confirmed a rumor that has been circulating for several days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the fight for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for her efforts to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title because of her participation in the genocide against the Rohingya minority.
The decision to strip Suu Kyi of honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," independent senator Ratna Omidvar commented on the decision of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada - especially as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of the long-time human rights campaigner to the atrocities that the army of Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been committing for endless months against the Muslim Rohingya minority is unbearable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently reported by the United Nations. In particular, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, as the report says, "shock both the horror of their actions and the enormous scale." Suu Kyi and her administration, according to the UN, committed complicity primarily by covering up the actions of the soldiers and releasing a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation."
With Suu Kyi's removal, five figures remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th imam of Shia Muslims, and Malala Yousafzai.
The Canadian Museum for Human Rights has also reflected on the development surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy, adding information about the atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of her honorary citizenship to Suu Kyi's profile. "We have also dimmed the lighting of her photo on the board depicting the timeline of the fight for human rights, and we are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quote museum spokesman Rory McLeod.
The only thing that will remain of Suu Kyi in the current turmoil - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. "Even though Ms Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," the head of the Nobel Foundation, Lars Heikensten, told the Canadian CBS.

The Attorney General has resumed the prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
The Supreme Public Prosecutor, Pavel Zeman, does not agree with the acquittal of the mother, who has been manipulating her daughter for a long time and disturbing her relationship with her father. She was facing charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The Regional Court acquitted her of the charges, but Zeman does not agree with this. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, similar behaviour can be seen as a criminal offence.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary from the point of view of regulating further application practice," reads Zeman's appeal.
Last year, the district court in Svitavy initially found the woman guilty of mistreating a person entrusted to her and endangering the upbringing of a child. She created a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized because she threatened to self-harm if she was placed in the father's care.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offence. The regional court repeated the same verdict even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to decide again.
The regional court stated that situations where one of the parents manipulates the child towards the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in custody proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth welfare authorities. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.
According to the Supreme Public Prosecutor, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangerment of education. "The accused acted quite purposefully when she aroused negative feelings towards her father in her daughter and purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. By doing so, she not only pursued the unlawful intention to restrict or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must have been aware that she would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once again to the regional court. The appeal implies that the child is now in the care of the father.

Can someone explain to me why proven rapists are only sent to prison for six months?
It just boggles my mind how a court can send an animal like this to prison for only 6 months, only for him to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victims from reporting?
The first Miss Christ finally came to her senses: She lost a few kilos and immediately saw through
The first modern Miss, Ivana Christová (49) from 1989, had problems with excess weight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly psychological ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. Now, however, it seems that she has taken these criticisms to heart and has gone into battle with her extra pounds. Even if it is a long-term battle.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered even Paris. However, thirty years have passed since then and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to the strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as thin as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in whatever she wanted.
But she went from going on hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. She also tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose-fitting clothes, which, however, added even more dimension to her plump shape.
Now it seems that Ivana has really come into her own. She has visibly lost weight, and has begun to dress tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
At the launch of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75), she surprised everyone present by once again showing the features of the charming brunette, who in 1989 made history not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will always be the first beauty winner, but also the very first to whom the spectators at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled like mad when she put on her crown.
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has postponed the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was 20 September, said the spokesman for the National Park, Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is the reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price that we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, then the work will begin as soon as possible," said Drahný.
As opposed to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have the selected supplier of the construction part by the end of last year and to begin construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, the European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not at risk.
The KRNAP administration has not been able to select a construction company for the repairs of the museum. A second tender was announced this summer, because in the previous tender, all bids from companies significantly exceeded the then expected price of 65 million. Bids exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since the autumn of 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor centre should be built in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the conversion of the exhibitions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway to the Krkonoše for visitors. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Krkonoše in the clearest possible form and motivate people to discover the mountains and their protection. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer the possibility of organising concerts, festivals, theatre performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a café.
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob unintentionally helped officers to secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He had called them to her.
But he did it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In reality, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
After checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we have not been Slavs ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague for the USA:')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit will not be punished
In criminal slang, unexplained cases are called "monuments." However, they are also investigated if new information comes to light years later, especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley, which was 12 years old at the time. "A case from 1955? That would be difficult, very difficult. For a start, it would be necessary to find the file, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovič.
Under the previous regime, the public was not informed much about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," thinks the criminologist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Tech firms want to rule our cities
In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, the political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, we are witnessing the triumph of illiberal models and various forms of nationalism and radicalism from the United States to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to come to terms with the emergence of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is reconsidering many of his former positions: he claims that the ideas of socialism should return to the public space and that Marx was right in many respects, although he also insists that his development of thought is still in line with the position of the nineties and that the critics of The End of History and the Last Man did not understand correctly.
"What I was saying back then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, who don't see the point, and therefore group themselves according to an identity that gives them a sense of belonging."
At the time, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about the ownership of the means of production, then, except when there is a demand for clear services to the public, I don't think it will work. But if you mean redistributive programs that try to solve the huge imbalances in income and wealth that we are witnessing, then yes. I think not only could it come back, it should come back. The long period that started with President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the advantages of an unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many respects."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm down the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
Even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
In such a case, would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of the thousands of gods and having the one true god, whom I just missed, send me to hell or some similar place?
Nečesaný wants 45 million from the state
According to the spokesman of the office, Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has so far received six requests in this connection and is now analysing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the justice system finally acquitted him.
Neither the Supreme Public Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Králové Public Prosecutor's Office charged the then twenty-year-old grammar school student Nečesaný. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times on the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, and her life was saved by doctors from the Hradec Králové hospital.
Nečesaný denied any guilt from the beginning. "I am innocent and I swear to it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the injured party, but I am not the perpetrator," said the young man in court earlier, who did not deny that he was in the hairdresser's on the fateful day. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him that she was already closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser initially did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later identified Nečesaný as the assailant. According to court experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court handed down five verdicts in the case. First, it found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison; the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Nečesaný was sent to prison twice, but each time he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After the ordered replacement of the court panel, there were repeated acquittals, the last of which was confirmed by the High Court in March this year.
However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but that he did not have a better option due to the procedural situation. He said that he rejected the public prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict, even though her appeal objections were justified.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence has been collected in the pre-trial proceedings, which would be more than enough to find guilt in another criminal case," stated Lněnička.
However, both the Hradec Králové and the Supreme Court looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change if the acquittal was overturned.

I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.

All components of the Czech Army could do with something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
Let's put it this way: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and a kind of intermingling is taking place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or Mongolian invader will ever invade here again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if the shit hits the fan.
Well, bless her heart.
All it takes is one election in the US to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that all they have to do is turn their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military technology of its time.

Kovosvit is selling the administrative building and other halls. It expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, with a consolidated turnover of 1.3 billion. Kuchař ranks the lack of workers and shifts of subcontractors among last year's main problems. This year, the demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decline in turnover by about ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and plots of land, which it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, to make its activities more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of a momentary solution, whether it is, for example, cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan, when we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
Kovosvit exports roughly half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Kuchař ranks India among the most interesting, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth 30 million crowns to China. "Another order of the same volume is being negotiated, which we would like to fulfil before the end of the year," said Kuchař. On the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May, it delivered another machine, and it is expected to deliver another one at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2020.
The company's main investment this year was the switch from steam to hot water heating for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for grinders of castings for the foundry, machinists, lathe operators and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. At one time, the company had up to three thousand employees.
Leonard Cohen's final album to be released posthumously
Thanks for the Dance, which will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son, will be released on 22 November.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the individual songs. In the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began to work on the material left to him by his father. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate with him - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas and singer Beck, to name a few.
"When we created the music for my father's words, we used his own characteristic musical methods. So he is still with us," said Adam Cohen about the album. "What impresses me most about it are the reactions of those who have already heard it. One by one, they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his characteristic honeyed voice. He sang about death, he suspected that he would not live to see the release of the new material. He admitted it in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You unwrap the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home inundated with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Upon agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue bins.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, since the price of packaging cardboard has risen by 50% in the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filler material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of cartons.
We will use everything to pack shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tyres, used electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste are gradually increasing," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection process. The law can be circumvented, says the opposition
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said the chairman of the ODS parliamentary group, Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes that are intended to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics speak of tobacconists - in state-owned companies in the future. Newly, applicants should go through a selection process at the ministry in question and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to excuse themselves by saying that the selection committees are to blame for the possible poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding for the minister. The amendment still has to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Rather, I find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app, or indeed mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem and folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend - it starts in January - and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, in the street - and mentioned so many actions that they cannot be done in half a year.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, who straddle the right and the left, agree on little, but they do agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be a new presidential election in April.
The electoral calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't they be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened teacher, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress Jasna Duričová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was at the top of the audience rankings.
Anthony Hopkins won best actor in Berlin for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than the regular flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I don't claim that everyone feels this way)

Kristýna Plíšková didn't make it to the finals, her second title still eludes her
Plíšek's surroundings in Tashkent were telling; in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit here, and this year she performed with great aplomb.
After wins with Paoliniová, Kawaová and Kužmová, she fought her way into the top four players.
However, the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck took an early 3-0 lead and Kristýna did not manage to turn it around, although she did manage to convert one break point. In the last set, she fended off one match point, but the end came at the second.
Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
An undated photo shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The purpose of the fortifications was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance until the Allies could intervene.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have knocked the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not have been any of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses - due to blisters.
Zeman as a preservationist - A man stretching the constitution calls for the enforcement of the law
Anyone who moves in a society divided into camps and doesn't want to go completely mad will welcome a situation where they don't have to root only for their own side, when they can give a plus to someone they otherwise criticize, if only so that they don't have the feeling that they are orienting themselves only according to labels assigned in advance. One such situation is the list of heavily damaged monuments that President Zeman fiddles with during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what is going on. And anyone who occasionally travels through the Czech Republic sees a number of the devastated monuments - from the centres of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy may also come into play here. If we accuse the town hall of not caring about monuments or some horror in the land-use plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatised object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "Paragraph of the Heritage Act allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is not traceable, it must be admitted that the president calls for the enforcement of the law. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognise as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he is standing up for a good cause, just like the squatters, whom he himself does not recognise. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the abuse, the squatters are drawing attention to a problem that is not of current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's admit that the president is de facto doing the same thing.
If you come to the historical centre of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the minting of thalers (for Americans, dollars). Why? Apparently because of the quick sale of houses in the 1990s, say local officials. But why is it that seven kilometres away, Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks, who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has a nicely repaired historical core? It is good when the president draws attention to these things.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the time of departure will be adjusted, or their route will be slightly adjusted.
Dozens of new trains will also be on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets in the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections daily, of which an average of 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also include services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Along with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on routes from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
After its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will be replaced by Czech Railways.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářík, the carrier has also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible, despite the planned closure works.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Ceskolip region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single railway fare.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how hard they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and how they had to work and die.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
They don't even tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, killed them, while they were killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I won't deny that (in Japan, for example, the atrocities of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
By the way, when it comes to the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and they didn't like a lot of things either.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and what's more, our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT from a television where they cut off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalised and the schools often supported them in this.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it was supposed to and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalised.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
The police have charged the manager of CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, over advertising contracts
The police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, over advertising contracts. Pangrác confirmed to the SeznamZprávy server that he took over the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that the police were investigating contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money was returned to Pangrác, writes the server. In the case, the detectives were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), to whose department CzechTourism falls. The investigation into the case continues, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Centre Against Organised Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The office computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court order for a house search at Dostálová, which was previously quoted by ČT, stated that the minister decided in 2016, when she was deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism in favour of selected persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová then declared that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not make a mistake, she could document everything and was fully cooperating with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media had previously reported that it was the former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This showed that the CzechTourism agency had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me, but I don't want to comment further," Pangrác told Seznam Zprávy.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, prepares second generation of Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that, even though there was practically no infrastructure in the world for pumping hydrogen, it still put it on offer. Not quite standard, the customer had to really go after this car, but no one else was offering such an option at the time.
The head of Toyota, Takeshi Uchiyamada, confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be comparable in price to hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is connected with the development of fueling networks. However, the future is connected with hydrogen as well as with electricity.
At the conference, the word "hydrogen" was often used to refer to the needs of environmentally friendly operation, not of passenger cars, but of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to travel long distances on one refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen drive, which now also offers the hydrogen crossover Nexo.
There are up to sixty times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal group is more present in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic was published just this week, and the situation is even more serious than mankind has hitherto realized.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, there are "ten to sixty times fewer insects" in the forest today. This is a decline in the entire population, not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also shrinking.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the authors, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously assumed.
The report was the subject of a major article in the Washington Post on Monday, which described the new findings as hyper-alarming in its headline. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner from the University of Connecticut, whom the paper quotes as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also concerns Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of an order of magnitude," points out Lukas Cizek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it just takes a much longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Cizek to explain why scientists were able to measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
Nokia is suing a Brno company over the name Lokia. People will not mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia has objected to the application of the Lokia brand to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, product substitution is not likely.
The Brno-based company developing the CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the Brno-based company's warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, wrote the E15 daily. Nokia has therefore filed objections against the application for the Lokia trademark with the Industrial Property Office. CCV believes that confusion is not likely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that two dozen customers are already using the program, which has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand is recognized and trusted around the world, and when someone attempts to register a mark that we believe may cause confusion or dilute our brand, we take action to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
The Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand, famous in the past for mobile phones, when creating the warehouse program. The designation Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for a type of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be an analogy of the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading into the production of mobile phones. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be losing its way in its industry," said CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
CCV applied for trademark protection with the Industrial Property Office in August, before the programme was launched on the market. "It applied for protection for products and services belonging to classes 9, 35 and 42, since the software belongs to class 9, the related services of managing business activities in the warehouse belong to class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trademark is valid in all classes of goods and services, and thus applies to the widest possible range of goods and services, and therefore, of course, also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the claimant's assertion as far as it concerns the conformity of these classes of goods and services. However, in reality, they are completely different brands aimed at different target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to E15, the dispute over the brand may last for months and it may complicate the company's activities.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always comes out with some bullshit about the coronavirus that makes everyone feel ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without the Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to services with the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and even there, every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., they celebrate Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna to pick him up this time either. In the morning, they picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
It was also accepted at the border last year.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in with the troop every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouts travel to Vienna by train.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light on Saturday, 18 December, travelling on selected fast trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, so that they wear masks, try to keep their distance, there are as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, of light overcoming darkness.
In the Czech Republic, boy and girl scouts have been promoting it for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics, which confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education will make good use of the money, but I don't understand why the money is being spent on agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company."
I myself work in a factory where there are a million signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply kept alive artificially.
This is not supporting a company that employs x number of people, this is hindering development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Usti Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
The last time was at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to the gossip that swirled around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian, Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed exotic animals that he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros, Zamba, an elephant, Kalu, or an orangutan, Ňuňák.
The city council has therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns excluding VAT and for the city's Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns excluding VAT," said city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Doctor Poživil had to explain these unfounded suspicions. I consider this to be a blatant defamation of such a high-quality expert," she noted.
According to her, there are very few experts specialising in exotic animals. "It's definitely not pleasant. The zoo currently provides veterinary care by means of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same amount of money. "However, in terms of financing, the zoo must comply with the Public Procurement Act," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the cheetah Jane from Ústí was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on anonymous slander against his person. Yesterday, he did not accept phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As far as the contract for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians believe that the lack of interest in it is not necessarily due to fears of similar accusations, as in his case, but simply to a lack of information. For example, the Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of it yet. "This is the first time I've heard about it from you. No one has contacted us. I think this kind of thing will spread quickly," he added.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bíla!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová published her latest photos, in which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would judge me for taking nude photos at my age. I'm a rather shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, it's possible to have a solid figure even at the age of 46. Of course, there's hard work and self-denial behind it, but it can't be any other way."
"With Lukas Dvorak, we shot about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for its moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came to her baptism very exposed, confided to Blesk.
She wore an elongated jacket by Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten her bottoms. Daily running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening: her husband, her friends, even Slavica Lucie Bílou.
Totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes, even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm swayed by internet ads, but then I catch myself being influenced by them anyway - it's just so contrived that you can't always avoid it.
This is another reason why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all rubbish, in the words of a classic - I'd ban the internet.
There was a fire in the underground mine of ČSA in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a fault at a depth of about 1200 metres. "Nothing happened to any of the employees, no one was injured. Bán rescuers immediately intervened at the scene, who extinguished the fire by direct intervention and also carried out a site inspection. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," said the spokesman. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná mining district, coal is now mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-Jih. Mining in the Lazy mine is expected to end this year, with other mines also facing a gradual decline. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, with last year's production amounting to 4.62 million tonnes. 9,000 people work in the mines.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'll claim to be cryptic thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will premiere a record number of more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more festive films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales in particular are associated with this period, and the films Home Alone, Love Actually and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom in Christmas films did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning in its viewers for Christmas on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival network Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, what matters is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel, for two hours at least, a little bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and the craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which of course is resolved and they kiss.
It's like this all over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19, will not take part in final F1 race
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He had tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will therefore appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher starting from the last place and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively well and is not showing any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all concerned," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any replacement would have to qualify or drive in a different part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not encounter COVID-19.
At the start of the season just ending, Kimi Raikkonen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can get arrested for that, too.
And no one will care what the boss said.
From a legal point of view, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.
Section 152 Spreading of a contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the danger of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two years to eight years,
c) if by such act he violates an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious bodily harm.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three years to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious bodily injury to at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.
A pike in a pond, or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics for his optimistic view, such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment, low national debt, or the fact that, according to a recent study, our country is 24th in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development, however, also cited other, far less "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic is 154th in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may happen that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant building heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy, which is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. Although it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stands, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed railway or a metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd scramble for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bold change is for the worse."
And when it seems that something more daring might succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other rather stubborn associations, or by politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the "blob" designed by Jan Kaplický for the new building of the National Library, even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the excavators.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building high-speed train lines, so Germany finally decided to lead its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs to existing infrastructure are often drowned in the mud. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a real puzzle.
Babiš came into politics with the promise that he would "fix things." However, as far as meaningful investments and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are concerned, not much has happened so far. The amendment to the Act on the Acceleration of the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force since 2018, but we will have to wait for more extensive beneficial effects, such as easier expropriation of land. And the new Building Act, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of the construction procedure from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, begin to apply from 2021. However, many people would probably not bet on it.

Declaration of the End of the Right in the Chamber of Deputies, or What Kind of "Right-Wing" Coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN, and KDU?
The media and commentators have recently been reporting on the planned coalition of the parties mentioned. Many are applauding the fact that the "right" is finally getting its act together, but I'm more inclined to ask why these parties are still calling themselves right-wing.
If I ignore the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it makes no difference how the subjects label themselves or what label the mainstream media parrot. ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its left-wingness and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in its concept, ideology and voter targeting (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU has even been labeling itself as centrist for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you have the feeling that I have taken everyone out of the same water? No, I am basing myself on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wingness? How many laws cutting people's freedoms by the salami method, increasing taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing supervision, increasing ties to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all kinds of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And this has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be at all surprised by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and, with the exception of Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I basically do not see any obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. Nevertheless, ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing party" and, by linking with these three entities, it is already openly revealing its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the labels, have you noticed how often all these parties quite consistently and cheaply label the critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Are they unable or just unwilling to understand that there are many people for whom Eurosocialism and the growing lack of freedom do not smell as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not concealing their utter inability to argue and their groundless or blind adoration of the conditions in the European Union?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic only centrist politics has a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want this kind of combination. Maybe they want left-centrist politics under the guise of "right-wing," because they are ashamed of their political convictions (or they can't even identify them). I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championship
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships in Water Slalom in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualification, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be in Spain to strive for a semi-final start in the afternoon qualifying race.
Vavřinec Hradilek did not succeed from the strong representative group of kayakers, who received a fifty-second penalty for incorrectly passing the goal at the very beginning of the ride. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can now rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal of finishing in the top 30 in the first run, which I managed to do. Not that I didn't care how I did, because the start on Sunday is very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising his well-being in Seu. "Before the patrol race I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then during the race it was good and today it was better again. It's been beautiful here the whole time, nice races, spectators came, so it's fine," he smiled.
Prskavec was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I wasn't completely successful in the first goals. Then I drove the middle perfectly, without any problems, and I knew that I had enough mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the knob. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is there, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised themselves for not going to the start on Sunday until the end of the semi-final block. "I'm not a morning person, it's cold here in the morning, and when you're here at eight o'clock, you need a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Přindiš. "Overall, the semi-final takes an hour and a half, which is quite a good difference in terms of sleep," agreed Prskavec.
Fišerová was the only one of the three Czech canoeists to succeed, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the top twenty, while Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. "I skied the upper part as planned, in the middle section I felt like I wasn't keeping up and wasn't going as planned, but I managed to get into the comfortable lane I wanted to go. I made two nudges and I'm just behind the winner with a clear time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová praised herself.
Hunter injured in fall from perch, carried to ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past seven in the evening during the top matches at Čertův mlýn.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we requested the cooperation of the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The medics then sent an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
The rescuers found the hunter in the selected location with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian wheelchair across the impassable terrain.
"The transport along the route of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the chief of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service and the rescuer who intervened, the hunter's colleague was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured man was.
"That's why we found him relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka application on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have reached him sooner, and at the same time, the 155 dispatching centre would have immediately known about the accident and his situation," noted Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka application activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Czernin calls on Schiller to step down for saying the opposition is dirty
"I consider it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such a totalitarian expression anywhere, let alone in parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused an uproar during the discussion of the motion for a constitutional complaint against President Milos Zeman. The opposition did not obtain enough votes and the motion for a constitutional complaint, which was brought by the Senate, was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I'm getting dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages of support for the president and messages of how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straws are being batted around. And I'll even take the liberty, without using harsh terms, of quoting one of them: It's opposition and senatorial filth," said the Minister of Finance.
"This was the language used by the Nazis against citizens of Jewish origin, and by the Communists against their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without an ounce of respect for people and their opinions," wrote the deputy chairman of TOP 09, Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the current first deputy chairwoman, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, to the minister.
"I quoted one of the many messages that I received during the course of the House's proceedings. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal defamation that we witness in domestic politics on a daily basis and which was also the main motive of Thursday's proceedings in the House. The fact that someone applies the term to themselves surprises me," Schillerová told ČTK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is carrying out internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies, in response to a request from state-run Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which wants to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then have the bank pay the oil company's suppliers in cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign reserves, which are now near a 30-year low, Bloomberg reported, citing four sources.
Sanctions imposed by the United States on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolas Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system, further deepening the country's economic crisis - one of the most severe in the world - and forcing officials to use a patchwork of different ways to move money. While Maduro's attempt to launch the world's first state cryptocurrency has failed, the continued push to use digital currencies shows how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither the Central Bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value of these currencies it owns. The company has problems obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels, because large banks are not willing to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of 700 million dollars (16.6 billion CZK) in Chinese yuan, because the parties were unable to find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to be listed on the stock exchange and subject to due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank to pay the entities to which PDVSA owes. The oil company's representatives believe that the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that may arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions, in some cases allowing for relatively anonymous transfers without the need for a middleman. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of money laundering and client information issues that come with them and complicate compliance.
After the debacle in 2018, cryptocurrencies are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to expectations of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent over the past four days, but since the beginning of the year it has gained about 130 percent.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. This item is left to its bigger sibling, the Sportage, which is a direct response to cars such as the Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear part, can remotely remind the world of an SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market mainly among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be classed alongside the plasticised versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. In contrast, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so if you don't want to, you probably don't have to see the Ceed in new shapes.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed station wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect the basic atmospheric fourteen hundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged sixteen hundred with 150 kW, reserved for the GT version of the siblings. Do not expect a sports grade here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesels are only offered in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
The offer will soon be expanded to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that can travel about sixty kilometers on electricity alone. The battery can then also be charged from a normal outlet.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater astounds!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters were never worn a lot," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over the course of six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France, and the company Swarowski supplied 2,000 decorative crystals.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If MZ is detached from reality, it doesn't really matter - he'll have the faulty circuit blown up and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that FB's exit from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under the influence is out of luck).
I think it would clean up the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of "Soviet fraternal assistance" to some of our political parties and representatives could be better clarified.
Then the people who vote for them would also have a clearer idea of whose interests they are really interested in.
Too bad they don't own TikTok.
A lot of teenagers would be very surprised to find out that the sun is shining outside...
Sparta do not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. They have appealed against the two-match penalty
Sparta football club has appealed against the two-match suspension for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for being sent off in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
Letenský klub reported about this on its Twitter account and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeal committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now trying to get the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to play in Sunday's round of the 11th round of the first league in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could repeat itself. Back then, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary committee for being sent off against Liberec.
The appeal committee did not manage to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the punishment was postponed and Falta was able to play on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission eventually confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder the following week, and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian suspended Tetteh for a foul on David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of a Ghanaian player at the captain of the opponent, Tomáš Souček, has not been proven.

Spilková on par. In Indianapolis, she is on the verge of advancing after the first round
After the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis, golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys and finished the opening day in par at the LPGA series. With a score of 72, she is in 69th place, which is the expected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took some time off due to fatigue and exhaustion after a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she has not been very successful. Out of twelve tournaments, she made the cut three times, the best was 32nd in Hawaii. She is fighting to keep her card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and a lead of two shots over three rivals.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did the right thing! She looked younger with light hair
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even though she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped it. She changed her image so that her colleagues did not recognize her.
The actress Petra Černocká has never looked like a typical grandmother, with her hair streaked with grey, wearing staid clothes and going out sporadically. She has always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she is able to let go of her image.
Fortunately, she has not succumbed to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of good old indulona. And her anti-wrinkle formula is paying off. But now she has changed her hair color and she has completely seen through it.
When she arrived at the social event, where celebrities were bidding farewell to the summer, nobody could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow jacket, which made her even more radiant.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of their seventies they can take a risk with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks at most fifty.

On the situation in the USA with a leading African-American reporter.
In the United States, new cases of police violence are coming to light, this time during crackdowns on nationwide protests.
The demonstrations that erupted after an African-American man, George Floyd, was killed by a police officer during an arrest, have opened a debate about systematic racism, the work of the police and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to one of the leading African-American journalists, The Atlantic magazine reporter Adam Serwer.
But how would this funding be increased?
The Union pours money into us in subsidies.
If he stops doing that, we'll stop having the money.
I really don't see how the union ceasing to give us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be put to better use, but that's a whole other discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There is more than one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, then you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, put it on the distribution based on the undertone. Only in the next, consider the texture.
If you are a woman with a cold undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the warm skin tone category, choose such lipsticks. You can recognize them by the fact that they tend to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can focus only on your color preferences.

The end of political tobacconists? According to critics, the new law will not help anyway!
However, according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to help ministers to get rid of the responsibility for the election, while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 deputies voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who tried to make the recommendation for the minister binding. This was ultimately unsuccessful.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "The minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will not have clear and transparent responsibility," says SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS vice-chairman Martin Kupka is of a similar opinion.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions, which will include no criminal record, no debt, a minimum age of 25 years, and the main selection criterion should be expertise.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and then be signed by the president.
The government has approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO countries in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been going on for several months, inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Police union chairman Štěpánek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. This was announced on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. He will be the chairman of the union for another two months. He will remain in the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that I submitted my written resignation to the board this week, after which I will continue to perform my duties to the full for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free person who does not want to be tied to the trade union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said, explaining his reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic associates members and employees of security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for security forces. For example, in 2011 it got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior, Radek John, and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the government coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Sydney to London in four hours? A possible reality in 2030
Sabre combines a conventional aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concorde. "When the Sabre engine is put into operation, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And for example, the distance between London and New York could be covered by the aircraft in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed five times the speed of sound, are complicated by engine overheating, but Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should solve this problem thanks to the use of super-cold helium, which should prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about Sabre is that it's a hybrid of a rocket engine and an aircraft engine, which is powered by a stream of exhaust gases created from the air," says Shaun Driscoll from Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't evolved that much in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft engines have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and essentially create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year, followed by commercial flights around 2030.
My heart is like a bell and I have the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just take a few infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (CMH) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "diseases" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
During the check-up, the doctors detected mild signs of dehydration in the president. His problems with low blood pressure were caused by insufficient hydration. "In order to fix the dehydration of the body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the Central Election Commission stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president." In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral received several hate messages because of the health check.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So, a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if he were not a smoker, the liver functions as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are also in order, and I could go on and on," said Zeman.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic mainly at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president walks poorly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and his hearing is worse. Due to his health, he has cut down on smoking.
Going on holiday with just a payment card? The NEO account offers free withdrawals from ATMs all over the world!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who travel abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include convenience, security, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
Travellers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying by card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but nowadays payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to go repeatedly to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "holidaymakers" do not want to rely on the fact that cash is enough for them. In addition, Czech banks or exchange offices do not even have some foreign currencies. We have therefore solved the NEO account so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communication and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way of not losing your money than cash. If you lose a full wallet, its owner does not have to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. If you act quickly, he does not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages in addition to their reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and the account is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is planning to travel abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a payment card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are travelling. They often do not need any other arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities that travellers plan to undertake.
Women's basketball team falls short of medal at U-17 World Championship, finishes fourth
The third Women's World Cup of the Seventies was also won by the Americans, who defeated Spain in the final by just 77:75 despite 40 points from Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not to be beaten, but maybe we wanted it too much. We got the start, but we couldn't keep it up, because we were overrun under the basket," regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two three-pointers they took the lead 8:0 and dominated the entire first quarter. At that moment it seemed that they would repay their opponents for the defeat from the basic group 85:88 after extra time. However, the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary return to the game with a 12-2 streak.
"I'm convinced that all we had to do was score two or three more baskets, get to 20 points, and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but in what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch up," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything slip and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were kept in the game mainly by Petr Holešínská's accurate shooting from distance and the pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech shooter had a problem with fouls and was absent for a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they have already maintained, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five games were very demanding, we rotated the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of effort. Already against Spain, it was clear that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take them. Because of the physicality, we were not consistent in defense. We did not play a quick counterattack, we lacked a rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you do not put everything together, you will hardly win," added Fousek.
He believes that his charges have a promising future ahead of them. "In two years, the girls have managed to win the Youth Olympics, come second in the European 16-year-old championship and are now fourth in the world. By our standards, this is a quality team with a good character and we need to continue to work with them and develop their talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach they will assign to them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov Primary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms and four have no symptoms.
No one suspected of being Omikron has travelled abroad
None of them have travelled abroad, nor have any of their families, and there has been no contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of those mentioned, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienist, Pavla Svrčinová, said earlier that an international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales.
He wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after an embryo's heartbeat is detected.
People would then be entitled to recover damages from anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Texas' ban on abortion, even though it went against nearly 50 years of precedent that established a right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, enforcement of the ban was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law," said the California governor.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He said he had instructed his staff to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is the name given to home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority ruling.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials of the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, when the vaccination schedule is gradually worked out and the vaccines themselves are improved on the basis of the results.
Israel, for example, is already rolling out a large-scale study on the effects of the fourth dose.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will eventually have its own vaccination schedule, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market soon.
The amount of teaching material can be left as it is.
But rethink WHAT is being taught.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
These things could be really brutally reduced.
On the other hand, how many people leave primary school with some basic financial literacy?
And the other things he'll need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home we have Netbox and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland has threatened to stop paying into the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting illegally if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from an EU fund to rebuild economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And she is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified by the fact that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes made to the Polish judiciary during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is creating "impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "a political diktat carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
Someone killed a non-conflicted homeless woman under a bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder occurred sometime during the early evening to the night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who passed on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on the street Pod Krejcárkem could have filmed the murderer, for example, on a dashboard camera. A witness might have only seen him and could describe him. In short, we welcome any testimony to this case and will accept it on line 158," said the spokesman for the regional police directorate, Jan Daněk.
According to spokesman Daněk, the murdered homeless woman was non-confrontational, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene of the crime. "She most often moved around Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags with her," Daněk added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Mahulena Bočanová interrupted her one-year detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided in Blesk that she had given up alcohol. "During the holidays, I said to myself that I would give my old, exhausted fifty-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel very relaxed, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. Lately, I have not been well mentally. I wake up better, I do not have a headache, I have more energy and money."
A year of abstinence was enough and the actress found her way back to alcohol. "Sometimes I drink bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I have one glass and I have fun until the morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also liked the non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno entrepreneur Petr.
After the holidays, Bočanová also returned to the theatre season and will start in the series "The Rose Garden Surgery." "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was slurring my words. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
But to get to the bottom of it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I met one yoghurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I can avoid it, I won't go to any market, event or no event, the gold shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.

And I couldn't care less.
For two years I've been watching how data is treated like manure here, most anti-vaxxers are just a little more out of touch than most pro-vaxxers.
Although a rational discussion is taking place at the expert level, only extreme opinions are getting into the public space.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But no one is addressing the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states.
Phew, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
When I was a child, I was punished with boiling water.
It was never about grades, it was mostly about me repeatedly refusing to listen and misbehaving (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a punch (sometimes, even after another "catch," she just brought the spoon and put it where I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a couple of blows to my buttocks (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable manner and degree) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice whether to disobey and be punished, or to improve and not be punished.
In the end, I usually only needed a warning to start listening.
Former French President Chirac to be buried on Monday, public memorial service on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris, French media reported, citing Chirac's family.
The public will be able to bid farewell to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a memorial service at the Invalides in Paris, where the coffin containing Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysée Palace announced.
According to the AFP news agency, crowds of people have been flocking to the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign a book of condolences, which will be available until Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron has declared a national day of mourning for Monday.
Meanwhile, the world and France are reacting to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Edouard Philippe described today as "French in the true sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The Tribal Art Museum on Paris's Quai Branly, founded by Chirac, will not charge admission for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
Defending the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document, to which one swears an oath and which has been taught in school since time immemorial, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we have agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the constitution, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
At the time, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question in the same way that Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage.
Recently, however, lawyers are increasingly of the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, for example, the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, a constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we tie politicians down with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to wield their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate, they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby at the Brno University Hospital
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course tends to be much simpler, easier, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place in a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Only recently have very seriously ill children with coronavirus been admitted to the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-Covid syndromes have been in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects not only adults, but also adolescents and babies of a few months.
There are also children in hospitals in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
"We currently have a child several months old and an adolescent," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the children's hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part of the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination also alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-Covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the vaccination dose for children as well," the doctor added.
A new subway architect will oversee the D line, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Public Transit Company has chosen an architect to oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. Anna Švarc will take over in October. Her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, travelling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who was involved, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, has won a tender issued by the Prague Public Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other applicants took part in the tender. "The selection process included a letter of motivation and a CV. My previous experience from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people, was probably decisive," explains the new metro architect. According to her, her experience from the Institute of Planning and Development of the City of Prague could also be decisive.
He perceives the metro not only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have an aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved. However, I will only find out how it will actually work in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to their ideas," says Švarc.
"It is not a set of dogmas, but rather a set of recommendations, the main purpose of which is to maintain the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," explains the design manual.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve the public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal, or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really don't know yet," concludes Švarc.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest areas aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in the national parks outside the quiet zone (but do not climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You are not allowed to ski/cycle in the forest off the marked trails unless you have a special permit (but of course this is not so strictly enforced outside the national parks).

The Lessee undertakes to pay the Lessor advance payments for the services mentioned above, at monthly intervals, in the amount specified in Appendix 3 at the time of signing this contract by the Lessor.
The lessee agrees to this advance payment.
A deposit for services is payable together with the rent.
The lessor is entitled to unilaterally set a new amount of advance payments for services to the lessee, taking into account the services received by the lessee in the past period, so that the amount of advance payments corresponds to the approximate monthly services received by the lessee according to the past period; similarly, it may do so in the event of a change in price regulations or circumstances decisive for determining the amount of payments for the use of the apartment or the price of services received.
The change in the amount of the advance payment is effective from the 1st day of the month following the month in which the notice of the increase of the advance payment was delivered to the Lessee.
The lessee agrees with this method of determining the advance payments.
The Lessor undertakes, within 3 (three) months of receiving the final invoice from the suppliers of the individual services, to account for the advances paid by the Lessee for the services and for the services actually received.
Any overpayment or underpayment of payment for services is due on the 15th day after delivery of the bill to the Lessee, unless the Lessee objects to the bill.
The agreement of the parties to the bill is valid only if it is not regulated by a legal regulation.
Article VIII. Duration and termination of the contract
The contract is concluded for a definite period, until ...
The lease relationship established by this contract will end with the expiry of the period for which it is agreed.
The lease may be terminated at any time if the parties so agree.
Another way of terminating the contract is by notice.
Both the lessee and the lessor are entitled to terminate this contract in the situations, in the manner and for the reasons specified in the law.
Termination of the lease requires a written form and must reach the other party.
Both the lessor and the lessee shall state the reason for the notice and whether it is a notice without a notice period; in addition, the lessor shall inform the lessee of his right to object to the notice and propose a review of the legitimacy of the notice by the court.
The notice period begins on the first day of the month following the month in which the notice was delivered to the other party, unless it is a notice without notice period.
The lessee grossly violates his obligation arising from the lease, if
a. subleases the apartment or a part of it to a third party without the prior written consent of the Landlord,
b. carries out building modifications or other substantial changes without the consent of the Lessor,
c. fails to notify the Lessor of the need for repairs beyond normal maintenance and does not allow him to carry out these repairs, as a result of which damage to the property of the Lessor or third parties will amount to ten times the monthly rent,
d. if he takes in another member of his household, thereby exceeding the limit laid down in Article VI.
the last sentence,
e. animals or other organisms kept by the Tenant will repeatedly seriously disturb the other inhabitants of the house or the Tenant repeatedly fails to remove any contamination of the house caused by the animal kept by him and, despite warnings, fails to remedy the situation,
f. repeatedly violates the rules of behaviour in the house and the reasonable instructions of the Landlord to maintain proper order and, despite warnings, fails to remedy the situation.
The lessee breaches his obligation arising from the lease in a particularly serious manner, in particular, if the debt for unpaid rent or advance payments for services, the payment of which the lessee is in arrears with, exceeds the amount corresponding to three times the rent, or if the arrears for billing are not fully paid within three months of the due date.
Article IX. Return of the apartment
The lessee is obliged to vacate the apartment at his own expense no later than the day of termination of the lease, remove all equipment and accessories that he has installed in the leased premises, and hand over the apartment to the Lessor in the condition in which he took it over from him, taking into account normal wear and tear.
If there has been damage or excessive wear and tear to the apartment or its furnishings, the Tenant is liable for the damage caused by him or caused by persons to whom he has given access to the apartment through unconscious negligence.
In the event of the Tenant's delay in vacating or handing over the apartment, the Landlord has the right to vacate the apartment at any time at the expense of the Tenant, with which the Tenant expressly agrees.
The contracting parties have agreed that if the Lessee does not collect the items left in the apartment within 30 (thirty) days of the end of the lease, the Lessor is entitled to dispose of these items in an appropriate manner and to satisfy its claims against the Lessee from the proceeds.
The Lessor shall send any cash surplus to the Lessee to the account communicated by the Lessee.
Minor repairs and costs associated with routine maintenance of the apartment, the need for which arose until the end of the lease, will be provided by the Tenant no later than the date of handover of the apartment (end of the lease).
If the Lessee fails to do so, the Lessor will arrange the necessary repairs and routine maintenance at the expense of the Lessee.
The Tenant agrees to this.
Article X. Final Provisions

China creates the impression of a controlled contagion and that an authoritarian regime is better able to face the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the epidemic is under control and that the authoritarian regime is coping better with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was fending off criticism that it had failed to stop the disease from turning into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero new cases.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from Nigerian religious school
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were over three hundred children from the age of five upwards. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
The police chief in Kaduna, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of a complaint. He described the school as a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, it was a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakub Sabo, they were local teachers.
The children told the police that their parents or relatives had taken them to the school, saying that it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by their parents from the northern states of Nigeria," said the Sabo spokesman about the identity of the victims. The northern states of Nigeria are predominantly Muslim.
The Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal School purported to be a religious school focused on Koranic studies.
Those freed were taken to the stadium, where they are receiving help and food, and some have already been reunited with relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided by banks free of charge. However, it is necessary to consider the offer, because some other services for accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial institutions expect that the waived fees will be returned to them one day. Given the low migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably right," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that accounts for adults can do. The child gets their own payment card, can enter payments, track movements on the account, somewhere they have their own electronic banking. Banks will set up the account, but it is up to the parents to teach the children how to use it and also to check their payments.
"Parents can set fairly flexible weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Above all, however, they can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by browsing the internet or thanks to information SMS. Beware, these may no longer be free," adds Kuncová, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options."
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He mainly wishes him peace
The presenter and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any questions. In his show "Volej a pište šéfovi" (Call and write to the boss) he publicly comments on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he brilliantly and wittily comments on. Although this time he did not feel like laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news of Karel Gott's very serious illness. For his part, he promised the singer one very considerate thing.
"You know, Karel fell ill and said it fairly, without tabloid journalists having to poke around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all have enormous respect for Karel Gott. And I would like to wish him successful treatment and, above all, peace! Peace, which he needs right now," said the owner of Barrandov Television.
"I would like the media to leave him alone and wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't really like the various expressions of what his old friends and various celebrities think about his state of health. And for our media, I can say that we will deal with his illness and his person only if he shows interest in it. I think that other media should consider a similar approach."
The pair wrapped the bitch in tape and drowned her in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a one- to two-year-old dog that she wanted to take care of. However, her partner, who is ten years older, did not like the fact that it was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and significantly eliminated its vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied up. Then they drove the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank, and when they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside, so they called a woman who was passing by and fled. The woman reported the incident to the 158 police emergency line.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the inhabitants of the town, the police officers found out who was probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were not mistaken. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokeswoman added.
An expert opinion from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly agonizing way as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered for several minutes before dying.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly indicate a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police from Zlín accused the pair of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both of the still unpunished charges could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," noted Kozumplíková.
Plane crash near Žinkov in the Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were travelling in the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane requested permission to land at the Chaloupky airport near Klatovy at eight-thirty in the evening," said police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at that time, according to GPS coordinates, it should have been located near Vojovice, not far from Žinkov.
However, there was no flight to Klatovy airport. A search was immediately launched for the lost aircraft, which had sent a distress signal. "A police helicopter and a military helicopter were involved," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. However, the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometres from the place where the plane was last reported, the crew of the helicopter noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found the plane and two bodies without signs of life," Korandová confirmed.
The crashed aircraft remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, and pieces also fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for the Expert Investigation of the Causes of Aviation Accidents," added Korandová.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, I'm defending myself
The traditionally high-profile battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman at the world championships. The 23-year-old American is the world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has only lost once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was threatened due to a case of missed doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case at the beginning of September without bringing charges due to formal reasons. Although Coleman did not take three doping tests last year and this year, it was not within 12 months. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dated his first offense back to April 1, 2018, i.e. the beginning of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test itself until June 6. And since the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit the offense of three unperformed controls within 12 months.
"I don't take drugs, I don't take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's it," he said before the start of the World Championships.
He suffered his only defeat from six starts in the 100m this year right at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was beaten by just six thousandths of a second by compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but he will only run the 200m at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest competitor is 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru with a performance of 9.86, but he has only done well at American university competitions.
The title will be defended by the thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who shone with a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. However, he only ran the last hundred in Zagreb in 10.29 because he slightly injured his hamstring.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Rio Olympic medallist Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favourites. The fastest Jamaican is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men's hundred starts on Friday with the preliminary round and heats. The semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 CEST.
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
His wife is happy because he grazes the grass, washes the car with his trunk and the children play with him.
It's just great.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Friend: let's high-five, that'll be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for, an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car is falling apart, the children are fighting over it and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you're talking badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Ledjona Toni, an Albanian, studied medicine in the Czech Republic and today only a few people know that she is a foreigner.
There are hundreds of foreign medical students studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here, and the paediatric clinic in Prague's Motol has tried to recruit some of them.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to get up very early to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon. The Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleymaniyah, a city in the north-east of Iraq, where she works as a paediatrician in a hospital and still treats small patients in the afternoon as part of her private practice. In addition, she teaches at the university.
World events are dominated by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, it has been working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.

I thought of that, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces," i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and does not need to be further specified for American forces.
But then again, maybe I'm just playing with words:D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

She has now been banned from keeping animals for life at Gwent Magistrates' Court, The Sun reports.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who have been caring for Milly since her ordeal said they had never seen a marmoset so distressed.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily back playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year, at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay court costs of 12,000 crowns.
Small Monkeys rehoming team leader Steph Sawyer said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will go on."
It took time for Milly to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement caused her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she is settled and happy with a male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The mental scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent Police discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after raiding her flat on drugs charges.
Milly can be heard swearing profanely in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "You want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden in Kinder eggs at her home.
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row, if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you get the same things in first grade that you got in sixth grade?
And it's all killed by the idea of cramming, when nobody, with honourable exceptions, cares whether you can do it or understand it.
The main thing is to write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can identify the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the vast majority don't give a shit and will tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck are they studying for?
I'm a big fan of universal background checks, and the reality is that people don't want them and they don't need them.
And at that point, it's pointless and you're never going to get it in them anyway.
They learn it partly for the many people who will need this or that thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all that when you're standing at the machine, I meant that completely seriously... ...because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(In which our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elites probably play a part) However, the price of having barbarians standing at these machines is simply too high.
If journalists knew how to count, Covid would probably never have reached such proportions here.
Married at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the inquisitive questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Kadri and Andrea have been at loggerheads since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! was Kadri's angry response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Even his younger sister Linda did not like the alleged honesty of Kadri's now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in my family, we never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for putting on a brave face and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, reads the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole the equivalent of just under 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
He is then seen on one of the security cameras walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
It subsequently detained Cao.
The man admitted that he had drunk some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic emergency.

More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's council elections in four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new councils in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have been dissolved.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there, said the vice-chairwoman of the CSO, Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
In Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, gaining 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means a gain of two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Private Citizens, was again elected to the council on their behalf.
Komňany - independent candidates - won one seat in the municipal council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member assembly.
The second place went to the candidate Obec pro lidl, which received the votes of 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by the independent candidates Naděje pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and, in contrast to the regular elections in 2018, strengthened, gained one more mandate and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the State Electoral Commission will discuss the election results.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has new hope
Honzík's parents first noticed that something was wrong with him when he was a year and a half old. He always stared into space for several minutes, became motionless and did not respond to anyone. The paediatrician therefore sent him to a paediatric neurology clinic, where, after a series of examinations, the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, the doctors stopped the medication, and since the seizures did not return, the parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to encourage him to do more sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. However, at the age of eleven, he had another seizure and everything started all over again.
Doctors again tried various combinations of medications, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honza always lost consciousness during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and replaced his downhill skis with cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although the sport caused him to have a seizure from time to time, he never completely gave it up. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in case of emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try a different doctor and turned to specialists at the University Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, the doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for a surgical procedure to remove a lesion from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to undergo two operations in a row. First, the doctors inserted probes into my brain to measure its activity, and only then could they remove the lesion. It was hell for me for several weeks. I had to just lie there and barely move, with wires sticking out of my head that were connected to a computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the relatively large lesion. "The first days after the operation were very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. Compared to how he is normally lively and communicative, it was a frightening change, but fortunately everything returned to normal after a few days," says his mother and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had one seizure, but according to the doctors this happens. Since then he has been seizure-free for 3 months."
This school year, Honza will be graduating from high school. In addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has begun to work with Company E, with which he visits schools for discussions on epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is slowly returning to sports. "I am learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so that I do not expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not yet actively participate in the traditional EPPI canoe triathlon, which brings together epileptic patients and healthy athletes and which takes place this weekend on 28 September 2019 at the Veselská sand pit. But perhaps next year.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of ecclesiastical buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I am bothered by how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but state and church have nothing to do with each other

French chef sues Michelin for stripping him of star, says he suffers from depression
The famous French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after he received it. He intends to sue the publisher of the red guide to obtain the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also doubts the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, confused saffron with cheddar. The first court hearing is to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. He is going to sue the publisher of the prestigious guide, Le Guide Michelin, because, according to him, the conclusion of the commissioners was not well-founded. Moreover, according to him, the removal of the star occurred without any warning. "I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you play with the health of chefs?" Veyrat said to the commissioners.
Michelin only gave the chef vague reasons, such as the fact that the chef put cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspector did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have loved working with Savoyard ingredients," he objected to Veyrat's decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are impostors who only cause controversy for commercial reasons." The indignant Veyrat does not understand "how they could dare to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé." "They also insulted our region, my employees were mad about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he got angry.
The flamboyant chef, who always wears a black hat and dark glasses, is opposed to the new generation of Michelin inspectors and is therefore asking for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide, but the publisher refuses. "If the restaurant remains open and our inspectors choose it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Michelin.
According to Michelin, the chef's complaint indicates that he does not yet have any meaningful accusation and a lawyer will help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us in a rude manner, but we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
The man fell headfirst from a height of twelve metres.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, with rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Services intervening on his behalf.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - were immediately dispatched to the scene.
After arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal has caught on in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire brigade went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the emergency services, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The doctor who intervened intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care at the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman for the regional emergency medical services, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is primarily doctors and medical staff who are on the front line of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Germany reports its first case of mosquito-borne West Nile virus linked to climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito, the dpa news agency reported. Until now, all patients contracted the virus while traveling or through contact with sick animals. According to experts, the groundbreaking case of infection is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said that a 70-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. He had a severe course of the disease and was treated for brain inflammation in a hospital in Leipzig. He is now healthy.
The West Nile virus was first identified in Uganda in 1937 and has since spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s to the United States. It is carried mainly by birds, but also by mosquitoes that become infected through their infected blood.
The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
The outsider Julianna Pena managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, he showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Victory also went to Kai Kara-France, who quickly dispatched Cody Garbrandt with a first-round TKO.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf," Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even hit her opponent with a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a hand lever.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents played with a lot of excellent strokes and hard hooks.
Peňová also pushed Nunes to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up the effort and knock off the attack.
The American shocked everyone by becoming the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier did better, but the tables gradually turned.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to overpower his opponent with an armbar.
He didn't quite manage that, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and hit him with a number of punches.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira landed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a moment, but then had to tap out the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who had already deployed a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of well-aimed punches and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then handled Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter; now, after seven years, she lost.
This hip or that hip?
At first glance, there is nothing complicated about it.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and it is therefore not a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the gender is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When folded, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unbent form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "kyčel" are masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the pattern "machine," in the latter according to the pattern "song."
In the next group of nouns, there are different forms in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/row," "kedluben/kedlubna" or "brambor/brambora" (meaning food).
Both forms are grammatical, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly, there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "moat" and "moat," "doughnut" and "doughnut," etc.
Some words that entered the Czech language from other languages were originally oblique, but they are gradually adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image," which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet," which remains uninflected in the middle case, but in the masculine case has endings according to the pattern of "castle."
Civilization on borrowed time
Recently, I recalled a beautiful "order" from one of the great stories by Šimka and Grossmann, set partly in a cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she was crying all right, but at someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving in a very similar way.
They behave as if humans ruled the planet Earth. In reality, we are just a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its enormous forces like a strong gust of wind blows out the flame of a candle. Probably, few of them watch the famous British and American natural science documentaries dealing with the destructive capabilities of our blue marble. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to "blow up" and our advanced civilization would be ruined.
According to leading volcanologists, a number of large volcanoes are "locked and loaded" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it has to happen, happens as soon as possible, before wasting trillions of dollars on measures to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, because any really angry volcano can release it, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
Forcibly limiting the production of CO2 therefore makes no sense. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that with a significantly higher proportion of it in the air, plants produce more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For mankind, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
If we take into account the still insufficiently studied influence of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we can only come to one reasonable conclusion: Let's try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let's try to adapt to other changes with which we can't compete by force at the lowest possible cost!

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started heading to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take the precarious route?
And what is the situation on the ground?
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewables will not cover the increased demand, says the head of ExxonMobil in Europe
Renewable sources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unfavourable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, claims this. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, in which unused energy from the days when the sun and wind are enough can be stored for later, are still too expensive.
In Prague, Ducom visited the ExxonMobil centre, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services necessary for the company's operation.
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
Devastating fires, which Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and have ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to gloss over it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual assault, but by spreading the idea that "many of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping sexual abusers.
Troops rehearse, draw curtains as China prepares to celebrate at massacre site
The military rehearsed the parade over recent weekends, with shops in central Beijing ordered to close and residents near the square told to draw their curtains, military vehicles rolling down empty streets towards the square and fighter jets circling in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country would be displaying its military might, but one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would unsettle other countries.
She appeared to be referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are approaching, but there may also be concern in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against a Chinese-installed leader.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. On Thursday night, the southern Chinese port of Xiamen already presented a special light show. Xiamen lies opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Ahead of the anniversary, the list of banned items is growing and already includes drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, The Guardian reports, adding that China's popular social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information."
"It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) against all predictions," said China historian Maura Cunningham. "It's a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China came into being in 1949, when the Communists under Mao Zedong defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime's tanks massacred thousands of pro-democracy student and worker demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken on elements of a capitalist economy; critics say it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Houses under construction are flooding the Czech Republic, families do not have the money to complete them
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the resources to complete the family houses that are under construction and the banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete family houses that are already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best-case scenario, people are moving into unfinished and unregistered houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they can not afford to pay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and this has happened to us in fifty percent of cases.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are working without earnings," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they had calculated that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The most expensive materials were copper and iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
However, construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of graduates in construction in the Czech Republic and the influx of foreign workers is being held back by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable.
"In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček specified.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But a real vision is missing, says a commentator of the Czech Radio - mujRozhlas
In addition to traditional celebrations, the start of the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and chairman of ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
The Ministry is planning a meal voucher package from 2021. Nothing will change in terms of taxes
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which an employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers, will receive support for meals.
According to the chairman of the Association of Operators of Voucher Systems, David Rýc, even a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with catering, for example by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, health and social insurance will not be paid from it," said Schillerová on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax discount would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal ticket price. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases by the employer, but without a tax discount. The best value meal ticket for employees and employers this year is 123 CZK.
That's why I think the diploma is great, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely relaxed in our country, if you are not a complete idiot and have something left in your head, then the committee will not unnecessarily stifle you with theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got and I got it right.
As for the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it many times, it's really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there is an exam at the end of the course, which reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defence.
The car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, declares the headline of a lengthy piece written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative afterword, it says that the medical community has ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a relentless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people, which has not only affected public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now it's time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes mentions at the outset is the fact that from knowledge and knowledge of the facts to putting into practice is often a very long and tiring journey. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century handed out lemons, limes and oranges to their crew with the belief that they would prevent the disease. However, the British Navy abandoned this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take it into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but they became mandatory only in the sixties, as well as the first confirmed death in connection with asbestos dates back to 1906, although its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health breakthrough - no matter how significant - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society in which it was to be implemented," writes Hobbes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.
Obesity, on the other hand, is seen as a highly personal failure of the individual, which is said to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and films. But the truth is that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people, where the personal meets the systemic, where, for example, in medical schools, the training of future doctors devotes only 19 hours of the entire course to the issue of nutrition, at a time when 60% of the calories consumed by Americans come from ultra-processed food.
Just how stigmatized obesity is is illustrated by reports from doctor's offices, where overweight people typically experience shorter office visits, are treated with less empathy by doctors and are seen as more problematic patients.
But being overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113, and no country has managed to reduce or stop this increase.
Everything's fine, but don't inundate them with emails and phone calls, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be just as much a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it in a way that he's touching Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta puts obstacles in the way of artists.
If you don't post a story every day and a new picture at least every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, they keep changing what function is more important, whether it is a like, a comment or a save.
It's really pissing me off lately, so I might have to stoop to TikTok, where a lot of artists in my industry are having success and they don't give a shit.
In the end, I might even be glad if something more user-friendly comes along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Party of Workers of Donbass
Union - yes, break-up - no, this is how the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open connivance of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of a pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Russia's population has fallen by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Białowieża forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrialization, they put the brakes on agriculture, they tore away from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and abandoned in haste was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident on the D5: The motorway was closed by a truck collision
The incident was reported around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through the gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said in the morning. The operation was restored around 14:30. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.
A spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire brigade, Petr Svoboda, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles shifted, which the fire brigade had to secure first against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 liters. Due to the fuel leak, employees of the environmental department of the Beroun town hall were called to the accident. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the clearing of the highway was ensured by a private company, which also extracted the contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I buy it, put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I can wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth;-)
Germans elect Keller as head of football association
As expected, the current head of the Bundesliga club Freiburg, Fritz Keller, has become the new president of the German Football Association. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, restaurateur and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years and had no opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over an undeclared income affair, while his predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach are facing trial over possible bribery in the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said that one of the main objectives will be to restore confidence in the union and bring it out of the crisis. "It will not be a one-man show, many people will be responsible. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After being elected head of the union, Keller left his post in Freiburg.
Děčín Zoo is happy about a small macaque
"Our group currently has seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on 17 August, he was born to the female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. The first days after birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to her body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, she gradually began to put it aside for a short while and the zookeepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín zoo has already successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemic to the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live in the wild anywhere else in the world. Their typical features are black fur and a crest on the head, from which they get their name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, mainly at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which complement flowers and leaves. They meet their protein needs by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"If we leave aside the natural enemies, which are the pythons, everything else has been caused by humans. The locals hunt macaques as a favourite prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokeswoman added.

Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia lost control of the steering and drove off the road. The car flipped over onto its roof and he remained wedged under it. He did not survive his injuries.
"According to initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of Kokory drove off the road, where it overturned onto its roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
Just recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out a brochure, I always take things like that to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the workings of the world, but nowhere was there anything about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless instructions, like I should wash and not be a pussy.
What a waste of paper, the rainforests wouldn't have to be cut down for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
The psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with the person because you like him, without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she burst into tears and begged me on her knees not to go.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started being cheated on.
I then ended the relationship by telling her I was separating and lied to her but said we could talk about it next week to calm her down and stop her from running amok.
Such a person will drain you of your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing here by buying a cloud of tests and chasing the positive ones, who would not even know about this terrible disease without the test.
All we achieve is complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they have already stopped the charade, recognizing that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we're back to the same old shit.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it out (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of training in products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested in that, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, as I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk them down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realised that if you wanted to make money, you had to sell a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, it was a valuable experience, and I learned not to jump on every rumour and to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There are still uncertainties surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated this week that the army had planned a last farewell to the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence that was as bombastic as only soldiers can, despite the wishes of the family. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. The spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, Jan Pejšek, denied this.
"It's nonsense! We've been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday funeral date has been agreed from the beginning, no one has changed it. The same applies to military honours. We'll just have to deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejsek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and it will include all military honours, including a fly-over by fighter jets.
Even so, there is a tense atmosphere surrounding the last farewell to the popular general. The organizers have decided that people who worked with the general in the past will not attend the funeral ceremony!
One example is the former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as a hard-working, intelligent and "good guy."
In addition, in recent years he regularly met him at the celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "Personally, I would go to Milan Jakubů's funeral," Šándor told Blesk. But he can't.
"I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are out of luck, because the potentates will usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way," said the security expert. He is also not amused by the allegedly considered closing of the ceremony to the public for reasons of secrecy of the military top brass.
"The leadership of the army is not classified, and neither are the leaders of military intelligence, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family has actually allowed itself to be sidelined by the army, it is, of course, a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to override the family and its wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision between the Milan Rapid and a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).
An amateur racer in a curve was supposed to drive into oncoming traffic, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will bear the consequences for the rest of her life. The police questioned the person responsible for the accident on Thursday.
Czechs and children denied entry. CTIA uncovers discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, incorrect information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to allow smaller children to enter the establishment. According to the CTIA, it writes on its website that the establishment is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "In response to an electronic inquiry from a consumer as to whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child under the age of four in the said restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague business did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to sit at the table, while English-speaking people were allowed to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a spokesperson for the CTIA described the situation.
Both cases are currently being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been finalised, the spokesperson for the inspectorate was unable to provide more detailed information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination mentioned, in 64 cases other errors were detected. Most of them were deficiencies in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
On Wednesday, the inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many such things.
HR is calm, the managers mind their own business and don't poke their noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation does take place, in the form that it does in our country (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, and the like.
Company events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are a kind of quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But that's how it works, they don't bother us too much as long as the results are there.

A Czech woman who went missing in the UK has died.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, no further information will be released at this time.
My sincere condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on the bus on her way home from work, where she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began to search for her, Interpol included her among the missing around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of.

At the end of the year, four municipalities gained new councils
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have been dissolved.
There were 99 valid candidates running for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won mandates.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new council elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place there.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday, 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
Let the fans be positive, wishes Hašek. A hit awaits Sparta in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed, to manage the game and the result," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for club television.
In the week, a goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was an obligation for it. It was relieved, but it continues to struggle.
Even though the season is slowly moving into the second third, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, who have very good players. We're in for a difficult game," warned Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady for the last time, in mid-May, it was an unambiguous affair in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a 0-4 thrashing, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While at that time the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, now Sparta is losing nine points after ten matches of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst entries into the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for us, nor for the fans, who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," says Hašek. "But we would be happy if they continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if it will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match suspension for expulsion in Pilsen, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only member of the squad to remember Sparta's last victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain on the sick list.
The home team, which has won the last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the game by defender Jakub Brabec, a native of Sparta.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Václav IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed by people in Prague's Klementinum today and on Saturday. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Václav IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archive. The National Archive looks at the written heritage from the reign of Václav IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on agriculture by Petr de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or to a breviary, i.e. a prayer book by one of the Benedictine nuns of the Monastery of St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he listed the reasons why people should, in his opinion, visit the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be on display, where the introductory miniature H (enrico) depicts the half-length figure of the English king Henry II. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin anthology of John Wycliffe's tracts from the period around 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the library of Wenceslas IV has been preserved on Czech territory. According to experts, this library belonged to the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king longed to build a representative library that would match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library ceased to exist soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. However, several codices were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a whole range of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the digital library Manuscriptorium," said the Director of the National Library, Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition entitled What's Hiding Under the Floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be open free of charge in Klementinum.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
At the very beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease, but it went without any major hiccups.
I'm still struggling to come to terms with how idiotic a large part of the population, at all levels, is about this.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not animals.
He would be deprived of the post of president and of the ability to regain it.
However, the chances of this actually happening are, as others have mentioned here, very small.
Moreover, I am not sure if shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: Growing number of under-35s have gone a whole year without sex
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight per cent to 21 per cent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to be sexually active, with only 5% saying in 2021 that they had not had sex in the previous year.
For single people it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital sex and religious belief also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex is divided, about 30% consider it to be a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people who are unemployed or on a low income are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they are good with money, but the survey does not confirm this
"It turns out that young Czechs are somewhat more confident in their knowledge of finance than is the reality. In this case, a significantly higher proportion of wrong answers were given by women and respondents without a high school diploma," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university students are more likely to trust their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn most about the workings of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), via self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in the third place from lessons at school (21 percent).
It is mainly women who consult their parents on financial issues, while men are more likely to seek information on the Internet. Obtaining financial information from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their level of education or personal income. Brochures of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have practically minimal influence.
"The importance of the upbringing of children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is once again evident. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring is crucial," said Palendalová.
Ninety-four percent of young people prefer to save and invest.
Young people have a clear position on the question of whether it is better to save and, for example, buy their own house or apartment, or to enjoy themselves and rather spend money, without saving and owning their own home.
The strategy of saving and investing in long-term tangible assets is professed by 94 percent of respondents. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of education, social status or current level of personal income.
The saving strategy is then fully supported by people in a marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the other hand, people living alone and with an income of more than 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
The whole Covid vaccination mandate is about whether society should force a segment of the population into behavior they don't want, but which may save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, in which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if we do not order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old person who did not really know much, we did not explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he did not get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be held responsible for the death of a hardened anti-vaccinationist who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, is shouting about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have only themselves to blame.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of higher ticket prices
The most expensive item every year before the Grand Prix is the registration fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno for the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," added the economist.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns
- Profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for the event, increasing registration fee for the promoter Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, the use of advertising space, an increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organisation of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money out of public budgets for other matters. To a certain extent, however, it is a political and not an economic question," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher, as the option of increasing the registration fee to almost double is in play.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that the advertising must be placed in places that are not covered by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," explained Vaňková.
The organisers can also earn more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets accordingly," said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
I still see myself as a boy who is just getting to know himself, says Jan Cina
"It was a great school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dance there. Since I have something of the Roma in me from my father, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself primarily a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories of the role of a cameraman in the new film Národní třída than of the series První krok. Cina revealed that the director Štěpán Altrichter had to entice him a lot. "The work was demanding, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was shot on Národní třída, where I drove as a non-driver. A lot was also shot in Prague's South Town," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.
Even though he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it to be the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just getting started. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, saying that he had not even thought about an acceptance speech in the event of victory. "Not at all, but as a child, when I listened to discussion programmes on the radio, I always imagined myself speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was also slippery. So it didn't take long before he was lying on the ground. He was able to turn it into an advantage. He had a Vančura's Stairs workshop, where he taught how to fall down the stairs safely at VIP events."
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, for the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but many countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state with a population of around five million produces only 0.4 percent of global emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis being electric.
The official tourism organization states that about 95 percent of energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica ran on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region and around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast of almost thirty national parks, which is a lot considering the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or cloud forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you will also find several rescue stations for sloths.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizerská 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I do have a story, but it's not about a churchgoer.
One day in high school, our teacher took us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and what do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they descended on us.
Fortunately, I escaped, but they started talking to one of my friends.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly make it clear that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group," which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially provoked a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and a weapon, as night after night we register hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
A vandal damaged a cemetery in Dobruška
According to the notification received by the police, the vandalism on the scattering meadow inside the Dobruška cemetery was to take place on Wednesday between 1 and 5 p.m.
"The material damage was estimated at 60 thousand crowns. Police officers are asking any witnesses to the event to report their findings in person at the office or by phone on free line 158," said police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná.
Detectives are investigating the case as damage to property and disorderly conduct, which carries a prison sentence of up to three years.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun was already driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving licence for failing to give way and leaving the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, reported TVN24.
She admitted that another nun had bumped into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
She was breathalysed and had her licence immediately suspended after her blood alcohol level was found to be over two per mille.
At the same time, they informed her that she would have to answer for her actions in court.
The Slovaks have succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded with an appeal against the closure of the stadium for the racism of fans. The team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualifying match against Wales without spectators, but instead the association will only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of their fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting players of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. It closed the stadium for both associations for one match and fined Slovakia 20 thousand euros and Hungary 67 thousand euros.
After an appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15 thousand euros for offensive political chants. The next match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship with Wales on October 10 in Trnava will thus be made available to fans.
Shops destroyed, fires in the streets, riots during the memorial procession
Five years ago, 43 students of the Ayotzinapa College disappeared, and despite an extensive investigation, it has not yet been possible to clarify the case. The students were allegedly detained by the police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports APTN.
On Thursday, a memorial procession was held in the capital of Mexico, the families wanted to express their frustration over the fact that they are still unable to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
The mostly peaceful march, however, was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. The vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not hesitate to destroy monuments, set fires around the city and blew out windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would do everything possible to catch him and asked the public for any information that could shed light on the case.
More than 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but not a single one of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, the investigators allegedly tortured the suspects, adds APTN.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Sajmovic, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the dog who taught people how to live, another film, Here We Are, is now competing for viewers' emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film, I'm Watching Over Here from 2012.
Hugo, the talking dachshund, and some of the familiar characters around him return.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, and so they begin to invite dog walkers, Julia's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenager experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog film, but there they were at least entertained by children and a dog.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's recap.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that the miraculous process of the dog's recovery can take place in the heart of the Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer, however, is astonished at how much content, full of implausible situations and figures, was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog-walking competition, a Šumava charlatan, police officers arriving to search for "drugs" and discussing the fertilising power of bone meal over herbs - and who, of course, get drunk in the guesthouse.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits at the family table, dolled up and made-up, with a cigarette, demanding her father's whisky and meatloaf as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "sometimes this happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build situations, a feel for the characters and the point, and direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is muddled.
No matter how much Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their own, they don't have much to play for.
The only merit of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch in a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-whistles, let alone the more vernacular profanities the characters indulge in.
The argument is not even the long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog must be accompanied by knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This did not succeed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to incessant abuse exactly from morons like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how little you understand, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job to earn extra money.
Thomas Cook: Czechs thrown out of hotel in Majorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency this week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion, and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papeže, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, however, cannot be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told ČTK today.
In addition to the two prematurely ended trips, the travel agency is also dealing with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own pockets, although the company is trying to provide guarantees to hoteliers. The travel agency has promised to reimburse its clients, and according to Papeže, the company has sufficient collateral for this.
The problems in the hotels arose primarily in Mallorca, where the company asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases in which the local hotel threw out all the tourists from the office. "The hotelier could not determine who belonged to the German and who to the Czech company. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel, even though the local Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook last year increased its sales to 995 million crowns, up by almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, decreased by about seven million to 15.3 million crowns. However, the company had an unpaid loss of almost 103 million crowns from previous years. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen in some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced a resident of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, and is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are susceptible to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about the drought for a long time.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a decrease in rainfall," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or the recycling of waste water.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
The number of tanker trucks on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, is increasing.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years," said Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, in September.
Clashes erupt between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said the talks in Vienna had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna have made "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."

This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I teased her a bit and grilled her in conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me a thug, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalization room with a television showing footage of the brutal police intervention against students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. This is also in the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the curator of the exhibition, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration taking place in Semily on 22 November, and then more people gradually arriving every day," he said. Among the most active at the beginning was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate surroundings to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečková couple, who were circulating the petition "Several Sentences." According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also formed relatively quickly at that time. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.
Visitors should be drawn into the events in the city at that time by around 50 photographs, the pictures were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on 27 November 1989, shot by František Tomíček, has also been preserved and will be played on a loop for the entire duration of the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily archive has also lent a number of preserved banners from that time for the exhibition. "They said: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some changes in the city were very rapid at the time, for example, in December, people decided in a city-wide vote that the square would be Riegrovo and cancelled the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then museum of the workers' movement," said Chvátal. One room is supposed to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is dedicated to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Anyone who experienced it will recall the posters "With us to Europe" or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading of the OF with the beautiful motto "Every man for his community," added the curator.

The request for consent must also be in writing.
If the lessor does not respond to this request within one month, the consent is deemed to have been given.
If the lessee violates the above-agreed obligations, it is considered that he has grossly violated his obligation.
The sublease ends together with the lease.
If the lease ends, the lessee is obliged to inform the sub-lessee in good time, stating the decisive facts, which are in particular the day of termination of the lease, the length of the notice period and the beginning of its run.
If the lessee allows a third party to use the thing in accordance with the law and this contract, he is responsible to the lessor for the actions of this person as if he used the thing himself.
VII. Termination of the lease
When handing over the item, the lessee is entitled to separate and take back everything that he has put into the item or brought to it at his own expense, if this is possible and if this does not worsen the nature of the item or if it does not make its use unreasonably difficult.
If the apartment is vacated during the lease period, the lease ends.
If part of the apartment is lost during the lease period, the lessee is entitled to either a reasonable discount on the rent or to terminate the lease without notice.
Termination of the lease requires a written form and must reach the other party.
The notice period runs from the first day of the calendar month following the receipt of the notice by the other party.
In the event of termination by the lessor, the lessor is obliged to inform the lessee of his right to object to the termination and to propose a review of the legitimacy of the termination by the court.
The landlord may terminate the lease within the three-month notice period only for the reasons specified in the provisions of Section 2288 of the Civil Code, and is obliged to state the reason for termination in the notice.
The tenant has the right to apply to the court to examine whether the notice is justified, within two months of the date on which the notice was received.
The landlord has the right to terminate the lease without notice in accordance with Section 2291 of the Civil Code.
and to require the lessee to hand over the apartment without undue delay, but no later than one month after the end of the lease, if the lessee breaches his obligation in a particularly serious manner, in particular:
a. if he has not paid the rent and service costs for a period of at least three months,
b. if it damages the apartment or house in a serious or irreparable way,
c. if it causes otherwise serious damage or inconvenience to the landlord or persons living in the house, or
d. if he uses the apartment in a manner or for a purpose other than that agreed upon without authorization.
If the lessor does not state in the notice what he considers to be a particularly serious breach of the lessee's obligation, or if he does not, before serving the notice, invite the lessee to eliminate his improper conduct within a reasonable time, or to eliminate the illegal situation, the notice is disregarded.
The tenant is obliged to hand over the apartment to the landlord on the day the lease ends.
The apartment is handed over when the landlord receives the keys and otherwise nothing prevents him from accessing the apartment and using it.
If the tenant leaves the apartment in such a way that the lease can be considered terminated without any doubt, the apartment is deemed to have been handed over immediately.
The lessee is obliged to hand over the apartment in the condition in which it was taken over, regardless of normal wear and tear during normal use and defects that the lessor is obliged to remove.
The lessee is obliged to remove the changes made to the apartment with the consent of the lessor, if the parties have agreed that at the end of the lease the lessee will return the apartment to its original condition.
The lessee is obliged to remove the changes made to the apartment without the consent of the lessor, unless the lessor informs the lessee that he does not require the removal of the changes; nevertheless, the lessee cannot claim compensation, even if the value of the apartment increases with the changes.
The landlord may claim compensation in the amount of the reduction in the value of the apartment, which was caused by changes made by the tenant without the landlord's consent.
Equipment and objects fixed in the walls, floor and ceiling of the apartment, which cannot be removed without a disproportionate reduction in value or without damaging the apartment or house, pass by fixing or inserting into the ownership of the owner of the apartment.
The lessee has the right to demand that the lessor settle with him without undue delay; this does not apply to what the lessee has done without the consent of the lessor.
The compensation is due at the latest on the day of termination of the lease.
The landlord has the right to compensation in the amount of the agreed rent, if the tenant does not hand over the apartment to the landlord on the day of the end of the lease, until the day when the tenant actually hands over the apartment to the landlord.
If a thing remains in the apartment that can be considered to belong to the tenant or a member of his household, the landlord will take care of the thing for the benefit of the tenant and at his expense.
If the lessee does not take over the item without undue delay, the lessor has the right to sell the item in an appropriate manner at the lessee's expense after giving the lessee a reasonable additional period of time to take over the item.
This does not apply if it is a thing that the tenant or a member of his household has obviously left.
The lessee may terminate the lease if the circumstances on which the parties appear to have relied in entering into the lease contract change to such an extent that the lessee cannot reasonably be required to continue the lease.
In the event of the death of the lessee, the contract is governed by the provisions of Section 2279 et seq. of the Civil Code.

Skiers headed for the mountains at the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
The downhillers were not deterred by the obligation to show a COVID-19 certificate at the lifts.
While ski lift operators are not complaining about a lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the trails and the slopes over the weekend.
The skiers were lucky with the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend has really worked since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, Jakub Hanuš, praising the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena in Karlov and the resort in Branná in Šumperk were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, praised the representative of the ski resort in Branná, Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn sketch centre told ČTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales outlets are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects more pressure during the ski courses.
The managing director of the Hradec Králové-based company Snowbear, David Šinták, also feels that, due to Covid-19, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be.
At this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, the pandemic has made people lazy and they have learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, the rental company in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent the runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the area, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and wealthy not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include the socialist health care system, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Clever and resourceful people who have no assets here are leaving for other countries.
The owner of a company doesn't just go abroad.
But I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began when, one fine day, Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position any day now.
Another question is the elections.
If life is bad here, then some traditional V4 lunatic could win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming very concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing by a co-worker on December 3.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman MP, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel we all have a particular responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working for our health service here," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine like that.
These are not "huge numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our involvement.
I quoted above.
I don't know how he came to the conclusion that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of an expensive joke, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is wrong on so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Well, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague on Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will see several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
New lines have been created, some have changed routes, and others have disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav is newly joining the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice have been stopping at Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will run, which pass through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will now be extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will travel to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavů and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including routes that cross over into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be closed, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation of 12 existing lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go all the way to Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
The connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the express line number 404 will be newly launched.
Lines 400 and 410, which run to the Liberec region, are newly included in the PID system.
They leave from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, operations on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines, including those to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, have been cancelled or limited.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to railway modernisation, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines, and a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being expanded with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets all the way to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.

Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a standard 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy next door or Lidl a little further away.
Since I don't do any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthily and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and the most I can buy in a hurry is a pizza bun and a yoghurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what would you recommend me to buy at the supermarket that is healthy and does not require cooking?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, that's just the way it is.
And it's not the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're banned from going off-piste, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even divorced the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But she says he picked her up, not the other way around.
They are the centre of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
The singer continues what neither of us were looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Either those who are not interested at all and it jumps out at them even from the can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were a good match, or you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's great, that's what you want, Dara complains.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be finalised.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but have only been legally married for three weeks.
In any case, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are only human, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leština (Havlíčkobrodsko) - A farm in Nová Ves u Leština in Havlíčkobrodsko has opened Pumpkin World today for more than a month. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipkova family's fields have matured longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has not been kind to them in the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some types did not work out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some types for connoisseurs did not work out," said Pipková. Nevertheless, there are more types to choose from on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and chiseling decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental gourds of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually hoe the plants and harvest their fruits, and cut pumpkins from the stem with scissors. Pipka's Pumpkin World has been open regularly since 2010, and previous years have attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other ways to prepare pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, and we let ourselves be inspired," said Pipková. She noted that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like cucumbers.

Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually got to know each other and became friends during the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to take a look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole and in that direction is fine, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you are going).
I've never been looking for rent, but I'm a native of Brno, so I can help with Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
To me, this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite all right that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it themselves or let them follow the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot allow a private actor to dominate a part of education just because they can add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, they will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such an assertion loses some of its weight when it is made by a man who, two days earlier, said this about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against abortion is the same as a vote against a statue in the town square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, affecting five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann is cancelling the flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and its German subsidiary.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., operating under the trade name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, has not filed for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, approximately 500 clients will be affected by the cancellation of flights. According to him, Neckermann's 800 clients who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flight will be ensured."
The travel agency admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to contact the Neckermann travel agency's SOS line immediately," added Šrámek.
The collapse of Thomas Cook occurred on Monday. In August of this year, the travel agency entered into an agreement under which creditors were to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism, which was to become the majority owner, and the other half was to be provided by the bondholders and creditor banks. However, on 20 September, information appeared that the creditors demanded that the travel agency obtain a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the agreement would fall through. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either throw it away or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than Odrysian?
Oops: someone has already figured it out for you.
Check out the comment with Φ<unk>ΛH
Politicians do not even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is a much worse problem than the fact that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important documents to be approved are examined word for word, for which a basic knowledge of English is not enough anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with the English language, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
Trump is considering deregistering Chinese stocks in the US
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering revoking the authorization of Chinese companies to trade on stock markets in the United States, an informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The shares of the affected companies on the New York Stock Exchange immediately went down after the report, dragging the entire market down with them.
The pullback would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in China, the source added, confirming a Bloomberg report that sent shockwaves through financial markets earlier in the day. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI were down between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the American stock exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE, including at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
The Bloomberg agency pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been developed that would ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from American stock exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who, however, gave the green light to negotiations on this matter.
China and the United States have been waging a trade war for more than a year, in which they impose tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has a negative impact on the world economy and raises fears of a global recession. Washington is using tariffs to force Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's surplus in trade with the United States.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China are set to resume on October 10, with the aim of ending the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not in danger, reports Kremlík. However, a change of operator is in the offing
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport launched preparations for a new tender for the operation of a new toll system. This is a backup plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract is cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another provisional solution if the tender is not completed on time. Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) said this on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) prohibited the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not in jeopardy. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services of operating the new toll system, which is currently being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the minister.
In the tender, the state would be looking for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor for the use of the old system, which is currently operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience with the toll tender so far, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is mistaken and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period set by the ÚOHS," he said.
In addition to the new tendering procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged solution.
The state is therefore unlikely to make use of the offer made to it in recent days by the current toll administrator, Kapsch. The Austrian company has offered the state the operation of the current system in the event that the toll contract is cancelled.
Kremlík also reiterated that he believes that the backup plan will not be needed. The ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
On Thursday, the ÚOHS issued a decision prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not come into effect until one year after the authority's decision comes into force. This is not final and can be appealed to the chairman of the authority. The ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
In last year's tender for a new toll system and its operator, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which was unsuccessful in the tender with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
"Terrifying study result." Islam does not belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians believe
1,200 respondents were questioned, the survey shows a considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, 48 percent would like to see a ban on the construction of mosques, and 80 percent would like to see more monitoring of Islamic centers.
The majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices and say that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says the author of the study, Wolfgang Aschauer, and adds: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will narrow."
Among believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer claims that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help to blunt polarization.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by extreme right-wing voters, people without a university degree and senior citizens over the age of 75, while the most welcoming are Green voters, people under the age of 30 and university students.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of approximately 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim places of worship and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
I don't understand the hatred for Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and I'm completely fine.
I often leave work at 10pm and it's never a problem.
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of Brno's Romani population lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't:D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the centre, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on their Advent wreaths, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath a long time ago and I'm sure Lucie has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucía, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to talk to, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana and singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that very clear.
'A travesty of justice': Scientist who warned of pollution cancer jailed in Turkey
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik and other scientists participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health, which concluded that the pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country was associated with an increased incidence of cancer in the local population.
In particular, the researchers mentioned the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul and is home to a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. According to them, people living in the area suffer from cancer much more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, defies international criticism
It seemed to Sika that the government was not taking any action on the matter, despite the clear conclusions of the study. He therefore wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities then began to prosecute him for disclosing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that directly affect public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing whistleblowers through the courts, the Turkish authorities should be investigating this major public health problem," said Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International Turkey.
Environmental and human rights groups have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
After the failed 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a massive wave of arrests, with nearly 80,000 people now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities have also suspended or dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights groups accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents, but the authorities say the measures are necessary to ensure national security.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know of any other agency that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so the fire brigade alone and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is down to previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite some time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not just be a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and smaller amounts of precipitation are also recorded in places where there has not been a shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought, which prevails in a large part of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the way we manage the land also amplifies the impacts.
What should we prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveller Zikmund or General Boček. The Senate handed out commemorative medals
The ninety-six-year-old Boček, who was a fighter pilot in the British Air Force during the Second World War, thanked for the awarded medals on behalf of all those awarded. "The Senate was one of the first to not forget and does not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award that I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let's not forget our roots, which, whether we like it or not, connect and shape all of us. After all, our successful present is based on these values," said Kubera.
The awards were given to Renata Cífková, cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist, Petr Sáha, long-time rector of the Tomas Bata University in Zlín, Václav Cílek, geologist, writer, traveller and populariser of science, Jiří Hamza, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union, and František Paštěka. The upper chamber praised his heroism - this January he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. Former chairmen of the upper chamber Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Together with Jiří Hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a series of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a range of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of broadcasting for Radio Free Europe, and now works with public service media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and scriptwriter, and the musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The astronomer and emeritus head of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, received the medal in advance, in July, on the occasion of his hundredth birthday. By the end of the year, the Czech-born and first US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and the British philosopher and political scientist, Roger Scruton, who, among other things, was involved in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia, are to receive the same award.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in her ability to capture people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, a minefield. The pictures of her wearing a protective suit and a face shield became iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of people's hearts would breathe her last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son, Harry, has also scored a point when, after 22 years, he went to the same place as her. He went to the mine clearance site in Dirico, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very pensive. He certainly could not help but remember his beloved mother, whom he lost when he was only 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community to find peace, which also brings opportunities," he said, and also appealed to save and maintain wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
"The Duke is honoured to be able to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to learn about their tireless mission and to speak up for those who he (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even if the issue was not universally popular," the Sussex Royal Instagram post said.
However, royal fans may be annoyed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip to remember Diana. Both of them have had a separate agenda from Harry since Wednesday, probably for their protection. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield does not sound very safe, and Harry does not want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.

It's true, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey, and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also total nonsense.
And whether you're a hockey team called "Russia the Bear" or "China the Llama," losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different from when it's tied.
But anyway, what I hear from Czech commentators, what they pick out, what the referees notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it would be business as usual, and since the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost last year" vs "we won."
Unsuccessful qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková was eliminated in the heats of the 800 metres and neither pole vaulter Romana Maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place with which she surprised in London two years ago, qualified.
The start on Friday will be completed by the hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
With her third attempt, Šafránková threw 65.46 metres and fell almost six metres short of her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth heat in the penultimate sixth place and even the time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semifinals. She was one and a half seconds behind her maximum this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately, I fought with my opponent in the corner, which took quite a lot of strength. I felt that I still had strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start running again, so it was a bit uncomfortable in this one. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was glad that she overtook at least one of her rivals in the finishing straight. "She really wasn't well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half marathon runner in the heats was Winnie Nanyondo from Uganda in 2:00.36.
The best 800m runner of recent years, Caster Semenya from South Africa, is missing in Doha. She has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but like some other runners, she refuses treatment, which has been mandated by IAAF rules since this year.
In the 100m heats, the role of the number one favourite was confirmed by the American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one to get under ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at the age of 37 is seeking to defend his title, also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who with a performance of 9.86 is second in this year's tables, did not start and his duel with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season, was expected.
The Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría already showed great form in the long jump qualification, reaching a distance of 840 cm with his very first jump. No athlete has jumped so far in the World Championship qualification in the last 20 years. The twenty-one-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with a performance of 865 cm.
The Slovenians beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the first title of European champions. With the support of almost 12 thousand rioting fans in Ljubljana, they defeated the reigning two-time world champions from Poland 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will face in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
In the semifinals, the Slovenian team was much more compact than the Polish world champions. They only owned the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players outdid themselves in defense, and of the players in the red-and-white jersey, basically only the Cuban-born Leon scored points.
On the other hand, in the home line-up, both dunkers, Čebulj and Urnaut, and also the second all-rounder, Štern, who soon replaced the unimpressive Gasparini, presented themselves in top form. The Poles paid the price for having won all the previous matches at this Euro with aplomb, while the Slovenians gained self-confidence after tough battles in the play-off with the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenians lost 1:3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifier in Gdansk this August, but they avenged the defeat at home. Now, however, they will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena Stožica. Nevertheless, after today they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championship four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, just behind the Czech national team.
Be kind to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and look at a model of how smart cities will look. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not open to the public at other times," advises the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists, Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to CULS and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "friendly to the planet."
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
The number of confirmed cases over the past 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1,967 per 100,000, and 871 per 100,000 over the past week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections were registered.
It's the lowest daily total since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Britain's Health Protection Agency, said on television Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already being hospitalised in the UK, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
UK Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended the fact that the quiz took place "virtually," on a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of staff, gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's UK editor: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can they be expected to be?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit itself, and does other tricks, big and small.
The latest one is that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to funnel voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
It all starts with the tongue.

I was beaten quite often, the last time at the age of 14, my parents - my mother doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my father has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I was terribly angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they gave me a good spanking, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, I used to fight a lot when I was little, now I at least hit something to discharge my anger, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get punched in the mouth too much), so it's never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'll lose patience with my children and do the same.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply fucks something up, it is probably impossible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of such quality pussies.
Otherwise, I would like to know whether you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have enough to pay the mortgage?

For their study, the scientists are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect known as valgus ankles.
Valgosity of the ankles is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is normally treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis in order to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can register for the study via the website, where the registration form and all information is available.
The researchers are looking for 50 children with a diagnosis and 50 healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should enrol their child is when they take their first independent steps, for example, when they typically let go of the furniture they are holding on to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements over the course of seven months from the child's first steps, each of which takes about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants it also involves wearing the tested shoes," points out Gimunová.
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia take the trial of Kuciak's killers?
The main hearing in the trial of four people accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman, Marian Kočner, and his connections to the top echelons of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How significant a turning point will the trial be for Slovakia?
Sparta is really busy this year, admits Hradec Králové defender Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec Králové hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play in Friday's game against the club where he recently played. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be similarly motivated, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to do well against Sparta," says the Hradec back before the match of the 5th extra-league round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which currently includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno and Pilsen, the most appreciated by fans came on Sunday, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't look at the games as they were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now, and play them in the same way, if not better," the Hradec Králové defender points out.
Hradec should not look back at last year's record with Sparta. They lost three out of four games, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, the Sparta management brought in several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but let's face it, this year they are really busy," admits Nedomlel before the first game at the end of this week.
And the second? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.

Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they allowed themselves to be fooled, and society paid the price.
Just six months ago, people were dying of Covid on Czech television.
Lucie Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she had to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is originally a seamstress and her real name is Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That's when the singer was born in me," she admitted to Impulsu radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"My dad always said: 'Skill girl, skill. Walk with your feet on the ground!' He even tried to persuade me to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks no longer works, but I sort of do. I'm a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction off at auctions and use the money to buy wheelchairs," she added with a laugh.

Comment by Jan Šindelář: Managing railways as a company
The heavenly election, even if it was not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story of the inability of the state to give a clear direction to the roads. The board has been incomplete for over a year and even after Wednesday evening it does not change because one of the members resigned. The provisional period continues.
The selection process itself was a farce from the start, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practical experience, were significantly eased. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate had worked in the past were reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board only played the role of pimps.
Nebeský presented probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced players from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in the political game.
Maybe Nebeský will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best head of railways of all time. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political smoke. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalization of the market and with a shortage of employees in operation. Train drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What kind of motivation for further work and respect for management should they have when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in a china shop?
The second important group is the creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the railways next spring, when the railways defend the rating. It is certain that the creditors perceive instability. It is sad that someone else goes to Moody's every year to defend the rating for České dráhy. The agency has not missed frequent changes in the management of the railways and political influence on the company, it criticized them already this summer.
The ANO movement promotes, among other things, the slogan that the state should be managed like a company. For starters, it would be enough if one large state-owned company was managed like a company and not like a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it were managed by the best. They applied, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive ourselves the antics of the selection process.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and approval of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government suspended the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on a repository, as mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The municipalities criticise the draft law by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given locality.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Authority to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted project proposal almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not really have many options to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for a repository.
Only in certain licensing procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister in whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A possible lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the implementation of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-governments, which the Platform calls for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and certainly in those where they have already advanced in the authorization of the repository, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for this work amounts to almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only deferred to their successors the settlement of the position of local governments vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against the Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep repository.
The platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared off by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman has gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new physique in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large frame was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
"I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore," Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's a text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, for example, or a university text, I would probably be looking for how to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the lord / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not face them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is simply not possible to translate "boss" in a general, one-word way; Czech and other languages do not solve this problem in any way (only Catalan, which translates "boss" as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is, in short, for the story or the game in general, a significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
And where are the spectators? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, because by going to Doha, athletics has voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere that prevailed at the sold-out stadium in London in 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of Doha's skyscrapers are calling for "the biggest sporting event of 2019," but concerns are growing about how dignified the backdrop will be.
"Tickets for the finish are sold out for all evenings," say the organisers.
But this is too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators, is already covered with brightly colored sails, on which the flags of the 209 participating countries are also depicted. In Qatar, athletics has ventured into territory where, despite the annual Diamond League meeting, it does not have deep roots.
It is therefore not surprising that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for the ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, i.e. less than 400 crowns.
The organisers have now set themselves the goal of filling the uncovered sections of the stands by at least half, which is why, according to sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, they are allegedly (although the organisers themselves deny it) handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as labourers, as well as to children, which Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF athletics association, is able to comment on positively: "This is how we can inspire the next generation."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, and after athletics, football will be next in 2022. Financial offers from the oil superpower will always be lucrative, even for wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot help but sigh with pure sport that the IAAF leaders should have timed the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes on the Arabian Peninsula better - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the entire scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally begin for athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for this with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises an ultramodern and attractive championship. Is it really 37 degrees? Even now, the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are also supposed to give television viewers a detailed look at what is happening in the athletes in the hundredths of a second before the starter's shot and just after it.
The whole world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police are also involved in the search.
They have been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště since 7 December.
It is also helping the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
A declared search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
He described her as being 5'10" (168cm) tall, thin with brown eyes and long straight hair the same colour.
It should come from Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are concerned for her as it is unusual for her to go missing
Local MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She took part in putting up flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
However, it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorised by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
We noticed a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
For the time being, the attackers' strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email is designed to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its title, this time it was marked as "Copy of correction of receipt for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as the e-mail clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic over the past few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment as well as the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of around four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or sectors of the population has led to them finding common ground.
The anti-vaxxers, anti-whistle-blowers and co. alone would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the Chcípl pes association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Million Moments for Democracy in Reverse.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose vaccine.
It won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists, of which mankind is justly proud.
No more stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power, were unable to come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" shot footage has become a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been sought by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer and an MP representing the part of London where she lived are also appealing for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is completely out of character and we are becoming very concerned for her welfare," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work at around 19:45 on Sunday 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing by a co-worker on December 3.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact police," the statement continued.
The Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) was reported by an anonymous person as infringing copyright with her paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that Krteček's paintings in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a manhole without a cover.
Lives were at stake.
The municipality referred the complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RMD began to "intensively deal with the situation."
Microplastics have reached human intestines, study confirms for the first time
A team led by the professor of the University of Vienna, Philipp Schwabl, has published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human faeces. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - nevertheless, tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in the samples of all examined persons. None of the eight subjects was a vegetarian, six of them did not avoid sea fish, they all drank water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing were found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the disintegration of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soft drinks; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the human digestive tract has therefore only been officially confirmed. There were approximately 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in their bodies.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness suspect that this is not good. However, mankind still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on the "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or into the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind and confirms what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thus facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will be to at least stop its steep increase. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years humanity will consume a fifth more than today. The current rate is a staggering one million bottles purchased per minute. Every year, approximately eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already introduced restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example, has banned plastic bags - under the threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small bans (the well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, claim that such measures, although nice, are completely inadequate.
