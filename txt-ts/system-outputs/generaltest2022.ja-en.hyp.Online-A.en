When I tried to buy the entry package, I came across a blue and orange package.
The orange color is more than double the price.
What's the difference?
Please let me know because I didn't understand it even after researching.
Right now, there should be nothing but blue.
If there is, it may just be that the old product remains.
Both are the same just because they look different.

Was the Destiny Plan in Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny an eight-hit game that Durandal was touched by Talia?
Is it that genetically correct because she broke up with Talia because she couldn't have children because of a genetic mismatch?
I think the destiny plan is to do it thoroughly, so I think there are eight hits.

I finally got my Social Security Number
Ever since I was in the U.S., I called again and again for an interview appointment, and then I called again and again again a month later without a word, and finally got the appointment and it took almost a month to finally get it, saying it would arrive within two weeks.

I don't feel like watching TV anymore because of that...
Does that mean that the entertainer has become impossible? Television is full of comedians.
I saw Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there are quite a lot of scenes where the staff laughs in the back even when they are saying something that is not particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's eerie to laugh at everything you say because you're a sell-good comedian.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be spoiled, and it will be unpalatable in terms of work.
Like the black companies of old, that industry is like a sports day, and some entertainers' egos are too big and they seem to have a normal disgusting attitude, otherwise they won't be able to eat.
On the other hand, there are so many theories that comedians themselves say "Don't lick the comedians" every time they feel that the difficulty of their work is high.
I know that my income is pretty low until I can sell it, but even if I am constantly told that a comedian is at the top of the top job category where work is not good.
It sounds like nothing more than a justification for the glorification of one's own career and the fact that comedians are too high a position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is also quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the world of entertainers are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt that it was not good for my body if I didn't take it out like a farts ...

The product ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission
Summary: When I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheaper, I received a wired version of the mouse and was told to return it if I wanted a refund
It is a mail-order trouble rather than a topic of self-made PC, but I am not convinced no matter how I think about it, and it is a famous place, so I will write it here
It started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen (link destination Uotaku) at the Tsukumo Day sale of Tsukumo Net Shop that started from the previous Friday
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I checked the wired version page considering the possibility of price error, and it was 5,071 yen (linked to Uotaku), so I ordered thinking about the possibility that it was not a mistake
I received the order email successfully, and the next day I also received the shipping e-mail
IN THESE TWO EMAILS AND IN THE PURCHASE HISTORY ON MY PAGE, THE NAME OF "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written
Since there was no notification of mistakes or cancellation notifications from order to shipment, I thought at this point that the ordered wireless mouse would arrive
This is the problem, and a few hours after shipment, I received an email saying that "there was a mistake in registering the product"
According to that email
* The wireless version was sold at a sale price, but it was actually a wired version
* Since we have already shipped wired mice,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return the mouse only and get a refund
3. Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose your response
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and although it is written as the wireless version in the purchase history, email, and delivery note, it seems that it was replaced with the wired version without permission and sent
Isn't it terrible that something different from the one you bought is sent without your consent, and if you want a refund, you can return it from here?
Even if you accept a refund in the end, please lend wisdom because you want to fight back one shot

Isolated twice... Typhoon and heavy rain cause only bridge to be leaked Residents triple their food stockpiles< Yashi-cho > Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto of Kōchihara District, Yashiri-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "At first, it was like, 'Are you serious?'
I was wondering if it would break so quickly or be swept away" The only road leading to the Kochihara district, the Kochihara Bridge, was swept away by a typhoon Japan the east, leaving 30 people from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off the water continued to carry necessary supplies using the JR iron bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "Normally, you can come to the garden by car, but when you get out of the car there, you will walk across the iron bridge with your hand or on your back, so I felt the gratitude of transportation and cars" The emergency bridge, which was completed a month later, was swept away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to somehow secure enough for 2 to 3 days" We prepared about three times as much food that can be used for emergency food, such as canned foods and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, and I don't know when a disaster will befall me, so I felt again that it would be better for everyone to do a little stockpiling" On the other hand, Yashicho experienced an "unexpected disaster" in which a bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lessons, the town began its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Director of the Yashiri Town Education Division: "We have established it in the form of 'Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day,' and we have also announced that we want October 12 to be a day to think about disaster prevention preparations from next year onwards.
I think I'm more aware than ever about the possibility of the unexpected."

Since the test itself is almost over, all that is left is to write a sentence, but we are also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is correct, so please wait a little.

・ The sound of waving a weapon

Be careful when purchasing a second-hand house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
● Newly established "Building Condition Survey" System to Revitalize the Used Housing Market Second-hand housing transactions are doing well.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a home has increased due to the corona disaster, the popularity of properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station" "large-scale" and "tower" that are soaring has concentrated, and it may also be affected by the drastic decrease in relatively cheap new construction properties.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still low.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a survey called "inspection", a building condition survey aimed at trading safe and secure second-hand houses (https: / / www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ).
This is a system in which architects who are familiar with housing check the current situation including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarize it in a report, and present it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because the seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sales transaction, and gives the buyer a sense of security.
This in turn will lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer side, it is a system that can grasp the condition of the second-hand house to be purchased, and can purchase it with conviction, and at first glance it is a system with great merit.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in the investigation of the building situation.
In addition, I would like to note that only the notification of the inspection system became obligatory.
In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of brokerage is obliged to explain that "when brokering a property, you can introduce an architect who investigates the building situation" or "you can not do it", but the implementation itself is not obligatory.
● Risks of concern due to seller-led inspections On the other hand, turning to overseas, similar systems have already been established in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.
In the preliminary stage of home sales, buyers ask experts called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" to inspect the building.
For example, in the case of the United States, inspections are carried out in 70 ~ 90% of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection, the Japan type inspection of the main "seller" and its nature are very different.
The seller tries to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it as high as possible and as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the investigation, make appropriate repairs, and live with peace of mind.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a gap between the purpose and thoughts of both sides.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out regarding the Japan system as risks of concern.
● The scope of investigation for seller-driven inspections established by the state will be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking a really important defect ● For inspection companies, the brokerage company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be the customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that a "disrespectful" inspection such as not reporting the results of the investigation against the seller may be carried out.

It was pretty hard.
However, mentally I was cured (?) So I was full of motivation.
Because I was in a research position because my body couldn't keep up, I fell asleep while working.
It was the second time in the year, so I took a month off and thought lightly that I was going to say goodbye to the garbage company, but it was more severe than I thought it would be, and the medicine didn't match up, so it dragged on.
Anyway, it is important to go to a psychiatrist and have it dealt with correctly, and to leave a history of hospital visits (super important)
If you have a history of hospital visits, even if you leave the company for personal reasons, you can change to retirement for company reasons at the discretion of the doctor in Hallowa, so the hurdle to receive unemployment insurance etc. will be lowered to the damn

We will introduce the trivia of Ginza that is interesting to know and you will surely want to talk to someone.
Going above Ginza! ?
First infiltration into Kinza
When you walk in Ginza, there are strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, many shrines, and other remnants of the history carved by the land of Ginza everywhere.
I was walking in Ginza with her, and the silence that came unexpectedly said, "This was a peninsula in the past.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
The synonym for the downtown area that created "○○ Ginza" in various places in Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza office that was located in present-day Shizuoka City moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Money Exchange Town", but when it moved to Momo-cho it came to be called "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" that jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, the cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo-maejima" stretched from Japan Bridge to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the coves and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.
Ieyasu also improved the city blocks and built moats to develop boat transportation.
They then cut down the soil that had been carved out of the moat and Mt. Kanda, and reclaimed the cove.
In addition, in front of the Tiffany & Co. Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of "Ginza Birthplace" that shows the site of the Ginza Office, so if you are interested, why not look for it?
Ginza's "Pilgrimage to the Holy Land" known to those in the know
In Ginza, the "Ginza Hachichō Shrine Tour" is held every year, a "pilgrimage to the holy place" known to those in the know.
Among the more than 10 sacred sites, the most conspicuous is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of Kabuki-za.
At the shrine that stands at the far right of the Kabuki-za, there are not a few people who visit before and after the theater.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoka" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Ideyo Jizo Zōzō" is located on the Ginza terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine" and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley and are difficult to stand out, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to have been revered by Kabuki master Ichimura Hasaemon and the "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the 1st floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting the Hachichō Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places that enshrine the Fudo Akio and Jizo Bodhisattvas, but most of the shrines have Inari as a deity.
The "Inarisha" that the fox greets in front of the shrine was built in a hurry because of the benefits of "five grain fertility" where rice is often grown in places where there are many farmers.
In turn, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said that there were benefits of prosperous business, and faith spread even in Ginza, the busiest downtown area in Japan.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist because my front teeth were aching and I had a sore pain like hypersensitivity when I pressed or touched them.
The nerves have been pulled out and the hole is still there.
I said it was to make the pain go away faster.
If you touch the tooth before treatment, severe pain will run, but will it subside in a few days ...
Painkillers don't work at all...
After a few days, you will calm down.
I think it hurts the most right now.

Man found dead in Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
Just before noon on the 12th, a man was found lying face down and dead in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya.
Police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to the police, just before 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidanmi, Moriyama Ward, and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river but was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police are rushing to confirm his identity and are investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Sunagawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and his death was confirmed.
There was no disturbance in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle lying nearby.
Police are rushing to confirm the identity and are investigating the situation at the time.

Korea Posco International acquires Australia's SENEX Energy and expands overseas gas field business = Korean press (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced today that it has signed an agreement to acquire a stake in Senex Energy in Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, Senex Energy is still in the process of passing the bill at the general meeting of shareholders and approving the local subsidiary, and the acquisition is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This acquisition marks the largest global merger and acquisitions (M&A) since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which Posco International will invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy will invest 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it has decided to acquire this acquisition because it believes that the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that Blue Hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will split the market together with Green Hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
The acquisition will also secure natural gas reserves of 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf), equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel to operate onshore gas fields in Australia.

Originally, February was only the 11th of the National Foundation Day, but since the current emperor was born in February, the 23rd is a national holiday.

That knee pain, maybe "knee osteoarthritis"! ?
Treatments for Different Causes (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor's note: I've been having knee pain lately.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common Japan is "osteoarthritis".
Editor's note: Do you mean that the joints become deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, and it is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, strenuous sports, etc., cartilage may wear out or become distorted.
As a result, it leads to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor's note: Does osteoarthritis develop beyond the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and groins of the fingers of the hand, neck, hips, big toes, hips, etc.
However, the most common case is that it occurs in the knee, and it is called "knee osteoarthritis".
Editorial Department: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: In joints, two bones are combined in an uneven manner.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the periphery of the joint is wrapped in "joint capsule".
Editor: It's a complicated structure.
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
In the lining of the joint capsule, there is a tissue called synovial membrane that makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements".
Editorial Department: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articulated cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly.
In other words, it plays a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn out or distorted, the joint will be deformed or inflamed, causing pain.

3 Gambling & Games in the Kaiji Series (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the best things about this game is the extreme game where you risk your life.
【Photos】Just looking at it makes my legs cringe ... ... Challenge to cross the steel frame!
So this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's game that can be actually played or practiced in the planning video.
■ Numa It is a pachinko "swamp" full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Busting Book Kaiji".
In the original work, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" was set up with large traps of "Nailing Forest", "Movable Characters", and "3-Stage Kroon", and it was considered almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all sorts of tricks, and in the end, he went on a rough task of placing a plastic water tank in the building to subside and tilt the ground, and he captured it brilliantly.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball" and the difficulty level has been reduced, but you can still taste the feeling of Kaiji.
Steel Crossing At the "Starside Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, the debtors, including Kaiji, were forced to perform the steel crossing of the "Human Horse Race".
The debtors compete for speed by devising ways to avoid falling on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
There are 12 contestants, and the top two will win the prize, but there are only 4 steel frames, inadequate safety measures, and a good chance of death.
Although this steel frame crossing is highly dangerous, it was developed as a VR game, and you can experience it very close at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", the home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.
This eagle bridge has a single steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and after that, "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared, and you can walk to it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi made headlines on his YouTube page when he posted a video of himself walking on the Eagle Bridge, claiming that "you can experience the crossing of steel frames in Japan."
■ E-Card A two-player card game, "E-card".
The player uses 10 cards, including 1 Emperor's Card, 8 Citizen Cards, and 1 Slave Card, and is played on the Emperor's side and the slave side.
The game is very well done, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji faces Tonegawa under the strict rule that if you lose, you can have your ears cut off.
After a great struggle, Kaiji eventually realized that an earphone-destroying device attached to his ear was reading his mind by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and he defeated Tonegawa by cutting his ears to the limit and making his body abnormal.
E-cards are available on the market and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of himself competing with Ryuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, on an e-card, which caused a stir.
■ Is it also possible to taste the kaiji mood?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read the manga, you will only get a feeling.
Why don't you feel that world view through the game?
One step towards the New Year, gently boosted Tora's Daiema | Yamagata Shimbun at the prefectural Gokoku Shrine
At the prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are progressing, next year's Chinese zodiac sign "Tora" Daiema appeared.
Students from Tohoku University of Arts and Technology, who designed the shrine, visited the shrine on the 11th and held a dedication festival in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has commissioned students of the University of Arts and Technology to draw original drawings of emas.
This time, from among the paintings by nine people in the Japan Painting Course of the Department of Fine Arts under the guidance of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was adopted.
Ōema is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.
Tsuchiya says he painted it with "an image of a cherry blossom gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
The tiger stops and looks at the cherry blossoms with the hope that "even in a world that is changing drastically, we can afford to admire the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on Ema that is distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said: "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano I want to continue living in" Proposal for 4 high school students in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | Ms. Desi
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano I want to continue living in."
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai Creation Center, an interim support organization, we will summarize the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayors.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, students would answer questions such as "When you get excited with a lot of people" or "When you are beating the drums."
The first meeting was held on November 13 at the Sunrise Fureai Kaikan.
Using the "World Cafe" method, in which 18 high school students and local people discuss while moving around the "island" with a specific theme, they thought about "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns that feel a sense of purpose in life."
Write down each idea on a sticky note and paste it on imitation paper to organize it.
"A town with many young people looks interesting" and "Transportation such as trains and buses are indispensable for livability".
We will discuss further whether there are any similarities.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle by the seaside is attractive," says an 18-year-old third-year student at Tamano Shoko High School.
An 18-year-old third-year student at Binan High School said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it is nice to have a place rich in nature," and by talking with adults, he seemed to have noticed not only the challenges of the region but also the attractiveness.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the proposals.
The mayor and superintendent of education are scheduled to make an announcement in February next year.
The center's president, Rie Higashi, said, "I hope it will foster a love of hometown among high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to take the initiative in community development."

How to find a new way to roll a stall (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It is an indispensable stall in winter, but there are times when the cloth sticks at the neck.
It is good to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding, but sometimes I hear voices saying that they do not know the ropes.
If the cloth doesn't stick and you have a stall that can be rolled up quickly... When I thought about it, I found something novel.
The stall of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which feels more compact than the general one.
When I first saw it, I was like, "Can I wind it up so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is made into a single piece by knitting an elongated cut cloth, and the whole thing is mesh-shaped.
The mesh is threaded through the end of the stall.
So, even if you don't tie the ends together, you can wind and fasten them.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular even in jackets, but many people wear them in combination with a stall so that the shoulders do not get cold.
I think it will be convenient to have such a stall.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's a guy called Get Buck directed by Peter Jackson.
It's raw or life-size Beatles and it's fresh in a lot of ways...
It's just before the break-up, so I'm giggling, but it's not the dramatic giggling I imagined.
Paul who is annoying like "I know I'm a jerk but come on!" while trying hard to partition, George who is a jerk and says, "But..." and John who calmly says opinions and jokes but is late and unmotivated ... Ringo, who plays the role of a soothsayer, didn't actively interject so much, and sat behind me with a face that said, "I'm in trouble."
We don't hate each other enough to fight each other like that, but there's a certain feeling in the air of "Well, we can't work together anymore," and the Beatles were like that, which is interesting, it's kind of like the dismantling of legends.
And even in such an atmosphere, when you start playing, everyone is really full of talent.
The process of starting from a small phrase to making it into "that famous song" while each other is doing "How about this?" is ridiculous.
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is made is amazing.
It is amazing that the scene where the nasal song like a casual hoon hoon gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics enter is well recorded
It's amazing to see the process of composition like this.
Also, it's natural, but everyone is greasy so you can be happy just by watching the performance scene
It seems to be one of the three episodes yet, but so far I was under the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them start writing songs while complaining about something, and it looks like fun, but what about the live venue? When it came to talking about it, it was easy to understand that producers and publicity men would say things like "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!" and that they had already left their hands.
Well, documentaries also have directorial interpretations, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising, so I thought that may be the reason why Paul has many scenes that are rather bad guys

I changed jobs from a sales position because I was sick to death, but at that time I was not good at doing sales activities from myself, but I thought that it was very suitable for sales activities that are needed by customers, so it is a different industry, but if I choose such a job and change jobs, it became very easy to work.
You said things that you couldn't do, but if you can find something that you are good at and what you can do even a little, I think your way of life will be a little easier in the future.
←Of course, I think it's okay to think about this until you have a good rest and a lot of room in your mind.
However, I think that there are also daily life, so if there is a company union, an industrial physician, or a contact point where you can consult, if you consult there, there may be some kind of system, so it seems that it is good to consult once.
It would be nice if you could live your life with a little more ease in the future.

Tornado Outbreak Causes Major Damage in the U.S. Unseasonably Warm and Strong Cold Air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of Friday the 10th to Saturday the 11th, tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern part of the United States.
It was a record warmth for this period, but due to the influence of strong cold air moving southward, the atmospheric condition became very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds seem to have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, bringing the temperature to a record high.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday, September 9 and Friday, May 10, local time, has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
In the midst of this record-breaking warmth, strong cold air of -30°C or less moved southward around 5,500 m above the ground, so an active front was formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes appear to have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States is a region prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage at this time.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during the winter season, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and wind gusts on Friday the 10th, local time.
According to this, there are two main concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (Improved Fujita Scale), which indicates the strength of tornadoes, reached EF3, the third of the six strongest scales, and it is thought that gusts of wind of around 70 m/s blew instantaneously.
Depending on future investigations, it may be judged to be EF4~5.
In Japan, JEF (Japan version of the Improved Fujita Scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale, which is tailored to the situation of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, which is equivalent to this American tornado, is quite likely to occur even in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses collapse.

U.S. Tornado 'Biggest in History' Calls for Help in Live Broadcast from Under Rubble (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and Southern United States, U.S. President Joe Biden said on the 11th (Japan hours 12th) that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States" with a mysterious face.
CNN television and others reported.
Biden emphasized that "the federal government will do everything."
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he explained.
The death toll is expected to exceed 100.
Pictured: Residents carrying household belongings from damaged homes in Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado More than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, between the night of the 10th and the dawn of the 11th.
The tornado damage was recorded at 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in 1925 when it caused damage to Missouri and other states, but CNN weather experts estimated that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers), which was the largest.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was heavily damaged, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
There were 110 people working at the time, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of it.
A woman trapped in the darkness under a nearly 1.5-metre-thick debris felt the weight of rescuers searching for it and called for help via a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of women calling for help, the live broadcast also included screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which another woman supposedly sang while crying to dispel her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe hiding in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"A lot of people liken it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrible sound, like a reverberation of the earth where something more was going to erupt," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police officer said, "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months, years it will be," he said, continuing his strenuous rescue efforts.
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead after a warehouse at online shopping giant Amazon collapsed.
Train cars have been derailed by such an impact that they are cut off, and highways have also been blocked one after another due to the influence of rolling over vehicles.
According to U.S. web media, about 400,000 homes in total are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.
I have fewer platelets.
What can I do to make it more so?

It has long been said that there is a difference in thinking about the star rating system.
The argument is that other countries deduct points from the five stars as a standard, while Japan add or deduct points from the three stars as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars have completely different meanings between "there is a deduction element" and "it is not a masterpiece, but it is an honorable mention".
If you use 5 stars as a standard, "works with only no flaws" and "works of the highest standard in all" will be in the same row, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of stars, but since such a system is actually operated in such a way, I would like you not to give 3 stars (bad publicity).

Self-Made Radio Volume
I made an AM radio with my own condenser and coil, but there was so much noise that I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio for a while, but I heard a radio that was different from the frequency I tuned.
It's possible that the tuning was too sweet and didn't sound right, but it wasn't what I expected.
The main topic here is that I should have made an AM radio, but I heard FM radio.
Why do you think that? Is there such a thing?

Saga Shimbun News > Saga Shimbun News  Living and |Culture of "Hakobune" "Seasonal Fish and Shrimp Caught in the Inshore Sea Homemade Tartare Sauce" | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE<
Bento box "Seasonal fish and shrimp fried caught in the near sea, homemade tartar sauce"
"hakobune" is a colorful bento box using plenty of vegetables and takeout specialty store of deli (side dishes).
"So that you can feel like a restaurant at home," said Takayuki Katsuki, 39, and Yumi, 38, who opened the restaurant last August.
One of the popular bento menus is "Seasonal fish and shrimp fried in the near sea, homemade tartar sauce" ( 1000 yen ).
Fish are chosen from time to time in the market.
"The raw bread crumbs are made as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients in the fried shrimp," says Takayuki, and the crisp texture of the fried shrimp can be seen directly.
The bento box includes about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli to accompany the deli, and rice and soup with millet grains in the rice of Hinohikari from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are homemade in the buckwheat field and purchased at direct sales outlets in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the time of year, but Takayuki has trained in French, and things like lapée and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, it has a "familiar and relaxing taste" like a dashi rolled egg, and it is a Japanese-Western eclectic that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
The bento box "Tegone hamburger of domestic aibiki meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the company will also release the Charcuterie Set, a processed meat product suitable for wine and other alcoholic beverages.

There was something interesting at Haneda Airport that I happened to stop by, so I tried using it
Ride comfort Not so bad, but sometimes it shakes (not so much as to get drunk)
Speed Naturally slow
Safety When there are people around, the speed is slowed down, and in some cases it stops completely, so I think it is safe for the time being, but I thought it was dangerous depending on the place
The gaze around you hurts, it's good to be seen, but it's painful to be seen with a feeling of "it's a distraction", the heart hurts
Overall Comment It's not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It is a pity that it becomes easier to use if there are a little fewer people or if you give consideration such as stopping by the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to make a dedicated lane so that it does not interfere with other people walking.
However, because it is relaxed, I can relax while looking at the scenery, so I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little fewer people.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a fairly patient mind with excitement due to the near-future feeling that this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the gaze of the surroundings is comfortable.

If you look very closely, you may understand this, but I do not use eel at all.
Actually, "! Eggplant!" It is! (Tap to get the correct answer.)
I like eels, but in fact everyone is eating it with sauce, and I thought that the eel part was actually anything other than baking ... I thought that the texture and quantity of the eel were important.
I didn't want the eel to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat the eel.

Man slashed and fled on a man's motorcycle Saga Shimbun News | Attempted murder in Saga City Daizai on the 12th| Saga Shimbun News |Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on the street of Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, injuring himself in the face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and the Saga South Police Department is tracking him as an attempted murder.
According to the South Police Department, a passer-by called 110 to report that they were "fighting."
The man suffered injuries to his left cheek, about 10 centimeters long and about a centimeter deep, but he is said to be conscious.
The man who ran away was a skinhead with medium meat.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
The man said he had been drinking with several acquaintances and suspected that there was some kind of traffic trouble between the pedestrian man and the motorcycle man.

The Long Road of a Family Who Rooted Environmental Conservation in China's Frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Hong Kong Company Find Asia Corporate Consultant) With its vast land area, China is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest variety of mammals and the world's third largest plant species.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection but also the activities of environmental activists.
Sisapanna (西双版納), Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such region.
His sister Lee is currently working as an actress Sisapanna is a region bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people, who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flows.
Sisapanna Tai (西双版納傣族) Autonomous Prefecture The area of Sisapanna is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of wild animals and 20% of plants.
This time, we met Mr. Li Wan-hu, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna on site, and talked about the contents of his activities.
■ Started environmental protection activities with my German husband ― I heard about 20 years of environmental protection activities.
What was the impetus for this?
Mr. Lee: Our environmental protection activity "Tianxuan" started its activities in 2000.
It was triggered by my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It was the only rainforest region in China and boasted some of the most biodiversity.
However, at the same time, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, large-scale logging of the rainforest was previously promoted in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study natural resources and biological resources.
Then he met me, who was a reporter here, and we got married.
― ― Didn't Mr. Li have any interest in nature conservation before then?
Ms. Lee: I'm from Sisapanna but I had no interest in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who don't have a well-formed face or are not particularly tall, but have an aura, but why do you think that's why?

Aura is not something you want to put out.

I wonder if it is fine to say that the other person's clothes are good or the color is good?
It's not detailed, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been told to compliment and be detailed, so I don't know what you mean.
I guess I complimented him in detail.
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"Sakura-san confessed, my heart is in full bloom, please come here," I replied, and I will accompany you.
And in order to get along, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.

【Oma Ring/Personal Remembrance】 MODs that are causing CTDs in their own environment and took about a month and a half to identify
Until March, there was stable data from around GW and CTDs due to multiple factors had occurred while I didn't have much time to play, and it took a lot of time to identify them as I looked them up little by little only on holidays.
Why. Why didn't you parse the logs in the Net Script Framework (and you'll find out in a few minutes).dll?
〇 Main CTD timing
* All papyrus and. Net Script Framework, a type of logging.dll plug-ins that leave no footprint in the logs.
* When some NPCs are killed/attacked: Activated even by console kill→ Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree SE update resumption version) Improved with OFF * Is there a possibility of false accusations about this?
* Basic improvement by turning off the kill move setting by PC via .ini when the camera work activates the kill move for some NPCs→ DAR+Nemesis-related setting conflict? However, the number of DAR animations, let alone the upper limit, has not reached 10,000.
* (Basic Outdoor) Field Movement + Some Magic (Example: Freezing Runes) Activated, NPC Hits: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID Use NPC Application Settings (top right of MCM) All OFF and all improved in 5 consecutive trials.
Could some actor/NPCs wear additional armor or body mesh due to misshader settings? Note that the default .ini using SPID in 2.0 is a typographical error, but as a result, it will be the intended result and the premise Perk should be applied to the NPC.
Initially, I focused on checking the parts attack and OnHit-related motion/combat mods (.dll ones) by falsely accusing them, but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German and French levels.
If by any chance there are people who have similar CTD problems in Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reminder, so I posted it.
Everyone is doing it with a last-minute mentality,
People don't notice it, not to mention their colleagues and family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that this person seems to be struggling but is doing well and doing well.
But perhaps he's mentally fit too.
I didn't retire mentally, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Visiting Nursing - After Today's Visiting Nursing
I suffer from bipolar disorder, so I have been receiving visiting nursing care for a long time, but I have had a long relationship with the nurse (female) at the visiting nursing station I am currently using, and I think I have built a very good relationship.
We talk a lot every week.
Of course, they also do things necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything else, I realized how important it is for people with mental illness to have fun communication.
Today we talked about gender differences between men and women, or we also discussed gender theory.
Is it okay to talk about the libido of a man and a woman, or why she got divorced, or anything like that? I also talk about things like that.
Sometimes, I'm dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of the visiting nurse station that psychiatric hospitals are doing, I have heard from acquaintances that an aunty nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only responds to clerical work, or that an occupational therapist comes to visit nursing but gives instructions from above such as "I am doing medical care here."
What I use is a small visiting nurse station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think she is a really good nurse who frankly faces me as an equal person with mental illness.
By the way, you are a beautiful person lol.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric visiting nursing, and there are also people who are thinking about receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves of it, take it.
And let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I couldn't match the warpage, so I canceled the contract from here.
Sorry for the pun.

Why does it come out in English?

・ I do not know what the person who made it will be displayed in the Japanese
- Trouble with language judgment
・ Browser setting is given priority to English

Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementation of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Chung-Ang Ilbo Japanese Edition) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government released a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be deployed (cumulative total) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only at the 27% target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from the time of the announcement of the roadmap.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap was well below the target.
The Japan Business Federation (Zenkeiren) released a report titled "Current Status of the Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem and Policy Direction" on November 12.
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, which is the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane membranes are supplied by DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.).
The number of patents on hydrogen technology in the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020), Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, the Japan Business Federation said, "In fact, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which in fact means that they are at the bottom of the competition among the competing countries."
The ranking of patents by country is in the order of China, the United States, the European Union, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the United States to become No. 1, and the gap has widened.

Other than daily payments, I think it's probably tough if you don't have an address.
And the daily payment seems to be tough if you do not have a contact (phone number)
In addition, an address is required for a line contract.

Don't forget because securing an address is a top priority

Parliament on Sunday?
, TV program style flyer creation Parliamentary reform underway in Takasu, "correspondence book" of lawmakers also : Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic edition
Takasu: The Town Council is working on unique council reforms, such as the creation of outlandish leaflets announcing the holding of regular meetings and the introduction of a "correspondence book" in which townspeople evaluate councillors.
The town council election has been held without a vote for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
In order to publicize the Sunday Parliament held on the 12th, about 1,800 new leaflets were distributed in newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Raw Gillon from the Morning" "Tetsuko's Room" "Hitoshi Sawaguchi Exploration Series" ... . .
The leaflet distributed by the town council to all the houses on the 9th has words reminiscent of the name of a popular TV program.
Councillor Hyoue Katayama, 43, who created the report, said, "I want you to come to the Parliament with a chuckle."

U.S. Helps Arms and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engages in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) - U.S. State Department officials reported Thursday that equipment including firearms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security aid program approved by President Biden.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (US$6.8 billion), and the last piece of equipment, including four radars that identify mortars and other launch sites, will be delivered to Ukraine at the start of the year.
Pentagon spokesman Kirby said the aid also included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The military support is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's national defense capabilities in response to the military buildup that the Russian military is advancing around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. is also becoming more vigilant about Russian military moves and is consulting with NATO members to develop measures in case Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms assistance when Ukrainian President Zelenskiy visited the White House on September 1 this year.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has reached more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian army.
Last month, it dispatched the U.S. Florida National Guard in accordance with a joint multilateral training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a statement from the Pentagon, the U.S. Special Operations Command in Europe also plays a major role in training and advising Ukraine's special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a classified matter for the course of the operation.
President Joe Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 7, and there were tense exchanges in the Ukraine situation.
The U.S. is also poised to impose tough sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes gifts during life "prohibited", directly hit Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP Tax Commission!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of Weekly Diamond is titled "Family Talk During the New Year's Holidays!"
Gift-making and last-minute inheritance techniques during one's lifetime."
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, the outlines of the tax reform for fiscal 2022 that were feared were postponed, but there is a strong possibility that gifts made during one's lifetime, which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures, will become a "prohibited hand" in the near future.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Along with a direct hit on Akira Amari, a former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission and a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for bargain last-minute gifts in time for the end of this year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara )
● From wealthy people to urban office workers to "prohibit" gifts during their lifetime "From the viewpoint of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-fledged studies toward the establishment of a tax system that is neutral to the choice of the timing of asset transfer."
The ruling party's announcement last year of the outline of the fiscal 2021 tax reform system caused widespread unrest not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what he is trying to say is to drastically change the rules of inheritance and to raise the inheritance tax greatly by making "gifts before birth", which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures, "forbidden hands".
The iron law of tax saving measures for highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce taxable property".
The gift during his lifetime, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who incur inheritance tax even though it is a small amount due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of all this, the debate on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax arose.
Although it was postponed in the FY2010 Tax Reform Outline released on December 10, 2010, which was feared to be introduced as soon as possible, "We will review the current taxation system for settlement at the time of inheritance and the calendar year gift system" and "We will constantly review the gift tax exemption measure because it is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount ... A policy toward unification was once again set out with more in-depth wording.
In an interview with this editorial department, Akira Amari, the former chairman of the LDP's former tax research committee and former secretary-general Akira Amari, said.
"The most important thing is to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of property transfer and to keep the tax burden the same whenever you go.
At the moment, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (by integration)" If it is the fastest revision, there are three remaining chances of lifetime gifts.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future there will be a major shift in the direction of invalidating pre-birth gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly will the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Right Brother" Terrestrial Broadcasting from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa "Please Stay Tuned!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
【Photo】 Hana Jun Yamatani as the heroine Based on the manga of the same name by Satoshi Morie, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" from 2018, this work is a love story of too much pure love between a man and a woman who bear the past.
The protagonist Kairi is played by Furukawa, and the heroine Riyo is portrayed by Hana Jun Yamatani.
Riyo, a college student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly if he borrows Riyo's shoulder for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has a resemblance to her older brother, who was separated due to her parents' divorce, but for some reason, Kairi is a murderer.
・Yudai Furukawa Comment The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10th!
I hope that those who did not see it on FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will know more deeply about this work if they know the development, see the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Risei, and the state of the two people who struggle and change.
I hope that fans of the original work will also enjoy it.
Stay tuned!

[NFL] Team that won by 3 passes per game, what and how did the players feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw a pass = only three passes for the Patriots.
This was the fewest number in the NFL in the past 50 years since the two passes Bills recorded in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
The Bills in 1974 had an unworldly genius RB named O.J. Simpson who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
Bills overwhelmed the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and in terms of latitude it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was almost 1 degree Celsius, the wind speed was 18 meters, and there was a snowstorm before the game.
The Bills were only local, so they didn't change their play choices much.
He had 25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, and it wasn't a bad one.
In 10 offensive series, there were four red zone intrusions and scoring opportunities.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, he was only able to score three runs in those three innings with one FG.
Goal-front defense in the final stages of the match.
Trailing by four points, the Bills took a penalty at 3rd&9 to become 3rd&14.
18 yards to the finish.
QB Allen at 3rd &14 flowed out of his pocket and to the right, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defense.
He then threw a pass aimed at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone but failed.
On this play, ace WR Stephon Diggs, who was out on the right, ran a charo-cross and was free in front of the end zone, but Allen didn't seem to get in.
On 4th &18, Allen attempted to target WR Gabriel Davis, who ran in from the left outside into the end zone, but the pass was hit by the Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in front of him and failed.
Bryant was one-on-one covering Bills WR Cole Beasley, but he saw Allen's move midway through and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen, who missed the two receivers, threw passes for the end zone in both innings.
The pass on the 4th down may have been a decisive shot, but the 3rd down didn't require a TD.
You just have to get a first down on two plays.
It was only before the two-minute mark, so if it was 4th and short, Allen's ability to run in his own way would have come alive.

It's time to throw it away, and 3 items that are easy to keep in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's Bazaar) - Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably the sponge that you don't replace as often as recommended.
From a 2017 study, it has been found that kitchen sponges multiply a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (but it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
German researchers who did the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
chopping board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that if it starts to wear out, scratches and grooves, the cutting board should be replaced.
This is because once wounds and grooves have progressed, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria multiply.
If you're still okay, don't forget to frequently disinfect a gallon of water with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach solution with a tablespoon.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, drain and dry the water to allow it to dry naturally or lightly tap with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken tableware
Getting rid of your favorite mug can be heartbreaking, but a chipped surface can be a new hotbed of bacteria and bacteria.
It can also cause lips to be cut off at chipped areas or spilling drinks.
Yes, it's your chance to buy your new and favorite mug!

FlashBIOS won't finish helping
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced it with a B550 that I bought in September and a Tomaho
I went to the BIOS setting screen once, but when I saved the settings and rebooted, the white cursor-like dot flashed on the black screen and became accepted all the time
Even if you think that the BIOS is damaged and try to rewrite using the FlashBIOS, it will not end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to end in about 5 minutes, but it does not end even in 1 hour
The possible cause is that the USB memory stick I tried is too old and the guy who converts the SD card and uses it
Are you sleeping too much and getting tomaho done?
Is there any other cause for that?

For some reason I am embarrassed to have a branded product.
If it is inconspicuous, you can have it, but you can not have it written as Lv in the monogram like Vuitton or something.
Why?
I think it is good that it suits my length.
By the way, if it's Japan, I think it's good.
If Japan is the case. Are.
It has nothing to do with the Gaijin style.
You had better say it early, "Why are you calling me that?"
So it doesn't matter because you're a gaijin? It's better to simply say it's uncomfortable.
I don't think I ever dreamed that I would be uncomfortable with a decent probability.
I was living abroad on the way, but Japan people who went outside had a misconception that there were people who came because they didn't like the Confucian customs of up and down, including me, and that it was okay to tell the locals anything because the tag was off.
If you look like a Westerner, you are doing it purely with no ill intent, but with a kind of indulgence or a friendly feeling.
Even my friends in the West call me by their first names Japanese but sometimes when I talk to them, I'm a little confused about which way to go.
Well, if you're a friend, it's still good.
Originally, I guess I was just doing it purely normally, but if I overlook it, I may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment of Gaijin, so I should say it now.

Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because when you do that, you can't be weirdly nasty with younger or older people Japan so you can treat them like people.
Because Japan people are people (myself included) who look at such details regardless of their personality.

Thanks 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this sabré that I just made has exceeded 50 subscribers.
I'm very happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday there were 25 subscribers, so I thought it would take a little longer to get 50 subscribers, but for some reason 25 people subscribed only today, so I am very grateful.
If you subscribed to this Sabré today, I would be grateful if you could tell us in the comments section where you learned about it! (I'm really worried because I don't know)

I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and if it is a small company, I feel that it is a person who is translated well.

Consideration "Demon Blade of Annihilation" training is the battle.
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human hymn< Anime "Yuguo Hen" Launch Commemorative > (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent shonen manga, the one that makes Demon Blade particularly different is that it has a lot of training.
It is a well-established theory that there are no battles for the most part, and that training at dawn and dusk is not popular with readers.
This can be seen from the fact that in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", there was two years of training when the straw clan became separated, but he drew only touches and skipped the rest with gusto.
Well, one of the charms of a dress is the eccentricity of the land you go to, and "staying in the same place and practicing" may not be so compatible.
Now, the training of the protagonist of "Blade of Demon Annihilation", Kajiro, sits on the ground with Tomioka Yoshiyuki, who saved his life, and begs for the life of Zendouko, who tried to take his own life, and says, "Don't let others hold the right to kill and kill!" !" It can be said that it started from what was said by volunteers.
The weak have no rights or choices, they can only be screwed by the strong by force . . .
Having said that, it was the kindness of the volunteer (who is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions) that introduced the "nurturer" Scaletaki Sakinji, who trains the applicants to join the Oni Death Squad.
The first contact between Kajiro and Scales Takiki is when he is asked, "What will you do when your sister eats people?" and he is choked up with an answer, saying that he is "slow to judge" and fires a shot.
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of narratives among fans.
However, carrying around a sister who has become an ogre is fraught with the possibility that there may come a moment when such a judgment will be forced to come.
It can be said that it is an initiation to enter training from a mindset.
However, he takes an amateur Kajiro who has not yet trained to the Narrow Misty Mountain and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is thin in air and full of pitfalls, trebuchets and traps, and I will die before I can go into training.
Still, with his keen sense of smell, he barely manages to sniff out the faint smell of traps set up by human hands and somehow avoid them.
Still, "that doesn't mean I'm suddenly physically strong enough to avoid it all of a sudden!" What makes Kajiro say is the essence that makes demon destruction into demon annihilation.
Normal human beings do not suddenly become strong without any backing, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills that they have honed so far" to their original potential.
"Equal Exchange of Effort," which rewards only those who make efforts and nothing for efforts they have not made, is a different human anthem from demons with baseless paranormal powers, and is an unmovable rule that is consistent in the film.

If you use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will it be frustrating?
Are you frustrated if you work part-time and want to work full-time and work in tandem with other stores?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, it does not fall under what I think is "frustrating".
I think it's "frustrating" to orchestrate something more like this, to somehow get more benefit than effort with minimal effort.
Are there any smoking cessation outpatients across the country that you are doing now?

Samsung Electronics of Korea will establish a new "DX division" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, "Emphasizing user experience" ( WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of the CE and IM divisions into a set division by Samsung Electronics, the company announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) and reflect this in its organizational reorganization at the end of the year.
It can be read that the intention is to strengthen the user experience through various services ranging from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. revealed that the newly established DX division by merging the CE and IM divisions will consist of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networking.
A representative of Samsung Electronics explained, "This name change reflects the medium- to long-term business structure, future-oriented approach, and strengthening of global leadership."
He added that it emphasized the company's commitment to making it easier for consumers to enjoy optimized experiences through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones and telecommunications equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the strategy of transcending organizational boundaries to create synergies on a company-wide scale and building a foundation for differentiated products and services was also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics is already envisioning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through linkage between devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.

It's a bit unnatural here.
The larva of the hanmyō ambushes in the sand so that its prey can be caught at any time, letting only its disc-shaped head peek out of the sand.
I think it should be.
What bothers me is
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at it from an ant perspective?
Is it?
If you translate armoured heads as disk-shaped heads, I think the part that says "on the scale of ants, it is a giant beast wearing a helmet" disappears ...
Aichi 24 cars collision Trailer driver has no chronic illness Carelessness or not (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In the accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the trailer that was arrested and sent to the inspection did not have any chronic illness and seemed to have caused the accident due to some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided with National Route 41 in Komaki City, injuring 12 people lightly.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura, a 54-year-old suspect who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing injury to a 71-year-old man in the first rear-end collision and sent him to the medical examiner on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to move forward without stepping on the brakes after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura did not have any chronic illness and it was found that it was thought to be caused by some kind of carelessness.
Police are raiding the parties involved and investigating the situation in detail at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [ Comics Volume 4 ] ( Weekly Pre-NEWS ) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began in volume 3, will be completed in these four volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted everything from the opening round to the semi-final at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focused on only one match!
- Kinnikuman Volume 4 Review Contributor Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) - Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are a thorough and careful depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that they are by no means volumes that only depict the matches in the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, there are times when the matches are different from before, such as the battle for restraint between the two sides and the scene of special training, but it is not boring at all.
This feeling of the gradual heightening of the tension that the battle of the century is about to begin is definitely connected to the heightened tension of the reader, and even this period is truly a calculated production.
And one more mountain before the important final, not to be overlooked is the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxury of the fight card, I like it because Ramenman shouts to Kinnikuman posters backstage before the game, "Now it's my turn to aim ! 」
and try to slap the chops.
However, the scene where Terryman, who happened to pass by, catches the sword and stops it, stares at each other silently, and the scene is just that they part.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated and there is no more opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there's this kind of anguish over Kinnikuman that Kinnikuman is.
If you can show me something like this, I can't help but think about the activities of the distant future!
This is what it means for a character to stand, and as a manga artist, it is a scene that still makes me keenly aware even now!
The fight between the two ends without much length, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.
Directed at Kinnikuman "Don't rely solely on the strength of God's luck!" 」
That's the line.
This is already a grand meta-statement about the work itself, and I think that readers have felt faintly that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character after all, and that he has somehow won in places where it is not his ability.
But by having Ramenman make this statement, Boiled Egg Sensei took the initiative to stab his nails that he could no longer use his hands.
With these words, the reader may ask, "Oh, so Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin by force?"
How? 」
The uncertain development will stir your imagination again, and from another artist's point of view, this is a line that is almost as if the boiled egg teacher who makes the work imposed a bind on himself.
I thought you did a great job.
I think it's definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held in Aobayama, Takahama-cho (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(Dec. 12) Winter illumination, which began on November 26, is studded with 50,000 LED light bulbs to match the 20-meter-high camphor tree, walking paths, lawns, etc.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time and was surprised that there was such a place.
It's so beautiful and it's a relief."
The illuminations were planned for the first time to give a sense of healing while avoiding the dense, and are lit from 5 to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25.

The Okiga Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities and JA in the Okiga area, conducted PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce" to sell products while distributing videos on the Internet on the 11th.

This morning I was more unhappy...
The NAS PC has stopped powering 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 on.
- What Happened ~
1.) In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is energized.
2.) When I returned to my room after a while, I noticed that the PC was making a sound like a pink rotor, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought that the room temperature drop (6°C) was just making the fan move worse.
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Without booting.
When the power button is pressed, the power light is turned on for a moment, and the fan also moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say yes or no.
I unplug the power plug and try again, but it still works for a moment.
4.) Connect only the motherboard and ATX20 pin, 4 pins and remove the other parts and try but without booting.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause because there has been a buzzing sound that seems to be hitting something in the past and there is a buzzing sound.
Find a surplus ATX power supply at a later date and try it out.
Probably.
If not... What should I do.
