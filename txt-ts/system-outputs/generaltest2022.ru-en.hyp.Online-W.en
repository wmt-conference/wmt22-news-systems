From my point of view, the literature program was shaped by the ladies of the Balzac age based on their interests.
Of 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of balzac age.
And the psychology and torments of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers in general are rarely interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft surface is formed by a plate of natural latex.
Springing block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the effect of "waves" or "hammock.
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to point out the breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, perfectly ventilates naturally, as well as coconut coir.
Thanks to this, it preserves a healthy microclimate of the bed.
The mattress is also covered by an extended warranty period.
The term of manufacturer's official warranty is 5 years, in fact the service life of this mattress is longer.
The removable jacquard shell included in the set protects against dust and dirt.
Purchase a pair of orthopedic pillow to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filling determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

I remember with horror these feasts and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still frying on the stove, and my mother is scrubbing the floor.
God, I was already exhausted when I sat down at the table.
And then he had to wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the party you haul food, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
And what about the guests?
It's good for them, and they must have a cake with them.
Since then I don't like holidays and guests.
Even for my family I set the table on the minimum.
And I cook delicious things for them, bake very often just for fun.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final vaccination, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be sufficient for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be given "in combination with flu vaccination."
This would help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination could help fight the spread of the new Omicron strain of coronavirus.
And the new variant is especially dangerous.
For example, Omicron is three times more likely to be reinfected than Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, the manufacturers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the Omikron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that with two doses of the vaccine, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Infectious Diseases Society, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 wobbler, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, not just backcountry fishing.
These wibs have a higher specific weight than similar in size analogues, which, of course, has a positive effect on the nuances of the application of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature - the upper fin of durable and resilient plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in the vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" in plumb fishing the Bet-A-Vib shows quite an aggressive game.
Often the most catchable is a simple monotonous animation, that is movement of the rod up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is useful when fishing in a confined space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, which can catch.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing for pikeperch and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when you want point and aggressive serving of bait.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with sound capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
Also it was noticed that Bet-A-Vib could irritate passive pike, which don't even react to live bait.
When fishing back cast Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it combines well with fishing line and braided lines even of big diameters.
For fishing back casts of pike, pikeperch, ruffe or perch in addition to uniform is relevant and "step", sometimes with "chirping" on the bottom.
If you catch in a rucked place, you can change the front tee for a double, which reduces the likelihood of snagging.
Among the baits of its class Bet-A-Vib among the most stable in operation and, consequently, one of the most catchable.
With equal success can be used on both relatively shallow and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young loafers are sitting on the necks of old parents.
"Golden youth" are clearly lazy people in most of them, who do not know how to do anything.
A life of plenty disposes them to idleness.

In Libya they claimed about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They have aircraft as well.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya air base (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu agency quotes him.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintaining a presence
According to the interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "has located itself in Libya.
"Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency's publication noted.
Russian authorities have officially denied that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else there may be mercenaries
According to the agency, "Wagner" allegedly operates in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply arms, technology and military services to these countries," the article said.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is listed neither in the law enforcement agencies, nor in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the personnel lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that earlier the postpresidents of the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
Libya's Supreme State Council is a de facto second chamber of the parliament with an advisory function and dominated by Islamists, TASS writes.
The body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting for the election of members of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the material notes.
Against this background, Libya's High Electoral Commission has indefinitely postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy as seen by the Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes are "we defended in Syria, restored peace there," "the decision on Nord Stream-2," "the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons," and "we reclaimed the Crimea."
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become digital only
Dubai government announced a complete move away from paperwork and towards digital technologies.
All public services will also be rendered only electronically.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Dubai - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai's Executive Council, on Saturday.
Internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will now only be done digitally through dedicated IT platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, housing, police, municipalities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of documents began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, authorities have calculated that 336 million pieces of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's auto production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's auto production and exports fell sharply in November amid a depreciating lira.
As a result, the industry's 11-month performance was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to Association, 115 thousand cars were let out from factories in November in Turkey that is 20% less than year before.
About 75.9 thousand cars were sent for export, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
While the first 10 months of the year saw a positive trend in Turkey's auto sector compared to the same period last year, the first 11 months of 2021 saw a 0.3% decline in vehicle production compared to the same period last year.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell in November by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs got credit deferral in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov told about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium businesses, reports the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation and Development of Financial Market, this year in execution of the order of the Head of State from April 1, 2021 adopted the order of the Chairman of the Agency from April 9, 2021 № 127 "On approval of the order of deferral of payments on loans to small and medium business," - wrote in his response to the deputy request Alikhan Smailov.
He reminded that the order of granting deferment of payments on loans implied granting by banks and organizations implementing microfinance activity the deferment of payments on loans granted till April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including private entrepreneurs during the period from April 1 till June 30, 2021.
The term of the deferment ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of SMEs.
In the application of the borrower could have specified a different period of deferral of payments.
During the period of deferment in respect of the borrower were suspended claim and enforcement work, notification of the need for repayment of arrears, as well as collection of commissions and other payments by the lender, "- said the deputy prime minister.
During 2021 the second-tier banks received requests for deferral of payments on loans to 603 borrowers SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received deferral for the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
Applications for deferment were filed to MFIs by 131 SMEs and 95 of them were given delays to the amount of 105,8 mln tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily tolerate the strain of "ocmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those with a strong body defense reaction
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "oxymyron" may be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "oxymyron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, when it mutated, it met no resistance from the immune system.
Due to this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from the immune system, he became very fast.
Apparently, there may be more of these spike proteins than there should be, because their antibodies were not cut down during the mutations," commented pulmonologist Sergei Purjasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune system may tolerate the "ocmiron" more easily than those with a strong defense reaction of the body.
It turns out that a strong body response to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is how it happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people in their 30s die and old people in their 60s sneeze to death.
The immune response is rabid in young people, it is completely inadequate: where you could only wag a finger, it hits like a cannon on a sparrow, - concluded Sergey Purjasev.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case you can often only buy the symptoms - all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat scratch, cough.
Pains on the right or left side, abdominal pains could also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT, noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.

Immunologists hypothesize why obese people fall victim to covid
The authors of the paper studied adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably also capable of doing this.
Biologist talks about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and told about the ways to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
Bad habits like smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle also influence the development of dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and decreased abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its onset," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining adequate levels of exercise, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the department of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the Pirogov Russian State Medical University.
N.I. Pirogov, Head of Cognitive Disorders Department of the Federal Brain and Neurotechnology Center Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
During the last 10 years the Government of Cairo managed to return about 30 thousand artifacts which were illegally taken out of the country.
Shaaban Abdel Gaouad, chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities at the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, said on Saturday, December 11, on air at Al-Hayat TV.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaouad specified that all of the smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Department officials are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, the cultural property is restored and then exhibited in museums.
One of the returned artifacts, he said, was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of an exhibit at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4, at which the bust of more than 3 thousand years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and had not been put up for auction since 1985.
How did the relic get to Europe, is unknown.
Egypt in recent years is actively seeking to repatriate illegally exported from the country at various times monuments of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological investigations of "black diggers.
"Crimean Tatars are not counted" - and this is correct, as the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse wants its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the U.S., the Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a cell phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee has used it to conduct a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote working, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used for business matters.
According to the newspaper, bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not officially commented on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary associations, splintered with Imagism, he is on his own, but known, in demand, at times firmly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
During the year he wrote more than 60 poems, many of them were real masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persian Motives", wrote the poem "Anna Snegina", published 8 books, the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
None of the contemporary poets was awarded such an honor - he was the first!
Besides, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (a factory director, for instance, received 300 rubles a month, an engineer - 200).
The funds in that year were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange a family life, to support his sisters Katya and Sasha and his mother.
It would seem that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice in, but for him everything is painted mostly in dark colors, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain comes from.
Is it the wind that's whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Or like a grove in September,
The alcohol that's been pouring into my brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin strongly deteriorated, did not look good, clearly ill.
Recurrent binges, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism ...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents.
For example, those pertaining to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic outside Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again, he would see him two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is enough evidence of the poet's drinking, of scandals on this basis, of his arrests by the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s the poet's dreadful love affair with the green dragon had been rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly stayed with a friend, the Imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, but Yesenin with his very good income has never had his own place neither in Moscow nor in St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, hotels or with acquaintances.
Startsev recalls:
"He came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
One day, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, scratched his face and wheezed.
Come to himself a little, he coughing incessantly, splashing blood all over the sheet ... ".
Yes, and Yesenin himself after a voyage to Europe and the United States (in the States then was dry law, but Duncan took with him a decent supply of liquor) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there but taverns and streets...
By the end I stopped remembering people...
And I drank, of course...
And I drank because I was bored".

Now my son is almost 16, and he has not been tormented by the urge to pillow for a long time.
All of his energy is focused on choosing what he will do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age, or my husband, who had occasional legal problems until we were married.
A father cares about his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love.
Why did the girl cry at the exam, when she had not yet failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't school.
So she will have a tail.
So what?
She'll retake it.
Millions of students know that.

It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe is ready to further extend restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve.
Minsk responded with a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had earlier decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"The wrong man's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
Velvet jackets dominated social events in 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of "No Time to Die" he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" bowtie.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore an inappropriate green velvet blazer to The Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony and then opted for a more classic version for an event supporting the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah also tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh Ballon d'Or in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons wore the same.
AliExpress is already noticing a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, received by "Gazeta.Ru", they have been bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, navy blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. In this case, men prefer to buy only jackets - Velvet suits sets they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment velvet jackets this season are presented practically in all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is considered Gucci, which brand ambassador Jared Leto wore at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
Choosing the jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interlacing threads a dense fabric with a tufted exterior texture and a smooth interior is obtained.
More budget versions are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but relevance.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It is suitable also for those cases, if in the invitation the dress-code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is specified.
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows making a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of his buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the right advanced hangout with affluence," say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell. - The owners of velvet jackets tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same smart things: classic pants with arrows, solid color shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Things that are too simple and casual will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Handsome Brammell" are sure: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "the head of those who run this event - "yes", for him such a thing in the theme.
If the employee is of a lower rank, but his aim is to move up in a complex company hierarchy or to knock out financial bonuses, it is better to not wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely assess this with the phrase "the wrong man for the wrong hat", - think the editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It is an unnatural timbre, so forcedly drawn.
And it is not associated with a pretty face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is paid for.
Billions of dollars in investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Conventional energy industry is also not in trouble - gas, oil, and coal were all bought cheaper than they sell them now.
Fuel is in wild demand.
A penny drops.
And then who loses out?
The average buyer, as usual.
Do the problems of the Indians concern the sheriff?
So we should not think of Western politicians as idiots who "overslept" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a handsome bribe.
I didn't see a single good-looking person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocre within the average passenger.
Maybe if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, they probably won't get a seat.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "handsome person(s)," but certainly not because of their appearance.

The slave who drools when he smugly describes the charms of the slave life and admires the good and good master is a boor, a boor.
Immunologist says revaccination in four to five months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of coronavirus
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination in six months, given the emergence of the new strain, "a very long period."
"With previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four," the expert said, calling for a revaccination campaign in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has been over-vaccinated and over-vaccinated, or vaccinated and over-vaccinated, then he or she has received 'hybrid immunity,' that is, antibodies are plentiful and neutralizing enough," the expert specified.
"G7" warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the case of an invasion of Ukraine
The "Big Seven" countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement after the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stressed that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have enormous consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document did not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further urged Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding military transparency," as U.S. President Biden said during a Dec. 7 video call to Russian President Putin.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price to pay in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
She said the meeting showed "a united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50 percent of world GDP and have made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective against Omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from the company Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times less effective compared to other types of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris told SCMP.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that the vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the serious course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukrainian Defense Minister accused the FRG of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and anti-drone rifles.
However, it is noted that Berlin later softened its stance on the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek to acquire the aforementioned weapons as part of bilateral agreements with its allies.
In particular, the USA, the UK, Lithuania and France are involved.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply arms under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous FRG leadership explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite Russia's "occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin to equip its navy.
Ukraine expects Germany "to be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that Robert Habek, co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, visited the republic this spring, where he advocated the sale of defensive armaments to Kiev.

The meeting also noted that they condemned the strengthening of the Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," said a statement published on the U.K. government website.
G7 ministers and the EU high representative said they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed escalation and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine."

We have made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).

Ways to get back money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses, if bank card data fall into the hands of hackers, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
A portion of the savings could be put away in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend that you create a separate card for online shopping.
If money was stolen while shopping in stores that do not use the protective technology 3D Secure, you can run a refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service", - clarified the representative of Promsvyazbank.
Artur Zaremba, an expert of the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that customer has the right to apply to the bank to dispute the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online retailers themselves return the money to the client, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19 the member of Public chamber, director of League of safe Internet Ekaterina Mizulina informed that only in 2021 there were 11 thousand appeals on various cases of fraud: from sale of fake documents to stealing of personal data.
According to her, the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine's borders and the situation with Russia's Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to bring Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia may use the pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
For its part, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stem the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a point of contention.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in Wednesday despite Polish and U.S. demands, has made no public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, a position confirmed by G-7 officials on Sunday.

May all be well with them.
It always amazes me when they write about the means to clean the sink, toilet, window sills, faucets.
Do you wash them once a year at Easter, that you have to wash them.
Just don't let them get dirty.
The Ministry of Science and Technologies wants to give writers residencies.
The state will give the future Foundation for the Support of Russian Writers the federal property, inherited from the USSR Union of Writers and the USSR Literary Fund.
The foundation will be converted into writer's residencies, as the Ministry of Digital Economy, which will act as the foundation's founder, told the Parlamentskaya Gazeta newspaper.

The draft decree prescribes to reflect in the charter of the Fund that it "is created in order to promote literary activities by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers.
"The "creation of conditions for creative work" means the creation of writers' residencies in different regions of Russia on the basis of the transferred property, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creative work," the Ministry of Digital explained to our publication.

Doctors warned of the dangers of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccinations
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after the disease COVID-19 and before vaccination for coronavirus.
Irina Yartseva, general practitioner, immunologist, said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 may provoke a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinners are not intended for everyone, only if the patient has been hospitalized, has been in the hospital, and has been diagnosed with complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinning drugs that prevent excessive clot formation) when indicated.
She said that now everyone takes anticoagulants for a long time, and then gets complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (brain hemorrhage).
Sergey Tokarev, chief prophylactologist of the Urals Federal District and scientific leader of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, told URA.RU that Russians often take anticoagulants indiscriminately even before vaccination for coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination by their own decision.
And during the preliminary examination before vaccination doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

Plumber who found money in church wall gets $20,000
The plumber, who found the money in the wall of the church in the U.S. state of Texas, will be paid a reward.
It is reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church Lakewood, where pastor Joel Osteen preaches and promises wealth and prosperity to devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He handed the find over to the church and, he said, didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done,'" KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find appears to be related to a theft that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were stored in the church safe, went missing then.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no loss.
Nevertheless, a $25,000 reward was posted for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Cowley could not qualify for this amount because the reward had already expired.
Despite this, Crime Stoppers of Houston, a nonprofit organization that once gave $5,000 to the award and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in Lakewood Church's wall.
Tanya, her statements, her actions are what characterize her "as a real person."
That's why her attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially richer than all the scribes," as they write here.
There are people richer, but not all behave so brazenly, so defiantly, as this madam.

New case of human infection with bird flu virus detected in China
A new case of human infection with the avian influenza virus of the highly pathogenic H5N6 variety has been detected in China.
This was reported by RTHK radio station with reference to the notification of the health authorities in Hong Kong, TASS reported.
The infection has infected a 68-year-old resident of the Huizhou urban district in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry.
His condition has been assessed by medics as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in southwestern Sichuan province.

Brazil has made it compulsory for citizens to show vaccination passports when entering the country
Brazil has compelled to require vaccination passports for those entering the territory of the state, a decision was made by a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luiz Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens with contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting the certificate of vaccination.
Also on the list of exemptions are those arriving from countries where there is a proven lack of vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which suggests an increase in tourist traffic," Barroso noted.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities obliged tourists unvaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection scheme against COVID-19 has been disclosed
Dr. Anatoly Altstein, virologist, Merited Scientist of Russia, told Ura.ru about the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and applying a nasal vaccine.
In nasal administration, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are formed. This does not happen with the injection of the vaccine.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucosa, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside after the vaccination we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) produced.
And if you give both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet," said the doctor.
Sergey Tokarev, Chief Prophylactologist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences, in his turn, stated that the main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection vaccination is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help that in this case the protection of the body should presumably become maximal.
Earlier the Minister of Public Health of Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseinov stated that spread of new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the pattern observed in other countries, where the next pandemic wave came earlier.
Inna, hmmm.
I had this conversation with my male dog (died long ago) - if you're ready to trade a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a heifer bitch, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and clever in general.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works 90% of the time.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I have slowed down many owners not to run after the dog, even though they wailed that over there, 200 thousand run away (pomski), just took my hand and led him in the other direction.
In the end, the "200,000" chose the owner over the dog that was running somewhere out there.
Mass protests by vaccination opponents continue unabated in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
Starting next February, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spanish people, outraged by the authorities' health policies, marched peacefully in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated.
A large protest against the health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce health passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then developed into clashes with the policemen.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the policemen.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., there is not even a consensus on this, even on Wikipedia.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also labeled as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
There is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: Americans have brought only death and plunder to any country wherever they have appeared.

WHO has already detected omicron in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that a new strain of the coronavirus Omicron has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
As of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to spread actively only since late November.
WHO also expresses its concern over the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may outpace the "delta" strain, also the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely all countries without exception.
Previously, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, said that the Omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of ill people only in Britain will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "omikron" at the moment in the Kingdom a few hundred people are sick, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at its peak more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospital daily.
This is something the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times less effective than the rest of the disease.
How Russia's Sputnik V responds to Omicron is not yet known - that will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Or with your hands on your waist?

And again they call the Soviet period "the time of demons.
Back then people believed in God more honestly than today.
And were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for neighbor, do not steal, etc.).

Chatterers like Globa have little faith (and none at all), but even so, the time of demons came in the 90's...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad commune with Bolshaya Zelenina keeps in touch until now.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of the relationship between the older generation.
This may be due to the fact that there were no newcomers in the apartment, we did not rent rooms, and nobody cancelled the brotherhood of the siege.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.

The Russians were warned about a new fraud scheme
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by the "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the director on products of company Ivideon Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger, which is connected with spreading of video communications, is dipfakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video on the basis of real records involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network can accurately reproduce the features of the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using dipfake, attackers can call friends of the victim via video call or create a video with a copy of the person to send out for blackmail.
"Such spoofs can easily provoke bullying because a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
For his part, Varonis leading systems engineer Alexander Vetkol noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technology using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, my emphasis was that I was buying all of this in a small town where the local mentality didn't allow for much makeup and walking around in short skirts and showing stockings and tights on your legs.
This is the province, but there were such goods in the store.
In large cities, Muslim women also wore makeup and showed their thighs.
This was also the case in Dushanbe, which is a large city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of fashionable women, but the same cosmetics are not available.
Here are five steps to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some people don't attach much importance to it, and for good reason.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of the disease.
For example, doctors recommend changing your drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on your metabolism.
Sugary foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excessive quantities.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
Not only improper diet, but also habits influence the appearance of the disease.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
Eating plenty of fiber is necessary to protect against diabetes.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to a feeling of fullness, the release of digestive juices and increased digestion.

Dr. Pavlova told about "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to worsening of health at the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of health after working weekdays is often a "weekend migraine", said well-known physician-endocrinologist, Ph.D., a senior fellow of the Department of Basic Medicine of Moscow State University, the scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in his Telegram-channel.
According to her, workaholics are particularly often affected, with headaches, brokenness and weakness at the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to accumulated fatigue during the week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
During the weekend our lives change drastically.
"We sleep a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - The lack of coffee causes a little withdrawal.
Overeating and lack of water make you feel heavy and broken."
Late rising plays an additional role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you have a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of health, Pavlova recommended to trace what changes the most during the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa said the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine against omicron is low
South Africa says low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It was estimated that it (Omicron neutralization rate) corresponds to a (level of) vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which makes the... questioned the vaccine's ability to protect against infection," said the text of the study published on MedRxiv.

How much hidden sugar is in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product there may be hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names may appear on the label, essentially denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There can also be other torn sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As Roskachestvo states, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste different, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, because you have to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be much higher than what is listed on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will no longer be important for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports would lose importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonizing the economy.
He said Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to having Ukraine transport Russian natural gas in the future, as the resource is essential to the energy transition at this time.
He recalled that Germany and the USA made a statement recording Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream - 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement it was stated that the European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked Twitter of Indian Prime Minister
Hackers broke into Twitter-account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced at noon on Sunday, December 12, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
However, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results released by the local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of New Caledonians voted for independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
Turnout was 43.90%, with a total of more than 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the election.
As France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of this election left no room for doubt", since supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on December 12, arguing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 in the archipelago prevented a full and "fair" campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, following referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence; in 2020, 53.3% voted against it.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
According to the Elysee Palace on Sunday, December 12, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence has largely animated the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have argued in favor of keeping the territory within France because it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valérie Pécresse, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of Caledonians be the choice of France."

Bread, butter, pink salmon.

Earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is marked that epicenter of this earthquake was located 231.8 km to the North-East from Severo-Kurilsk town.
Origin was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists registered the earthquake with magnitude 7.5 in Peru, which affected ten people.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory will begin to create unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as ANKA.
This was announced on December 11 by Alexey Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," Dialogue.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, Arestovich says that we are talking about the jet, not piston-driven UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA drone was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been conducted by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a factory to produce modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement to build a center in the Kiev region, which will train personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from an airport container
Two lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
It is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container of seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions laid down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from it because of the protective netting installed next to it.
The standoff ended when Mandai Wildlife Group, the zookeepers of Singapore, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its master and roamed the streets of the city.
The animal voluntarily returned home the same day and no humans were harmed.
Experts warn of cancer threat from vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, in contrast, exceeding the required dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama at Birmingham nutritionist professor Beth Kitchin advises keeping track of the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure up or down.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 pills without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to watch the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men after age 50 eat the fruit more often.
About 75,000 people in the UK could die by April because of the Omicron strain
According to forecasts by British scientists, up to 75.000 people may die in the next five months in England due to the spread of omicron strain of coronavirus unless restrictive measures are tightened during winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to the study of experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergency situations to the British Cabinet, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25 thousand deaths due to omikron strain, and all hospitalized will be about 175 thousand patients.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will admit more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious coronavirus control measures may be needed to keep the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain proves more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines cannot rule out infection," said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
Earlier, the U.K. Health Safety Agency informed: if the rate of spread of the omicron strain continues at its current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
Moreover, the Omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom as early as mid-December.
At the moment in the United Kingdom there are 1898 cases of infection with omicron strain of coronavirus, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
In this case, December 9 head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid pointed out that in reality the figure may already reach 10 thousand cases.

The demand for superyachts in the world has grown by a quarter
This year's superyacht construction and next year's orders are breaking all records around the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world's registry of ships was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and money for a floating fortress for £50 million or more will not be decreasing, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year 25% more vessels have been ordered than the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a rush on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contagion on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic aboard their own vessel.
The second reason also has to do with the coronavirus.
While all of these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely and negotiate by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
That means customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying their own planes irritates society because the elite don't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and suggest new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, though they realize that with so much mobility of money, this will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-meter-long yacht REV Ocean.
When launched it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht features a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed to explore the sea depths.
On existing superyachts, helicopter pads, open-air movie theaters, and some, such as wrestler McGregor's yacht, a martial arts platform have become common.Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University of America, says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic value when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
And two-thirds of the emission footprint came from his 162.5-meter-long yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not aboard the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and command to bring the yacht from, for example, the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean Sea.
Superyacht owners have no sympathy for others when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It's also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters in diameter.
Dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to colon cancer identified
American scientists have determined the volume of alcoholic beverages in a week increases the risk of developing cancer.
It is written about it by the Daily Express edition.
Specialists have come to the conclusion that the use of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages a week is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
Moreover, the likelihood of developing cancer increases with increasing the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of colon cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

It would seem that almost all girls dream of being princesses in beautiful puffy dresses, and I was no exception.
But looking at such a dress, I changed my mind about being a princess.
Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two year old.
Many, or rather all dog lovers believe that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not realize how advanced the four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how the intelligence of animals is developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' findings were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, and they know nothing about politics, economics or art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Some breeds, according to experts, show better results in understanding the words of human language, but statistical data for exact conclusions is still not enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - Labradors, for example.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and on the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepared for US-Russia bargaining
The U.S. and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine joining NATO, analyst Aleksandr Kochetkov said in his article for the Glavred edition.
In his opinion, in the near future, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite US leader Joe Biden's words on the right of countries "to join anything.
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but just send the offerer away.
And with regard to Ukraine there will be bargaining," - wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are being made covertly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the grouping to be discovered and counterforce deployed," he said.
China encourages development of rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021 in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allows trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said the company's representative Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which went into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed.
In May this year, the first China-developed double-decker high-speed electric trains for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railroads of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, trial operation of the subway train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will run on the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
This subway line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest subway line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's rail transport equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for International Trade Promotion /CCITF/.
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment manufacturing in the world market," Feng Yaoxian said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a full range of support facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in electrification of railroads and in operating mileage on high-speed and urban railroads.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin in a conversation with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments such as inability to concentrate, planning, decreased level of abstract thinking.
There is an ongoing debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, physicians do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help to reduce the risk of dementia.
Also WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly train cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still debated in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, a dementia research charity in Britain said the disease increasingly affects people in their 40s.
Medics named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient becomes difficult to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze told journalists. He is a member of consultative committee of doctors set up at Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading to his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and character variability," the specialist said, noting that this is not outside the normative limits and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurorehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging his medical treatment after prison officials disciplined him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to have the punishment lifted and regained his former rights.

We feed all the alcoholics, drug addicts, who also lost their health due to their stupidity.
Then we are surprised at the extension of the retirement age.
These sums could have been spent on treating the really sick.

There were protests against COVID passports in Spain
The Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia held protests against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports Europa Press agency.
In the Catalan capital the number of protesters was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became compulsory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment establishments.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their banners, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for the respect of citizens' choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in that city declared a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified in Spain since the start of the pandemic, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The bills on a unified system of QR codes have been submitted to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to attend public events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities and retail trade with a certificate of vaccination or a disease suffered, or a waiver of vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and air.

Steep ascent: how the Chinese become skiers.
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international standards in the country.
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will make it possible to collect the 1 trillion yuan marked by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also underway: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
Many regions in China where the resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, have problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to ensure that the Chinese resorts are comfortable and interesting, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Games advisor Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in the winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the infrastructure needed for recreation has yet to be built there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, not far from where the Winter Olympics will be held.
He notes that winter sports tourism has boomed here in recent years.
Two years ago there was an express railroad line from Beijing to Chunli, and now none of the locals are out of work.
More and more stores selling winter sports apparel and equipment are opening in the country.
Catering outlets with national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
There is even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwu now.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes to become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment to reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people around the world could be pushed into extreme poverty because of a coronavirus pandemic that has stalled human progress toward universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and the WB published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic had led to breakdowns in health services and overstretched health systems.
Consequently, immunization coverage declined for the first time in 10 years and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria rose.
The WHO and the WB stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became harder for people to pay for treatment.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets.
In October, UN Secretary General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people with little or no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan minister cut off from broadcast at Summit for Democracy at White House request
Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" has been put into a video-free mode, a YouTube recording of the summit shows.
Reuters quoted sources as saying that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map that showed Taiwan in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tang was showing was produced by CIVICUS, a South African nongovernmental organization, and ranked the countries of the world according to their civil rights record.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free," while China, the DPRK, Laos and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed.
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the panelists' views "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have gone against Washington's "one China" policy.
One source said the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department after the map display, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy", organized by Washington, was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During Day Zero of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitriy Muratov called for the creation of an international foundation that would donate the money obtained from corruption to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yury Averyanov stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese message.
You are being fed information as if they are cooking food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the meat is left to the butcher until the last bite.

That is why the environmental fairy tale was invented for suckers, who will also work hard to collect garbage for free for an idea.
Personally, my contribution to environmentalism is not buying unnecessary things and using things for a long time.
If I go overboard, I don't throw it away, I give it to charity.

SKETCHES OF A RURAL MUSCOVITE.
Don't lump it together - bad people happen, you may have a beef with them about a particular thing...
but what does it have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, and so on?
You write that they are "scumbags, didn't give the money back."
And how many and when they have children is none of your business, as long as they are not going to hang those children around your neck.
And since that's out of the question, what right do you have to judge them?
I guess it's only in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, blatantly ignoring the existing ones.
What if this were to apply to other areas of life, the judiciary, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
And if my dad still implements its methods of education and upbringing?
It's creepy and a very bad example for others to follow.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told about the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States
In the interview for Izvestia, Sergey Ryabkov, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia evaluated the perspectives of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction has led to sad conclusions and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but when it comes to some kind of prospect for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we've been on with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the U.S. desire to impose approaches on Russia on a host of issues.
Ryabkov added that he wouldn't risk giving optimistic forecasts about the improvement of relations and didn't expect Washington's position to change.
He explained that except for such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, no progress has been seen.
Meanwhile, Russia urges the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned of the dangers of nasal COVID vaccination outside hospitals
People inoculated with nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may develop allergies and require medical assistance, therefore the first stations for vaccination should not be organized at airports and trade centers.
Sergei Netesov, a virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University, told TASS.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centers, but I would do it only in medical institutions at first.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is not high, but it is advisable for a person to sit next to a doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special anti-allergy drug kits which are effective in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in trade centers when there is experience in using the drug.
He also stressed that when using nasal vaccine it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person blows his nose after being injected while nasal congestion is present.

Lama, they say true believers make up the church.
Whether these true believers exist or not, we cannot know.
Every one of us would like to be such a true believer, and everyone tries to be one.
But no one should say, either about himself or about those who believe as he does, that they alone are true believers.
Because if they can say of themselves that they are true believers, so can others.

Alexander M., Can you remind me which style of marathon was used at the 2021 World Cup?
Do you see the track, which should be used to finish the race in classic style?
Attention, question - what is Clebo doing on the right side of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the track if he was on the back side before the turn?
And "the best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, in fact, I wasn't even a driver yet.
I had a license, but I didn't know how to drive.
I was offered to drive 250km one way on a MAZ!
Young, stupid, I agreed.
The owner was beside me, sipping vodka, I was driving.
First, like a king, I took the axle!
A column lined up behind me.
I let him through.
Then the belt on the steering blew.
Then the cops stopped us.
We were in an organized convoy, and their car broke down.
We had to have it towed.
The MAZ owner explained that he was drunk, the driver was inexperienced.
And he said, "What kind of drunk are you?
You're not stumbling, you're not falling down.
Ahead of us with blinkers and go!
In my opinion, he never gets out of commercials, he can't be sorry.

The UK has detected 1,239 cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus in a 24-hour period - RT in Russian
In the UK overnight detected 1,239 cases of infection with the new Omicron coronavirus strain.
About this informs Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were detected in England, 38 people became ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people sickened by COVID-19 from the new strain in Britain has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine calculated in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England by April because of an outbreak of coronavirus caused by the omicron strain.
Peskov warned of suffering for Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions if "aggressive actions" against Ukraine continue, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on Russia 1 television channel.
Peskov said that "everyone in the world understands this.
Earlier, it was reported that the U.S. is considering imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars with regard to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
However, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is sure that this is impossible.
From adequate thinking people - respectively adequate comments!
Something about these simple recipes makes me sick to my stomach.
Apparently, we have run out of ideas.
Even in the distant days of childhood my mother baked delicious cakes and pies, and did not come to mind a piece of bread, smeared with jam, compare with a cake.
Xenia, you don't need to convey anything to my mind, my mind has to figure it out for itself!
"The inability of the mind separated from Spirit to perceive" - what do you mean?!
Suppose you had to explain it to a dumb child, how would you do it?
(Keep in mind that a 3-5 year old child still has open channels of communication with the netherworld, and that child may know more than you do!)
Residents of New Caledonia have rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French channel BFM.TV.
Against independence opposed 96.5% of voters.
3.51% of the residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results were annulled by 2.99% of ballots.
The level of participation in the voting that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by separatists' calls to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians opposed independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region already held a referendum on independence.
The majority of residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago and the territory enjoys a special administrative-territorial status.
There's an agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia in 1998 under which the region could vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO tentatively considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively considers "omicron" less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of reduced vaccine efficacy for the new COVID-19 variant.
As of Dec. 9, Omicron has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the "omicron" strain suggest a decrease in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ('disease severity' - ed.) may be less severe than for delta," the WHO technical report says.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been reported in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova said there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

They named four scenarios for Zelensky in Ukraine
Former Ukrainian MP Vadym Denisenko listed four scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and also, perhaps, will compromise on Donbass.
Denisenko said this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the portal "Glavred."
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine by reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development would contribute to a deep crisis, which Kiev could face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation of the authorities with the key FIGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)," the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denysenko, there is also another scenario for the development of the situation - "a war against everyone".
This prediction will come true in case of high turbulence in the world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation inside the country is possible.
At the end of the summer Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of the population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, due to which the seizure of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives" is likely.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will start "reformatting the government," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is Zelensky's transformation into the "father of the nation."
Some kind of event could lead to this, which would be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the former deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly denied any probability of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that were increasing military activity near Russia's borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a poll conducted by the Rating sociological group showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3 percent.
This is the lowest figure since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the next presidential election in Ukraine only 21.8% would give their vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% for the former president, Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of the respondents expressed their support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova is dead, it is very sad to hear about it.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Seoul Olympics, for us, the people of Primorsky Region, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such emotions were running high, I remember the joy when Yelena won.
I also remember the joy of the other victories, how we were rooting for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes of that time.
Once on TV I saw a documentary about a Central American country, and there watermelons were rolled up the gangway aboard the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself worked many times in my youth harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never encountered watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the melon field and not before the beginning of August.

The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the neckline and under the breasts.

Really didn't like the article, angry, toxic.

Arrested for the action in Red Square poet: "You get ten days in jail for quoting Yevtushenko, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week for ten days arrested 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov.
The HSE student was detained on Red Square with a placard bearing the hashtag #poetstheRussiaBolshechempoet.
This quote belongs to writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A report was drawn up on Alexander under the administrative article on repeated violation of the order of holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the culture of common in Russia and as a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We got in touch with the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How were you treated by the police during your arrest this time and earlier?
What did they ask you at the station, how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in some context of the word.
At Pushkinskaya Street, they were taken by OMON riot police, and they were brutal.
They asked the standard questions - about their motives.
When they heard them, in principle, they looked understanding, if not approving.
Except for the monkey-chamber, which was blown through to all four corners, everything was extremely accurate, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if a few people start writing poetry under that hashtag after the rally, I won't spend those 10 days in jail for nothing.
Maxim, according to the protocol, you may speak the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe in private.
But at public and official events, you speak in the language of your surroundings, so that everybody understands what happened in Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in your native language through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and still uses an interpreter.
And also at official events, transcripts are taken the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and a stenographer doesn't have to know several languages.

Researchers tell how potatoes help fight age-related disorders
A study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve circulation and lower cholesterol.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the body systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Because of their high content of cellulose, they are good for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption, they can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefits, the root vegetable is better braised or boiled rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as can other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods containing carbohydrates that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production on private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market players, the product shortage at the moment can only be replaced with imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from "Yandex
Candidates for removal
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the top 100 pirate sites on Runet and most of them have ceased to exist, said Karen Kazarian, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in both Yandex and Google search results, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, it is a so-called screen version (a pirated copy of the film shot in a theater).

"This idea, developed by Poles" - it would be more correct to say that Poland only recycled the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "The outskirts are not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, doesn't really change the point.

Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropacket".

Fillings: the top and bottom of the springs are installed combinations of coir and natural latex layers.

While the coir provides proper support for the back, the latex ensures the adaptation of the surface to the human body.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported Sunday.
The purpose of the missions starting in five years is to assess the livability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
So far it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-type planet.
On the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Assuming that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar or different to Earth.
If very similar, it would be obvious that terrestrial life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it is more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaworlds will change Russian business
The topic of meta-universes became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the major player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as all over the world, will invest in creating their own metaclasses and their subsequent monetization.
Metavalleys should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, it is a trend to create remote interactions under pandemic conditions, because people are tired of disconnection and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models for them.
On the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, where any rights, securities, works of art and even money are going digital.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start to eat right, you no longer want something too fatty and unhealthy.
Of course, on holidays, we will have the traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat, but no one is forcing me to stuff myself with everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it, and then that's enough.
After all, there are ten days off in front of me, and I can make any delicious and healthy meal.

And anyone who hasn't just played the sport or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, DON'T GET THEY CARE.
British economist couldn't give a prediction for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts would turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change the turnaround.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, with inflation in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he doesn't know if the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless central bank generosity had run its course" and it was time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates would correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of a pandemic, continued ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to another spike in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, concluded O'Neill.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of global research at Otkritie Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, with less significant growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, oil price dynamics and worries about the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is good: if you compare yourself to myself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
There is progress, but it is sluggish.
There is also such a problem: there are a lot of environmental initiatives in the cities, but people do not know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxis that pick up waste from the house.
The banal recycling center is used by the marginalized.
Rarely do people bring glass and metal there.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of GDP
At the end of 10 months of 2021 Russians spent on buying new cars 2 trillion 784 billion rubles, which is 28% more than during the same period last year, according to statistics from Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic coronavirus.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount was comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leader in the Russian market in terms of revenues.
During 10 months of this year it managed to sell cars for 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24% more than the year before.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai has had an even more significant increase of over 35%, and its proceeds from car sales are estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
The brand is also the leader in weighted average price increase of the car - for the year in Hyundai it has grown by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of price increase was only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands have grown not so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms Kia sold over the same period 9.4% more cars than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost by 12 %.
Japanese Toyota is third in sales volume in money terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles for cars of this brand within 10 months, which is 14% more than a year before.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased its sales volume (37%) and weighted average car price (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has a good growth in sales and weighted average price at the same time - more, for example, than BMW - hence a greater growth in financial capacity," explained the general director of NAPI Tatiana Arabadji. -
The Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year, are demonstrating fantastic sales growth rates.
Russian Lada shows the average market performance in terms of sales growth dynamics (plus 28%), for cars of this brand Russians spent over 10 months 229.4 billion rubles.
In terms of financial capacity, the companies whose car sales dropped in 2021 are at last year's level: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan, among others.
UAZ is even in the red - in 10 months Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of that brand against 12.4 billion rubles the year before.
Against the background of problems with automotive component supplies and production stoppages affecting the entire global auto industry, auto companies are continuously adjusting prices - AvtoVAZ raised the price of Lada models 7 times a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) happened at the end of November.
Other automakers are also rewriting the prices of their products on a regular basis.
The volume of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will keep growing - apart from the lack of cars, inflation and the desire of automakers to win back the previous losses are also contributing to it, according to experts.
In conditions of a deficit of cars, I think that many automakers even managed to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not lay in the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, auto industry analyst at VTB Capital. -
I believe that, financially, automakers are feeling very well now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of cars cost, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantity and in money terms, but mainly due to inflation and complications in the design of the cars themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As the supply grows, the opportunities for the price increase will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, the automakers will be able to get their income from the volumes, says Sergei Burgazliev, an independent consultant on the automobile industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are striving to get the highest profit from each car sold, said Burgazliev. -
The increase in car production is not expected for at least half a year, and in Russia the agitation is further fueled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation cars turned out to be a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original value, the expert stated.
Biden speaks out about deployment of the US military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in case of Russia's "invasion".
U.S. President Joe Biden made this statement.
"There have never been any such plans," the White House head said, responding to a reporter's question about whether the U.S. had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
He stressed that the USA and NATO had no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The US leader also said that the possibility of using US troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. would redeploy forces to eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in Kiev's military use of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "U.S. weapons are approaching our territory.

If a fraudster, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, calls from such a number, it's ineffective to reset immediately, and it's probably not enough time to blacklist them.
Because to confirm his lie about being involved with the security forces, he quickly repeats the call and continues to intimidate and coax.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
This is such nonsense...
I don't believe it was like that at all.
They don't know what to think of anymore, who to blame.
They got to the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except the very, very best...
Wouldn't it be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus would disappear...
Like in Japan... they loosened up before the election and there were fewer infections...

As the regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, out of touch.
Just yesterday the president of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KAMAZ enterprise.
