When I tried to buy the entry package, the blue and orange packages came out.
The price is more than doubled for the orange one.
What's the difference?
I didn't know when I looked it up, so please tell me
Right now, there should only be blue ones.
If there is one, it may just be that the old product remains.
Both are the same, just because they look different.
Karate vs. jiu-jitsu
If you fight with the same height or weight, which one is stronger?
Jiu Jitsu
In general karate, I only practice karate fighting with each other
This is because jiu-jitsu, especially Brazilian jiu-jitsu, is practiced including dealing with blows.

I don't feel like watching TV anymore because there's such a thing...
Heck does it mean that entertainers have become impossible? There are only entertainers on TV.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there are quite a few scenes where the staff laughs in the back even when they say things that are not particularly interesting.
Obviously it's not an interesting place, but it's creepy to laugh at everything I say because I'm a selling entertainer.”
But if the staff don't laugh, the entertainers will lose their mood, and they will probably be bad in terms of work relationships.
Like the old black companies, that industry is really like an athletic meet, and it seems that the egos of some entertainers are so huge that they usually take a disgusting attitude, and if you don't do that, you won't be able to eat it.
On the other hand, there are a lot of theories about “don't lick entertainers” one by one because the entertainers themselves feel that their work is difficult.
I know that income is quite low until it starts to sell, but even if people say that entertainers stand at the top of the top job categories where their jobs are difficult.
I can only hear it as a justification for the beautification of my own career and the fact that comedians have too high a position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is also quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the entertainer world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry I complained about it.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't go outside like farts...

I was able to replace the product I ordered at Tsukumonet Shop without permission
Summary: When I ordered a wireless mouse that was cheap, I received a wired version of the mouse, and I was told to return it if I wanted a refund
It's a mail order trouble rather than a topic of self-made PCs, but no matter how you think about it, I'm not convinced and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here
It started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mice were sold for 3,280 yen (linked Gyotaku) at the Tsukumo Day sale of Tsukumo Net Shop that started the previous Friday
The wired version was the same price at the store, so when I checked the page of the wired version considering the possibility of a price mistake, it was 5,071 yen (linked Gyotaku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake
I received an order email normally, and I also received a next-day shipping email
The name of “CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEALESS WIRELESS” was written in these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page
Since there were no mistakes or cancellation notices from order to shipment, I thought at this point that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive
The problem started here, and an email came a few hours after shipment saying “there was a mistake in registering the product”
According to that email
* The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually a wired version
* Since we have already shipped a wired mouse,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return only the mouse for a refund
3. Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose the correspondence of
The product pages of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and even though the wireless version is written in the purchase history, email, and delivery slip, it seems that the wired version was replaced without permission and sent
Isn't it terrible that something different from the product I bought was sent without understanding it, and if I want a refund, I should return it from here?
I want to do a one-shot counterattack even if I accept a refund in the end, so please lend me some wisdom

The reason why we are not on good terms is that there are people with various personalities and unreasonable people, whether they are parents or siblings.

Isolated twice... The only bridge leading to the district due to typhoon and heavy rain flows out Residents triple stockpiled food ＜Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture＞ (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! news
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Kouchihara district of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
It was the East Japan Typhoon in 2019 that had a big impact on the lives of 8 people in 3 households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: “At first, it feels like 'seriously? '
I felt like it would break so unexpectedly or that it would be washed away.” The only road leading to the Kouchihara district, “Kouchihara Bridge,” was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, and 30 people from 11 households in the district were isolated .
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry necessary supplies using JR iron bridges, which are not usually allowed to pass.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: “Normally, cars can come to the garden, but when you get out of the car over there, you can hold it in your hand or carry it on your back and walk over the iron bridge to come here, so I felt grateful for the means of transportation and cars.” 1 The emergency bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for a few days until a temporary bridge was built.
About two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: “I think there are about 10 cases.
For now, I thought I would like to somehow secure 2-3 days worth.” Foods that can also be used for emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, are prepared about three times as much as before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: “I don't know when a disaster will fall on me, not someone else's affairs, so I felt once again that it would be better for everyone to do a little stockpiling or something.” On the other hand, the bridge is washed away “unexpected The town of Yamatsuri experienced a “disaster”.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town's own initiatives began in 2021.
Yamatsuri Town Education Division/Takahashi Ryuichi Section Chief: “We have also made an announcement that we will set it in the form of 'Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and that October 12 will be a day to think about disaster prevention preparedness even after next year.
I think awareness of the possibility of unexpected things happening has increased more than ever before.”
Article at the time of purchase
The test itself is almost over, so all you have to do is write a sentence, but we are also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is wrong for the time being, so please wait a bit.

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
What are the pitfalls of the “Building Status Survey System” (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! news
● The newly established “Building Status Survey” system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Second-hand housing transactions are doing well.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums have risen, and the remodeling market is also on an expanding trend.
While homeownership intentions are increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, popularity is concentrated on properties represented by words such as “in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station,” “large scale,” and “tower,” which are soaring, and the drastic decline in relatively cheap newly built properties has also affected It's probably there.
[See the images in this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Ministry of Land, Transport and Tourism) partially revised the Residential Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Law, and started a building status survey for the purpose of safe and secure second-hand housing transactions, so-called inspections ( https:/www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf)
This is a system in which an architect familiar with housing checks the current situation and the condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and presents it to the buyer after summarizing it in a report.
The Ministry of Land, Transport and Tourism explains that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers due to the introduction of inspection.
This is because sellers can avoid complaints after delivery by conducting property surveys before sales transactions, and buyers are given a sense of security.
In turn, it is said that it will also lead to differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, he explains that it is a system that allows buyers to grasp the status of second-hand houses they plan to purchase and purchase them with satisfaction, and at first glance it is a system that has great merit.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller side that has the initiative to investigate the status of buildings.
In addition, I would like to note that only the notification of the system called inspection became mandatory.
In other words, the real estate operator in charge of brokerage is obliged to explain that “I can introduce an architect who conducts a building status survey when brokerage a property” or “I can't do it”, but the implementation itself is not mandatory It comes down to that.
● Risks of concern due to seller-led inspections On the other hand, if you turn your eyes overseas, similar systems are already in place in the United States, the United Kingdom, etc., where the second-hand market is booming.
It is a system in which buyers ask experts called “inspectors” or “building surveyors” to conduct building surveys at the preliminary stage of buying and selling houses.
For example, in the case of the United States, inspections are carried out on 70-90% of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
In that the inspection is carried out by the “buyer” to the last, the Japanese-style inspection, which is the main “seller”, and its nature are very different.
The seller shows the condition of the building even a little better and tries to sell it as high as possible and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer side wants to examine the contents of the investigation, make appropriate repairs, and live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap between the purposes and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern about the Japanese system.
● The scope of seller-led inspections determined by the government is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking a really important defect ● For inspection companies, the brokerage company (seller) that introduces the case in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that “serious” inspections will be carried out, such as not reporting unfavorable investigation results to the seller

It was pretty tough.
However, is it mentally healed (?) That's why I was full of motivation.
I fell asleep while I was at work because my body didn't follow me and I was in a research position.
When it was the second time of the year, it was also the second time, so if I thought lightly about I'm going to take a break for about a month and say goodbye to the damn garbage company, it was more severe than I thought and the medicine didn't fit, and it lasted a long time with the feeling that I wanted to see it.
Anyway, it's important to go to a psychiatrist and have them deal with it correctly, and to leave a history of hospital visits (super important)
If you have a history of going to the hospital, even if you leave the company for your own convenience, you can change to corporate retirement at the doctor's discretion on Halloween, so the hurdles for receiving unemployment insurance etc. will drop drastically

Was Ginza an island?
5 Trivia Selections You Can Talk About While Using a Silver Bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! news
“This used to be a peninsula.
It is also unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia like “proof of that...”
Here are some trivia facts about Ginza that are interesting to know and that you will surely want to tell someone about.
I'm going above Ginza! ?
Sneak into the gold seat for the first time
As you walk through Ginza, traces of the history that the land of Ginza has carved, such as quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and many shrines, remain everywhere.
I was walking around Ginza with her, and the silence that came unexpectedly said, “This used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
“Ginza” in Tokyo's Chuo Ward is synonymous with the downtown area that created “XX Ginza” all over Japan.
In the first place, “Ginza” is a silver coin foundry, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called “Shinryogae-cho,” but when it moved to Kakigara-cho, it came to be commonly called “Ginza.”
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a “peninsula” protruding into the sea.
Until before the Edo period, a cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called “Edomae Island” stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to what is now Ginza.
When Ieyasu TOKUGAWA opened the bakufu in Edo, he reclaimed the cove and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi district.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed city blocks and went around moat wari in order to develop boat transportation.
Then, the soil from which the moat was cut down and Mt. Kanda was cut down, and the cove was reclaimed.
In front of the Tiffany's Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of “the birthplace of Ginza” indicating the site of the Ginza government office, so why not look for people you are interested in.
Ginza's “pilgrimage to sacred places” known to those in the know
Every year in Ginza, there is a “pilgrimage to sacred places” known to those in the know called the “Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour”.
Of the more than 10 sacred places, the most visible is probably the “Kabuki Inari Shrine” in front of the Kabukiza Theater.
At the shrine that stands at the far right of the Kabukiza Theater, there are many people who pray before and after watching the theater.
Meanwhile, “Ryuko Fudoson Temple” is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and “Ginza Shusse Jizo” is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
“Hodo Inari Shrine,” “Azuma Inari Shrine,” and “Toyoiwa Inari Shrine” are located in the back of the alley and are difficult to stand out, but “Toyoiwa Inari Shrine” is known for being revered by famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon, and the Shiseido Ginza Building The “Success Inari Shrine” at the 1F entrance is closed to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
There are places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined in this shrine tour, but most shrines enshrine Inari as their deity.
“Inari-sha,” where foxes greet you in front of the main building, was built in a popular place where there are many farmers, to benefit from a “good harvest of five grains,” where rice grows well.
That changed, and in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it came to be said that there was a benefit of prosperous business, and faith spread even in Ginza, the busiest downtown area in Japan.
What do you think of people who return home without getting the vaccine?

From 2 days ago, my front teeth were painful and I went to the dental clinic because there was a pain like hyperesthesia when I pressed or touched it.
My nerves have been pulled out and the hole is left open.
I said it was to make the pain go away quickly.
Severe pain runs when I touch my teeth more than before treatment, but will it go away in a few days...
Pain relievers don't work at all either...
It will calm down after a few days.
I think now is the most painful time.

The body of a man was found in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! news
Before the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down and dying in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya.
The police are investigating the identity of the man and the cause of death.
According to the police, before 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down on the Shonai River in Nakashidanami, Moriyama-ku, and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but death was confirmed on the spot.
The police are rushing to confirm the identity and investigating the cause of death, etc.
Meanwhile, in Sunagawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki-shi, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river, and death was confirmed.
There was no disturbance in the man's clothing, but it means that a bicycle had collapsed nearby.
The police are rushing to confirm the identity and investigating the situation at that time.

Korea POSCO International Acquires Australia's Senex Energy and Expands Overseas Gas Field Business = Korea Report (WoW! (Korea) - Yahoo! news
POSCO INTERNATIONAL announced a stock acquisition agreement for Australia's Senex Energy (Senex Energy) on the 12th, and Hancock Energy (Hancock Energy) and Senex It was announced that it had signed an investment agreement for the acquisition of energy.

That knee pain may be “knee osteoarthritis”! ?
Treatment methods that differ depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! news
Editorial department: Recently, knee pain has continued.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, “osteoarthritis” is common among Japanese people.
Editorial department: Does it mean that joints deform?
Maruyama sensei: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, cartilage may wear out or become distorted due to aging, obesity, strenuous sports, etc.
As a result, it leads to joint deformation and inflammation.
Editorial department: Does osteoarthritis develop other than the knee?
Maruyama sensei: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the knuckles and bases of the hands, neck, hips, big toes, hip joints, etc.
However, the most common case is the case that occurs in the knee, and it is called “knee osteoarthritis.”
Editorial department: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: A joint is a combination of two bones in an uneven manner.
And the part where these two face each other is covered with “articular cartilage”, and the area around the joint is wrapped with a “joint capsule”.
Editorial department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Maruyama sensei: That's right.
There is a tissue called the synovial membrane in the inner layer of the joint capsule that makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that “hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate is good for smoothing knee movements.”
Editorial department: What symptoms occur when you have osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing direct collision between bones.
So to speak, it plays a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn out or distorted, it deforms or inflames the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basic pajamas, but when my pajamas are being washed, I sleep in jerseys or something!

I wonder if I should stop it somehow... and it seems that they stopped it as it was.

3 Gambling & Games in the “Kaiji” Series That You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! news
The gambling comic “Kaiji” series boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the real thrills of this game is the extreme game where you risk your life.
[Photo] My legs are swollen just by looking at it... Challenge the steel-framed crossing!
So this time I would like to verify Kaiji's games that can actually be played or are practiced in planned videos.
■Swamp This is a pachinko “swamp” full of traps that appeared in “Gambling Breaking Records Kaiji.”
In the original story, Kaiji was surprised at the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
Large traps of “Kugi no Mori,” “Movable Actors,” and “3-Tier Kroons,” were set in this “swamp”, and it was almost impossible to capture it.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of hands, and at the end he went on a rough job of placing a vinyl aquarium in a building, sinking the ground, and tilting it, and captured it brilliantly.
The “swamp” that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko game, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as “4000 yen per ball,” and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you can enjoy the feeling of Kaiji.
■Steel Frame Crossing What debtors, including Kaiji, carried out at the “Starside Party” held by rich people as entertainment is the steel-framed crossing of “human horse racing”.
The debtor proceeds while devising ways so that it does not fall on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground, and competes for its speed.
Twelve people participate, and the top 2 can win the prize money, but there are only 4 steel frames, safety measures are insufficient, and the possibility of death is quite high.
This steel-framed crossing has a high degree of danger, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is extremely close to the “Eagle Bridge” installed in “Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi,” the home of professional baseball Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles You can have an experience.
This eagle bridge has a steel-framed single bridge at a point with a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and a “sky swing” and a “victory bridge” are prepared ahead of it, and you can walk to it.
Of course, safety measures have been implemented.
Comedian Koala Koarashi released a video of walking the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube saying “you can experience steel-framed crossing in Japan,” and it became a hot topic.
■E-card “E-card” is a card game between 2 people.
A total of 10 cards are used: 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards, and 1 slave card, and are divided into emperor and slave sides to play.
This game is very well made, and it has the characteristics that the emperor is strong against citizens, the citizens are strong against slaves, and the slave is strong against the emperor.
Kaiji plays against Tonegawa in the play with a strict rule that “if you lose, your ears will be scraped off.”
After all, Kaiji realized that a device that destroys the ear, such as earbuds attached to the ear, senses and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, etc., to read psychology even after a big struggle. By scraping his own ears to the limit and making his body an abnormal value, he confused the Tone River and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon, etc.
On YouTube, a video of popular YouTuber Hikaru competing with Fujiwara Tatsuya, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, on an e-card was uploaded, which caused a lot of attention.
■Is there a way to try feeling like Kaiji?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read comics, you only feel like it.
Why don't you feel that worldview through the game.
One step towards the new year, gently boosting the large votive plaque of a tiger at Gokoku Shrine in the prefecture | Yamagata Shimbun
A large ema of the zodiac sign (uh) “tiger (tiger)” next year has appeared at the prefectural Gokoku-jinja Shrine (Yamagata City) where preparations for the New Year are progressing.
Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed it visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication festival was held in front of the gods.
The shrine has been requesting original drawings of ema from students of the University of Art and Technology since the year before last.
This time, the work of Tsuchiya Yui (22) for 3 years was adopted from among the nine people in the Japanese Painting Course in the Art Department taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.
It is said that Mr. Tsuchiya drew it with “an image where cherry blossoms gently push your back as you step into the new year.”
The appearance of the tiger stopping and looking at the cherry blossoms included a wish that “even in a drastically changing world, we can afford to celebrate the beauty of nature.”
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on votive plaques distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba (44) of Gon Negi (Gon Negi) said, “I think it will help all people overcome difficulties.”

Let's think about “Tamano I want to continue living” Recommendations 4 high school students workshop in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | Ms. Desi
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
Student representatives from 4 high schools in Tamano City are jointly working on a workshop to think about “Tamano I want to continue living in.”
As part of the investigation and policy recommendation project of the intermediate support organization “Tamano SDGs Mirai Development Center,” the live voices of young people are compiled and proposed to the mayors.
“When is it fun? ”.
Students answer the facilitator's questions verbally, such as “when you get excited with a lot of people” or “when you're playing drums.”
The first time it was held at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13.
It is a “interesting town,” “a town that is easy to live in,” and “a town where you can feel the purpose of life,” using the method of “world cafe” where 18 high school students and local people discuss while moving around the “island” with a fixed theme I thought about it.
Write out each idea on a sticky note and stick it on imitation paper to organize it.
“Towns with many young people seem interesting,” “Transportation such as trains and buses is indispensable for ease of living in.”
We will discuss further whether there is anything in common.
“I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the seaside is attractive,” said Tamano Commerce and Industry 3rd year student (18).
Binan High School 3rd year student (18) seems to have noticed not only regional issues but also attractiveness by talking with adults, saying, “There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but places rich in nature are good.”
At the 2nd session in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the recommendations.
We plan to invite the mayor and superintendent of education to announce it in February next year as well.
Chairman Higashi Rie of the center says, “I hope it fosters the love of the hometown of high school students and it will be an opportunity for young people to be actively involved in town development.”

How to find a new way to wind a stall (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! news
It's an indispensable stole in winter, but do you have times when the cloth gets sluggish around your neck?
It's a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding it, but sometimes I hear voices saying that I don't know the trick quite well.
When I thought that if there was a stall that could be rolled up quickly without the cloth being sluggish... I found something novel.
The stole of the brand “COTTORI (Kotori)” has a long side of about 1 meter, which is a more compact size than a general one.
When I first saw it, “Is it so short that it can be wound? ”
If you look closely, it is tailored into one piece by knitting an elongated cloth, and the whole is in the shape of a net.
The end of the stall can be passed through the mesh.
So you can roll it up and fasten it without tying end to end.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilet (vest) is popular even for outerwear, but there are many people who wear it in combination with a stole so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I'm sure it would be convenient to have a stall like this.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's a guy called Get Buck directed by Peter Jackson
It feels like the vivid, or rather life-size Beatles, and it's a lot of fresh...
I'm doing giggiss because it's just before the breakup, but it's not the dramatic gigginess I imagined
While doing my best to partition, “I know I'm annoying, but come on!” Paul, who is troublesome like that, or George who feels lazy about “But Sa ~”, or John who is late and unmotivated while saying opinions and jokes rather calmly... Ringo who plays the role of chilling I don't actively pinch my mouth, and I'm sitting in the back with my face saying “troubled nya”
I don't dislike each other enough to fight like that, but there's a great feeling in the air of “Well, it's impossible to work together anymore, isn't it?” and the Beatles felt like that too I wonder if that's the dismantling of an interesting legend
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really full of talent
From a little phrase, each other said, “How's this going?” The process of finishing it in “That Famous Song” while I'm doing it is dangerous
In particular, the moment when the title Get Buck is created is amazing
It's amazing that the scene where a casual humming song like Hoon Hoon Hoon gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics are included is well recorded
It's amazing that you can't watch the process of composing a song like this
Well, it's natural, but everyone is riding fat, so you can be happy just watching the performance scene
It still seems to be 1 out of 3 episodes, but so far I had the impression that the biggest cause of the dissolution was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves
If the four of you start making songs while complaining somehow, it seems fun, but what do you do at the concert venue? When it comes to the story, producers and advertisers say, “After all, the Beatles start with the best in the world!” It was easy to understand that they had already left their hands by saying that it was like a glue like that
Well, documentaries are also interpreted by the director, so it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising it, so I thought it might be because of that that that there are many scenes where Paul looks like a bad guy

I'm sure they have a serious personality, so I felt a sense of responsibility, and I thought that there was no room in my heart more and more.
I think it's tough to live a little bit now, right?
I'm from a sales position, but I'm sick to death and changed jobs, but at that time I'm not good at doing sales activities from myself, but I thought it was very suitable for sales activities that are needed by customers, so it's a different industry, but that's the case When I chose a job and changed jobs, it became very easy to work.
I was told that I couldn't do it, but I think my way of life in the future will be somewhat easier if I can find something I'm good at or can do even a little within myself.
← Of course, I think it's enough to think about this after you have a leisurely rest and relax in your mind.
However, I think there is also a daily life, so if there is a company union, an occupational physician, or a window where you can consult with them, etc., there may be some kind of system if you consult with them, so is it a good idea to consult with them once It seems that it is.
It would be nice if I could live my life with even a little easier feeling in the future.

Severe damage due to frequent tornadoes in the United States The effects of unseasonable warmth and strong cold (Weather News) - Yahoo! news
From the night of the 10th (Fri) to the 11th (Sat) local time, tornadoes occurred frequently, mainly in the southern United States.
It seems that the atmospheric condition became extremely unstable due to the influence of strong chills moving southward in places that were record warmth for this period, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern part of the United States from the southwest, and it became a record high temperature.
In Houston, Texas, the highs on the 9th (Thu) and 10th (Fri) local time have risen to close to 30℃.
Strong chills below -30° C descended southward around 5500m above the sky where it was such a record warmth, so an active front line was formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly followed the front line development.
It seems that tornadoes have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern part of the United States is originally an area where tornadoes are likely to occur, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases where major damage occurs during this time of year.
The number of tornado warnings announced in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and wind gusts on the 10th (Friday) local time alone.
According to this, we can see that there are two concentrated areas roughly divided into the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the line on the north side, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached EF3, which is the third from the strongest of the six stages, and it is believed that a gust of wind around 70m/s blew instantaneously.
Depending on future surveys, there is a possibility that it will be judged as EF4 to 5.
In Japan, JEF (Japan Version Improved Fujita Scale) is used based on the Improved Fujita Scale, which is tailored to the conditions of Japanese buildings, etc.
There is a good possibility that JEF3, which is equivalent to the American tornado this time, will occur in Japan, and it is a level where wooden houses will collapse.

There are also calls for help on a live broadcast from under the debris of the rice tornado “the biggest in history” (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! news
Regarding tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, US President Biden expressed his opinion on the 11th (Japan time 12th) with a mystical face that it was “one of the largest tornadoes in US history.”
US CNN TV and others reported.
Mr. Biden emphasized that “we will do everything as a federal government.”
“We still don't know the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost,” he explained.
There was a fear that the death toll would exceed 100 people.
[Photo] Residents carrying household items etc. from broken houses in Kentucky damaged by tornadoes From the night of the 10th to the early dawn of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As for the damage area of tornadoes, there is a record of 219 miles (about 350 km) that damaged Missouri, etc. in 1925, but CNN weather experts in the United States have this time about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers), the largest scale I also made a trial calculation that it was.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was heavily damaged, a candle factory that was in operation 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas sales season was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were on duty, but the building was destroyed and there were no traces.
In the dark, a woman stuck under debris about 1.5 meters thick felt the weight of rescuers searching the top of the debris and asked for help on a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the singing voice of “Happy Birthday to You,” which seems to have been sung while screaming and crying to confuse fear by another woman, also echoed in the live broadcast that was released.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son because a tornado advisory was issued, and was safe.
“There are many people who compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a horrible sound like the sound of the earth that made something more erupt,” he recalled.
A Mayfield Police Department officer said, “We will continue search activities until we no longer need it.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will be,” he continued his hard rescue operation.
In Illinois, a part of the warehouse of Amazon, a major online shopping company, collapsed, and at least six deaths were confirmed.
The train cars derailed due to the impact that they were cut off, and expressways have also been blocked one after another due to the effects of vehicle falls over.
According to US web media, a total of about 400,000 houses, including 130,000 in Tennessee, have had power outages.
I have few platelets.

It has long been a discourse that the way of thinking about star rating systems is different.
It is argued that while other countries will deduct points from there based on 5 stars, Japan will add/deduct points with 3 stars as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars have completely different meanings between “there is a point deduction element” and “it is not a masterpiece, but an honorable mention.”
If 5 stars are used as a standard, “works with only no shortcomings” and “works of the highest standard in everything” will be in line with each other, so if there is such a tendency, that is, on a system that does not present the meaning of stars I think it's a defect, but since such an operation is actually being carried out on such a system, you are saying that I don't want you to give it 3 stars (notoriety).
So if you try to refute people who insist on this kind of discourse with Steam's two-choice evaluation, the story will not mesh.

＜Saga Eating Aru Chronic＞ “Seasonal Fried Fish and Fried Shrimp Caught in the Near Sea Homemade Tartar Sauce” by “Hakobune” | Lifestyle & Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LIVE
Bento “Seasonal fried fish and shrimp caught in the coastal waters homemade tartar sauce”
“HAKOBUNE” is a takeout specialty store that specializes in colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) that use plenty of vegetables.
Mr. and Mrs. Katsuki Takayuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened it in August last year, saying, “So that people can enjoy the feeling of a restaurant at home.”
One of the popular bento menus is the “Seasonal Fried Fish and Fried Shrimp Caught in the Near Sea Homemade Tartar Sauce” (1000 yen).
I choose good fish from time to time at the market.
It is said that “raw bread crumbs are applied as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients in fries” (Mr. Takayuki), and you can directly see the plump texture of fried shrimp.
The bento comes with about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli as a garnish, and rice with millet grains on rice divided by Hinohikari from Saga prefecture, and soup.
Vegetables are purchased homemade from soba fields or at direct sales offices in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the season, etc., but Takayuki has accumulated French training, and lappe and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, it is a mix of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as “a familiar and relieved taste” (Mr. Yumi) like dashi rolled eggs.
The bento “domestic minced meat hand-kneaded hamburger steak” (1000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, the “charcuterie set,” a processed meat product that goes well with alcoholic beverages such as wine, will also be on sale.

However, since it is leisurely, you can relax while watching the scenery, so I thought it would be a good vehicle if there were a little fewer people

Actually, it's “! Eggplant!” That's it! (If you tap it, the correct answer will come out)
I like eels, but in fact, everyone eats them with sauce, and I thought that the part of the eel could be anything other than the actual degree of grilling... I thought that the texture and volume of an eel are pretty important.

The long road of a family that took root in environmental protection activities on the frontier of China (JBPress) - Yahoo! news
(Yuki Kato: Hong Kong company Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, which has a vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the largest number of mammals inhabiting it and the third largest variety of plants in the world.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection carried out by local governments, but also activities of environmental activists.
Xisapanna (Xishuangbanna) in Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such region.
Her younger sister, Lee Yat-san, is currently active as an actress Sisapanna is an area bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and many ethnic minorities live there, including the “Thai (Thai) tribe,” which shares roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand It's an area where it is
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flows.
Xisapanna Tai (Xishuangbanna Dai) Autonomous Prefecture The area of Xisapanna is only about 0.2% of the whole of China, but it is home to about 25% of species of wild animals and 20% of varieties of plants.
This time, we met Mr. Lee Min-ga, who is engaged in environmental protection activities at Sisapanna, on site and talked about the contents of the activities.
■ Start environmental protection activities with my German husband ― ― I asked about 20 years since we started environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger for that?
Mr. Li Our environmental protection activity “Tianzi” started its activities in 2000.
The trigger was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted some of the most biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was also lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests progressed in order to take root in the region and to produce rubber, which was scarce in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
Then, I got to know me, who was a reporter here, and got married.
― Did Mr. Lee not have an interest in nature conservation before that?
Mr. Lee I'm from Sisapanna, but I wasn't interested in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though they don't have a well-formed face or are not particularly tall, but why do you think this is the case?

It is something that comes out naturally the moment you feel confident in yourself. and.
I'm sure that person has a solid sense of confidence on the inside.

I suddenly think, is it detailed to say that the other party's clothes are homely or that the color is good?
It's not fine, right?
It's something you can see, though.
I don't think it's fine
I've never been told to praise and be detailed, so I don't know a bit what it means to say it.
I wonder if they praised them in detail or something.
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
I'm going out with you by replying, “Sakura-san confessed, my heart is in full bloom in spring, please do this one.”
And in order to socialize, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
If I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but I choose not to open an NISA account now, is it possible to open it at the timing I want to open it later?
If you open it at the same time, the procedure will be completed faster.
It will be completed in about a week now.
Apart from that, there is no fee, so we recommend that you open an NISA account at the same time so that you can use it as soon as you want to use it.

[Oma Tamak/Personal Remarks] Something that is the cause of CTD in the MOD's own environment and it took about one and a half months to identify
CTD due to multiple factors was occurring while stable data until March did not have much time to play from around Golden Week, and it took a lot of time to identify it as if I investigated it little by little only mainly on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze logs with the.Net Script Framework (if you do, you'll know it in a few minutes)?. Some errors related to dll series and mesh-related errors do not remain in the crash log.
〇 Main CTD timings
* All do not leave footprints in the logs of Papyrus and.Net Script Framework, and.dll plug-ins of the type that leave logs.
* When some NPC kills/attacks are cumulative: Also activated on console Kill → Essentials Be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ PowerOfThree SE update resumed version) OFF Improvement*Is there a possibility of wet clothing about this?
* When camera work is activated for some NPCs → Kill move setting off by PC is turned off via the.ini Basic improvement: Setting conflict in DAR+Nemesis relationship? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit
* (Basic outdoor) During field moving+some magic (example: Freeze Rune) is activated, when NPC is hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) 5 times with all OFF Everything improved with continuous trials.
Is it due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or shader mistakes in the body mesh? In addition, there is a formatting mistake in the 2.0 SPID usage default.ini, but as a result, it is the intended result, and the prerequisite perk should have been applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking by putting wet clothes on motion/combat mods (.dll ones) related to site attacks and OnHit, but the results looked like this.
I don't think there were similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French level.
In the unlikely event that there are people who have similar CTD problems in the Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reminder, so I posted it.
Relatively everyone is doing it with a last-minute mental mind,
People around you don't notice it, let alone colleagues or family members.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that person often works well even though it seems difficult.
But probably he's also a last-minute mental person.
I haven't retired in the name of mental health, but I think it was my limit just before retirement.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing-After today's home-visit nursing is over
I have bipolar disorder, so I have been receiving home-visit nursing for a long time, but I have been in a long relationship with the nurse (woman) at the home-visit nursing station I use now, and I think I have a very good relationship It's there.
I talk about a lot of things every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (packaging, etc.), but more than anything else, today's home-visit nursing is how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illnesses I thought about it all the time.
Today I'm going to discuss chat about gender differences between men and women, or gender theory lol.
Is it OK to do home-visit nursing for things like male and female libido or why she got divorced? I'm also going to talk about something like that.
Occasionally, there are times when I dress as a woman.
However, in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only responds clerical, or even though an occupational therapist comes for home-visit nursing, “This is medical care I've heard stories from acquaintances that people give instructions from above, such as “I'm doing it.”
What I use is a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think she is a really good nurse who faces Frank on an equal footing with me who has a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful lol.
There may be people who are receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing, and there are also people who are thinking about receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illnesses.

Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, 1/5 of China... “Delayed in Implementation of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap” (JoongAng Ilbo, Japanese version) - Yahoo! news
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The content was that 65,000 fuel cell vehicles would be spread (cumulative total) by 2012, and 310 hydrogen stations would be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was 6000 won (about 577 yen) per kilo.
However, according to the November standard this year, fuel cell vehicles are only at the 27% level of the target (about 17,000 units).
The core infrastructure hydrogen station popularization schedule is also 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is in the 8400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It turns out that the government's implementation status of the hydrogen economy roadmap is well below the target value.
The National Federation of Business People (Zenkeiren) announced the report “Current Status and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economic Ecosystems” on the 12th.
According to the report, the fact is that most of the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States, Japan, etc.
Carbon fiber, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts are supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane membranes are supplied by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany) that lead the global hydrogen market has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
South Korea ranks 5th in the world in terms of the number of patents (2014-2020 cumulative total) in the hydrogen production and fuel cell fields.
However, the Zenkeiren reported that “in fact, six countries occupy the majority of the global hydrogen market, and in fact, it means that they are lower among competing countries.”
The patent ranking by country is in the order of China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China surpassed the United States and came in first place, the difference has widened.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) and ranked fourth, but it is 22% level of China (4721).
Zenkeiren proposed that “hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax credit range for capital investment and research and development expenses.”

From Meiji to Showa, were older sister wives in the minority compared to now?
I think there were a lot of older sisters and wives.
That's because the phrase “older sister's wife” has come to be said in the streets.
And in the old days, a wife who was one year older said, “Look for it even if you wear gold waraji.” I was told, so I think there were many wives who were older than they are now in the Meiji and Showa eras.

Parliament on Sunday?
, TV program-style leaflet creation Parliamentary reform is underway in Takasu, and the “correspondence book” of parliamentarians: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as creating unusual leaflets to guide the holding of regular meetings and introducing a “correspondence book” where townspeople evaluate councilors.
The town council election has been vote-free for the third consecutive term, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested in it.
In order to publicize the Sunday parliament held on the 12th, about 1800 new leaflets were distributed in newspaper inserts on the 9th.
“Morning to Raw Giron,” “Tetsuko's Room,” “Sawaguchi Hitoshi Expedition Series”...
The leaflets distributed by the town council to all households on the 9th have wording reminiscent of popular TV program names.
Councilor Katayama Hyoe (43), who created it, says, “I want you to laugh a lot and go to the parliament.”

U.S. Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrives in Ukraine Engaged in Troop Training (Cnn.co.jp) - Yahoo! news
(CNN) US State Department officials reported by the 12th that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine based on the security aid plan approved by President Biden.
The total amount of military aid is equivalent to 60 million dollars (about 6.8 billion yen), and at the beginning of the year, the last equipment, including four radars that identify launch sites such as mortars, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to US Department of Defense spokesperson Kirby, these aids also included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles “javelins.”
The purpose of military support is to strengthen the national defense capabilities of Ukraine, which has received military strength build-up etc. promoted by the Russian army around the border with Ukraine.
The United States has increased its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, discussed with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states, and is also working out countermeasures in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the US White House on September 1 this year.
Military support by the United States to Ukraine reached a scale of about 450 million dollars this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has risen to more than 2.5 billion dollars.
The US military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian army.
Last month, the National Guard of Florida in the United States was dispatched in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan supported by Ukraine.
According to a statement by the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Force in Europe also plays a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a confidential matter in the execution of operations.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but tense exchanges were also exchanged in the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The whereabouts of the inheritance/gift tax “review” that makes gifts “forbidden” during life, directly hit Akira Amari, the former tax control chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first special feature of the December 18 issue of “Weekly Diamond” is “Talking with my family during the New Year holidays!
It is a “gift before life, rush in inheritance art”.
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, it was postponed in the 2022 tax system reform outline, which was a concern, but in the near future, there is a great possibility that gifts before life, which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures, will become a “forbidden hand”.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Along with a direct hit on the former tax control chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and a member of the House of Representatives Akira Amari, I will teach you everything from the basic keys of gifts and inheritance for advantageous rush gifts to tax saving techniques in time for the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department Miyahara Hiroaki)
● From the viewpoint of grasping and taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, “Towards the construction of a tax system that is neutral to the selection of the timing of asset transfer, from the viewpoint of grasping and taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrally, with the aim of building a tax system that is neutral to the selection of the timing of asset transfer We will proceed with the study” ―.
A big upset spread not only to wealthy people but also to the middle class in one sentence of the 2021 tax system reform outline announced by the ruling party last year.
This is because what I'm trying to say means that we will aim for a large increase in inheritance tax by completely changing the rules of inheritance and making “gifts before life,” which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures, a “forbidden hand”.
The cardinal rule of tax saving measures for inheritance tax, which is highly progressive, is to “reduce property subject to taxation.”
The gift before life, which is the strongest trump card, has been widely used not only by asset owners, but also by office workers who incur inheritance tax even though it is a small amount due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Under such circumstances, the discussion of “integration of inheritance tax and gift tax” sprung up.
Although it was postponed in the FY22 tax system reform outline announced on December 10, when there was concern about the fastest introduction, “we will review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar year gift system” and “tax exemption measures for gift tax Since it is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (...) we will constantly review it.” A policy for integration has been set out again with more advanced wording.
In an interview with this editorial department, the former tax system investigation chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, and former Secretary General Amari Akira, said.
“The most important thing is to lose the advantage and disadvantage due to the timing of property transfer, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when you go.
Currently, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (due to integration).” If it is the fastest revision, there are still 3 chances of giving gifts before life left.
Even if this is not the case, there seems to be no doubt that in the near future, it will take a big stab in the direction of invalidating gifts during life as a tax saving measure.
So how will the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change specifically?

“My Right Big Brother” Terrestrial Broadcasting Furukawa Yudai from 2022 1/10 “Please stay tuned! ”
It has been decided that the FOD original drama “My Right Brother,” starring Yudai Furukawa, will be broadcast terrestrial on Fuji Television from midnight on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Hanazumi Yamatani in the role of the heroine This work based on the comic of the same name by Satoshi Morie, which has been serialized in Kodansha's “BE · LOVE” since 2018, is a pure love story that is too sad between a man and a woman carrying the past.
Furukawa serves as the main character Kairi, and Yamatani Hanazumi serves as the heroine Riyo.
Riyo, a university student, meets a senior who works part-time, Kairi.
Haili, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly if he borrows Riyo's shoulder for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has vestiges similar to his older brother who survived due to her parents' divorce, but isn't Kairi a murderer because of a certain trigger?
・Yudai Furukawa's comment drama “My Right Brother” will be broadcast on terrestrial waves from 1/10!
I would like people who couldn't see it on FOD to look forward to it, and those who have already seen it see the complex psychological depiction of Kaili and Riyo after knowing the development, and the state of the two people in conflict and changing I think if you get it, you will be able to know this work more deeply.
I would be happy if fans of the original story would also enjoy it.
Please stay tuned!

[NFL] What and how did the team players who won 1 game pass 3 times feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! news
In this game, Jones threw a pass = the Patriots only passed three times.
This was a small number of times in the NFL in the past 50 years since the two passes recorded by the Bills against the New York Jets in the 3rd week of 1974.
In the 1974 Bills, there was an unprecedented genius RB named O.J. Simpson, who exceeded 2000 yards in the season for the first time in history in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason why the Patriots developed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and in terms of latitude it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius, the wind with a wind speed of 18 m blew, and there was a blizzard before the game.
The Bills were only local, and they didn't change their play selections much.
There are 25 runs compared to 30 passes.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was by no means impossible.
There was a scoring machine, with 4 red zone invasions in the 10th offensive series.
Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, it progressed to the red zone three times in a row.
However, I was only able to get 3 points in 1 FG in those 3 times.
Defense in front of goal in the final game of the game.
The Bills, chasing 4 points, committed a penalty in 3rd & 9, and became 3rd & 14.
It's 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd & 14, QB Allen flowed to the right out of the pocket, surrounded by the rush of the Patriots defense.
Then he threw a pass aiming for TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but he failed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran Sharo-Across and went free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen didn't get into Allen's eyes.
On the 4th & 18, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the outside left, but the pass was hit by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in the foreground and ended in failure.
Bryant was covering WR Cole Beasley of the Bills one-on-one, but he saw Allen's movements on the way and released Beasley and responded to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw passes aiming for the end zone on both occasions.
The 4th down pass may have been a decisive hit, but there was no need to aim for TD for the 3rd down.
You just need to take the first down in two plays.
It was still 2 minutes ago, so if I set it to 4th & short, Allen's ability, who also has his own run, should have lived.

3 Items That Tend to Be Placed in the Kitchen for a Long Period of Time That Are “Time to Throw Away” & “When to Replace” (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! news
sponges
No matter how often you change them, it's probably sponges that you haven't changed as often as recommended.
From research in 2017, it is known that even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, a lot of bacteria breed (it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
German researchers who did the study recommend changing sponges once a week to keep them clean.
chopping board
The United States Department of Agriculture points out that cutting boards should be replaced if they start to wear out, scratches and grooves form.
This is because once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria breed.

FlashBIOS never ends help
I bought the Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced it with the B550 and Tomaho I bought in September
Once I went to the BIOS settings screen, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the point that seemed to be a white cursor did not flash on the black screen and it was in a state where it was accepted all the time
Even if I think the BIOS is damaged and I try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, it doesn't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems that it will end in about 5 minutes, but it won't end even in 1 hour
The probable cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the guy who converts the SD card and uses it

I'm embarrassed to have brand-name products for some reason.
If it is inconspicuous, you can hold it, but you can't hold it if it has Lv written on it in a big monogram like Vuitton or something.
Why is that?
I think it's good that it fits your own length.
By the way, I think Japan would be good.
If it's Japan That's it.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin style.
It's better to say it early, “Why am I the only one who abandons it/is a bad mouth?” That's it
So it doesn't matter because it's a foreigner? It's better to simply say that it's uncomfortable when it comes to that.
I don't think I've ever dreamed that I'm probably uncomfortable with a decent probability
I was living overseas on the way, but there were times when Japanese people who went outside, including me, didn't like the Confucian conventions up and down, and there were so many people who came and misunderstood that it was okay to say anything to the locals whether the tag was off .
If it looks like Westerners, there is no offense purely, and I think they do so with a kind of indulgence or rather a friendly feeling.
If my friend is from Europe or the United States, I would call them out by the name below, but when I speak in Japanese, there are moments when I'm a little lost as to which one to choose.
Well, if it's a friend, it's still good.
I guess the original is just doing it purely normally, but if you overlook it, it may not be possible to stop the exceptional treatment of being Gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Since it's Japan, I wonder if you can talk according to Japanese rules
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do that, you won't be strangely slammed by either younger or older people, or they'll be treated like Japanese people.
Because there are people (including me) who look at such details regardless of personality in Japanese people

Thank you for the 50 subscribers!
When I opened Reddit today, this sable that I just made exceeded 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I was wondering if it would take a little longer until 50 people went, but for some reason 25 people subscribed today alone, so I'm very grateful.
I would appreciate it if people could tell me where they learned about this sable in the comments section because I subscribed to this sable today! (I'm really worried because I have no idea)
I'm the only person who currently stands up threads, so I would appreciate it if everyone could set up threads as well.
It would be encouraging if you could make comments etc. even if you don't put up a thread.
Maybe they use Reddit, but there are few people who use Twitter.
If you're using Twitter, please stand up a thread by all means!
Finally, thank you so much! The sable I made before was immediately frustrated because people didn't gather as I thought, but this time it seems that thanks to everyone, I can continue without getting frustrated.
I will do my best to make it easy to use sable by maintaining wikis and rules well, etc., so thank you for your continued support!

I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that if it is a small company, it is a person who translates well.
I think it is possible for people who are not native Japanese to understand the differences in the fine nuances of Japanese even after studying for a long period of time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable, it's a good idea to look for someone else.

Discussion “Demon Slayer” training is the battle.
“Equivalent Exchange of Effort” is a human hymn ＜Commemorating the start of the anime “Yukaku Edition” ＞ (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! news
What makes “Demon Slayer” particularly heterogeneous among recent shonen comics is that “there is a lot of training.”
It has become an established theory that in most cases there are no battles, and training editions that train at dawn or dusk are not popular with readers.
That's because even in the same jump comic “ONE PIECE,” there was a two-year training when the Straw Hat Pirates became separated, but I drew only the touch and skipped the rest briskly You should know it by guessing it.
Well, one of the attractions of dresses is the eccentricity of the land they cross, and there are times when “staying in the same place and training” is not so compatible.
By the way, the training of Tanjiro, the main character of “Demon Slayer,” was prostrate to Yoshiatsu Tomioka, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, and said, “Don't let others seize the right to take life and death! ! It can be said that it started when I was told by a volunteer.
The weak have no rights or options, they can only be screwed down by the strong with all their power...
While saying that, it was the kindness of volunteer courage that introduced Sakonji Rinotaki, a “nurturer” who trains those who wish to enlist in the Demon Slayer Squad (he is also a bad community that does not explain its intentions).
In the first contact between Tanjiro and Rinotaki, he was asked, “What do you do when your sister eats people,” and Tanjiro, who was stuck in an answer, said “judgment is slow.”
At first glance, it's an unreasonable exchange of storytellers even among fans.
However, taking my sister who has become an ogre with me is conceived of the possibility that the moment when I will be forced to make such a decision may come.
It can be said that it is an initiative to enter training from a mental attitude.
However, Rinotaki takes Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri, and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air in the mountains is thin and full of pitfalls, trebuchets, and traps, and they seem to die before they start training.
Even so, it is barely a “protagonist correction” to sniff out the faint smell of traps set by human hands with a sharp sense of smell possessed and somehow avoid it.
Still, “that's why my physical ability doesn't suddenly increase enough to be able to avoid all of that all of a sudden! ! Making Tanjiro say, is probably the essence of what makes Demon Slayer Demon Slayer a demon slayer.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become stronger without any support, and the only thing that awakens is that they can use “the power and skills they have polished up until then” with their original potential.
“Equivalent Exchange of Effort,” which rewards those who have made efforts only a lot, and does not reward anything for efforts that have not been made, is a human anthem that is different from demons who can have unfounded paranormal powers, and it is a rule that is difficult to move that is consistent with this work .
Is this old?
It's not yet a bed, but a way of sleeping where you lay a mat directly in the house and sleep on a mattress or comforter.
My house isn't a condominium.
I'm doing that too.
If you use a room widely, it's better to sleep on a futon rather than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Is it crazy?
Are people who work part-time and work in contact with other stores who want to work full time are crazy?
No, I don't think so in particular.
In that case, it doesn't correspond to the “gametsui” I think.
I think it is “frustrating” to plan to somehow obtain more profit than labor with minimal effort.
Are there any smoking cessation outpatient clinics nationwide now?
I'm doing it everywhere.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics establishes a new “DX Division” that integrates home appliances and mobiles, and “emphasizes user experience” (WoW! (Korea) - Yahoo! news
Following the integration of the CE and IM divisions by Samsung Electronics as a set division, the name was decided to be DX (Device Experience), and it was announced on the 12th that this would be reflected in the organizational reorganization at the end of the year.
You can read the purpose of enhancing the user experience (experience) through a variety of services from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics has VD (Visual Display), Household Appliances, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile Experience) for the newly launched DX division by integrating CE and IM divisions It was revealed that it consists of divisions such as networks, etc.

I want it to be a heavier and stiff expression.
> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything That stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> Hanmyo larvae ambush in the sand to capture their prey at any time, showing only the disk-shaped head out of the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
The larvae of Hanmyo ambush in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, and only the disk-shaped head peeks out of the sand.
I think it should be.
What bothers me
* Did you refer to other documentaries
* Are you looking at it from the perspective of an ant
Is it?
I think that if you translate armoured heads as disk-shaped heads, the part that says “on the ant scale, it's a giant beast wearing a helmet” will disappear...
Is the driver of the Aichi 24 collision trailer careless without a chronic illness (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! news
In an accident where 24 cars collided in Komaki, Aichi prefecture, it became known that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent to the police did not have a chronic illness, and it seems that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 cars, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people were lightly injured.
The police arrested Suspect Nomura Katsuya (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of first causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent it to the police on the morning of the 12th.
Suspect Nomura's trailer continued to proceed without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed how Suspect Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, it became known that Suspect Nomura did not have a chronic illness, and it seems that some kind of carelessness is the cause.
The police are searching the parties involved and investigating the situation in detail at that time.

Kinnikuman Review by Oginuma X [Comics Vol. 4] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! news
The 20th Superman Olympics, which began with volume 3, are completed with these 4 volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume, which drew everything from the opening to the semifinals all at once, it is full of new tricks because it focused on only one game!
● [Kinnikuman] Volume 4 review contributor name Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Choujin Pro Wrestling has already started even before the game!
In a nutshell, these 4 volumes are one book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman vs. Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it is by no means a volume that depicts only the game on the ring It means that there is no
Starting with the signing ceremony, it's hard to go to the game because it's completely different from that point, such as each other's traction battle and special training scenes, etc., but that's never boring either.
This feeling in the work, in which the sense of tension that the first game of the century will finally begin gradually increases, surely leads to an increase in the tension of readers, and I am amazed that even this period is a production that is actually calculated.
And before the important final, another mountain that you can't miss is the 3rd place match between Terry Man and Ramen Man.
In addition to the luxury of being a match card, what I like is that Ramen Man says to the Kinnikuman poster behind the scenes before the game, “From now on, it's my turn to aim for! ! ”
and try to slam the chops.
However, it is a scene where a terry man who happens to pass by accepts the hand sword and stops it, stares at each other silently, and breaks up with just that.
What's amazing about this is that both have already been eliminated, and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.
But there is such a person who wears agony around that Kinnikuman.
If something like this is shown, I can't help but think about the activities of the distant future!
It's one act that still makes me keenly aware as a manga artist that this is what it means for a character to stand up!
The battle between the two ends without dividing that much scale, but the famous scene is the tearful complaint of Ramen Man after the game.
To Kinnikuman, “Don't rely only on the strength of Kamikari's luck! ! ”
It's a line called.
Is this already called a grand meta statement against the work itself, until now, readers also feel that Kinnikuman won't lose because it's the main character after all, and it's somehow winning where it's not his ability I think it was.
But by making Ramen Man make this statement, Yudetamago-sensei took the lead on his own and stabbed a nail that he couldn't use his hands anymore.
With this one word, the reader said, “Oh, then will Kinnikuman defeat Robin with his ability?
How do you do it? ”
You will be able to stir up your imagination again by the unseen development in the future, and if you look at it from another writer's perspective, this is the same line that Yudetamago-sensei, who makes the work, imposed restrictions on himself.
I think this was an amazing thing to do.
I think it's definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Held in Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! news
The first winter illumination has begun at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illumination that began on November 26 is studded with 50,000 LED bulbs according to walking paths and lawns, etc., including camphor trees with a height of 20 meters.
Visitors from Shiga prefecture said, “I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there is a place like this.
It's so beautiful, and I'm relieved.”
The illumination was planned for the first time so that people can feel healing while avoiding crowds, and it is lit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25.
Also, on the 25th of the last day, as a Christmas event, the behavior of button pots and movie screenings will also be held.

(Actually, it's easier to understand if you learn from Linux or something rather than suddenly touching something with a high degree of abstraction like Docker.

) You don't have to do it in order.
Also, it's not about memorizing the contents, but it seems that only the place where I skipped the previous reading is somehow memorized and read it when necessary.
I didn't read anything and suddenly broke it up with practice, and then repeated reading, so I gradually began to read it.

Internet distribution, agricultural and livestock products PR Okitama Agricultural Promotion Cooperative, relay from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
The Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities and JAs in the Okitama area, etc., developed PR activities for agricultural and livestock products utilizing “live commerce,” which sells products while distributing videos on the Internet, on the 11th.
Yamagata Ai's warlords and others made a remote appearance on the “Nationwide Cooperation MINATO (Minato) Market TV” planned for the first time by Minato Ward in Tokyo, and delivered the appeal of the region along with local specialties.
The opening of the store was decided due to the “Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project,” an initiative in which the Okitama area and Minato Ward cooperate, and it was relayed from Satoyama Vision House in Minamiharashinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who works as a “satoyama sommelier,” wears a stall from the Yonezawa textile brand “Nitorito (Nitorito)” and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
The state of the imoni party was also delivered with Ai no Bushotai.
At the studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo “Dandelion” and YouTubers with more than 300,000 registered users sample Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, etc.
When I conveyed the deliciousness to viewers, comments rave about it flew around, such as “the smell is transmitted even though it's a broadcast” and “it's the best with a lot of delicious (hey) bad things in alcoholic beverages.”
Is there a way to POST what I get in a form on the same PHP page?
<input>If there is a value in an element in the form, etc.,
Isn't that what it is?
I want to plant bellflower in my garden.
Are bellflower resistant to summer heat?
Then, when the flowers end in spring, let's cut the stems leaving 10 to 15 cm,
Branches come out from the base of the leaves, so please look forward to it.
Congratulations on the new year.
I just came back from hatsumode with my girlfriend.
Her smile is wonderful in the new year, isn't it?
It's a question
How do you spend New Year's holidays?
Please let me hear
Congratulations on the new year!
Lovey dovey is fine\ (^o^)/
There was a misfortune this morning...
The PC for NAS can no longer turn on 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
1.) In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
The PC is energized at this time.
2.) When I returned to my room a little later, I noticed that the PC was making a sound like a pink rotor, and shut it down for now.
At this point, I thought it was just that the movement of the fan was getting worse due to the drop in room temperature (6℃).
So I decided to try it again after warming up the room.
3.) It doesn't start up.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is on only for a moment, and the fan also works, but it stops immediately.
After that, I won't say poop or sun.
I unplugged the power plug and tried it again, but it still only turns on for a moment.
4.) Connect the motherboard to ATX20 pin, 4 pin only, remove the other parts and try it, but it doesn't start.
5.) It seems that the PSU fan is hitting something for a long time, and there has been a buzzing sound, so I suspect that the PSU is the cause.
I'll find the remaining ATX power supply at a later date and try it out.
Maybe.
If that's not enough... what should I do.
Do you want to change the case and mother together...
Have you seen wild rabbits recently (within the last 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Is it a place surrounded by nature?
I live in Tohoku.
They're everywhere near my house.
They are also in the garden or in the company parking lot.
Ranking of commonly used emojis in 2021 (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! news
The most frequently used emoji for me is the crying emoji.
I think emojis are an indispensable communication tool for modern people.
Recently, there are many messe apps and chat tools that allow emoji reactions instead of stickers.
Speedy, easy, no reply required, relaxing elements.
Emojis are essential for a soft atmosphere that is useful in modern communication!
That's why everyone uses what kind of emojis they use.
[View all images] 2021, most used emoji ranking 2021, the top 10 most used emojis around the world!
Overall, positive and bright emojis rank.
According to Unicode, the original story, 92% of the world's internet population uses emojis.
The first place is that it accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
The crying and laughing emojis in 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are very easy to use, aren't they?
When it's funny, when it's happy, of course, I did it!
I think there are not a few people who use it masochistically even when they feel like there is nothing to do with it.
Conversely, people who have never used the top 10 emojis are rare among rare.
I want you to stick to that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripherals?
* Computer farm
I've only brought it in once, but even though it's in Misato, Saitama prefecture, they don't collect it for free from Saitama prefecture.
(If it's relatively new, there is a free one)
* Inverse net
I've never used it, but it seems that Sagawa is completely free with cash on delivery shipping.
I'm thinking of using it, so if anyone knows it, I'd like to hear the reputation.
* Oversized garbage, etc. (paid), postscript > Local government collection box (small appliances free)
* Sell used.
Postscript > Mercari, Hard Off
Are there people who sell flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
Maybe it's a smart choice to sell while it becomes money
* Postscript > Lynette Japan Information provided by: /u/CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers, old UPSs, etc. that have not been picked up by anyone have become a hindrance.
It's not an oversized garbage size, so it probably doesn't cost money, but it's somehow postponed
I collect coins as a hobby
If you know how much this coin is worth, please tell me.
Coins circulating in foreign countries have no value...
Banknotes are exchanged in Japan, but coins are not exchanged
If it is a commemorative gold coin, it contains gold, so it is also worth
There are times when you don't like that guy even though he didn't do anything bad, right?
Yes, likes and dislikes are natural because we are human beings.
“I don't like something (for no reason)”, people who don't like it are like that.

I can't do it, but is she discriminated against by her face?
It's not a face, it's a heart.
But it's sad that you can decide by appearance.
I can't show the inside.
What did you do with your school athletic clothes after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I threw it away right after graduation.
Yome used to wear loungewear until they started living together lol
Is it possible for a person to become a rear charge at any time, even if they are 90 years old or over 100 years old?

If you're healthy.
Men's volleyball advanced to the final tournament for the first time in 29 years! /Men's fencing flair did not win a medal in 4th place
Ryujin Nippon is strong 8 for the first time in 29 years! Japan national volleyball team advances to the final T coach Nakagaito “It was a big goal”
I thought it would be useless when the third set was taken in the referee challenge x2, but I won the full set
The fencing men's foil team lost to the United States without winning the Japan medal
I think it was superior to the opponent until the semifinals, but why is such an opponent in the third place finals
I would like to plant a tree in my garden that will be a blindfold. Please tell me if there are any trees you would like to recommend.
As a hope, an evergreen tree that is easy to maintain, and if possible, bears fruit is good.
Thank you for your support.
To bear fruit on feijoa, it is better to plant other fruit-bearing trees nearby, such as olives, blueberries, plums, etc.
How much is each other's savings to live together so that we can live without difficulty?
It's different for each person.
It also depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better to stop living together.
There is a high possibility of breaking up.
It is better to make a matchmaker properly, hold a betrothal ceremony, go to the bridal, and have weddings and receptions.
Cohabitation has no merit.
I think it's better to stop it, but...
I went to the arcade today and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
Oh! When I thought it was a Legend Rare, it was a re-recorded Legend Rare (^_^;)
Is it possible to play games that use cards like Ganbarizing as a hobby?
I think it's ants.
