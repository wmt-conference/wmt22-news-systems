The price is more than double for orange.
What is the difference?
I couldn't figure it out by investigating it, so please let me know.
There should be only blue now.
If there is, it may be that the old product is just left.

I finally got a social security number.
After talking about the United States, I called again and again and again to make an appointment for an interview, and after a month, I called again and again and again and again and finally made an appointment. I finally got it within 2 weeks, but it took almost a month to get it.
Well, I think it was a practice for calling in English... but English on the phone is too difficult to hear
It's too papery and it's easy to break.

Because of that, I don't want to watch TV anymore...
Does that mean that artists have become impossible? TV is full of entertainers.
I saw Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there are quite a lot of scenes where the staff laughs in the back when they say something that is not particularly interesting.
It's not obviously an interesting part, but it's creepy to laugh at everything I say because I'm a selling entertainer.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, it hurts the mood of the entertainer, and it will be unpleasant for the business relationship.
Like the old black company, the industry is completely like an athletic club, and some artists' ego seem to be too big and usually have an unpleasant attitude, and if you don't do it, you will not be able to eat it.
On the other hand, there are a lot of artists themselves who say "don't lick artists" at once in the feeling that their work is difficult.
I know that the income is quite low until you start to sell, but even if someone says that a geisha is at the top of a messy job.
It can only be said that beauty of one's own career and justification for the smile entertainers being too high in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the entertainer world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry to complain.
I felt like I didn't feel good for my body if I didn't let it out like farmer...

The product ordered at the Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission
Summary: When I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, I received a wired version of the mouse and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
It's more of a mail order problem than a homemade PC topic, but I'm not convinced by any means and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It started when I found out that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (link target fish tarm) in the Tsukumo Day sale of the Tsukumo Netshop that started the previous Friday.
Since the wired version was the same price in the store, considering the possibility of a price mistake, I also checked the wired version page, and it was 5,071 yen (link to the fish truck), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received the order email normally and received the shipping email the next day
The name "CLUTCHGM41LIGHTWEIGHTWIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page.
At this point, I thought I would receive the wireless mouse I ordered, because I didn't get any mistakes or cancellation notices from the order to the shipment.
The problem was from here, and a few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in registering the product.
According to that email,
* The wireless version was sold at a special price, but it was actually a wired version.
* We have already shipped the wired mouse, so
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return only the mouse and refund
3. Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose your response
The product page for the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note say the wireless version, but it seems that I replaced it with the wired version and sent it to me without permission.
Isn't it terrible for me to send something different from the one I bought without consent and return it if I want a refund?
Even if you accept the refund in the end, please lend me your wisdom because I want to hit you with one shot

Isolated twice... Typhoon and heavy rains spilled the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple their food reserves <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture > (Fukushima TV)-Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Takachihara district of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The East Japan Typhoon in 2019 had a great impact on the lives of 8 people in 3 households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, it feels like "seriously".
The only road leading to the Takachihara area, Takachihara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, and 11 households and 30 people in the area were isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry necessary materials using the JR railway bridge, which is normally not allowed to pass.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually, a car can come to the yard, but when I get out of the car, I can carry it in my hand or carry it on my back and walk across the iron bridge to come here, so I felt the value of transportation and cars. The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until the temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and the restoration has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures based on the lessons he learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the first time, I wanted to secure something for 2-3 days." We have about three times as many foods that can be used as emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "I don't know when a disaster will come to me, so I felt once again that it is better to have a little stockpile or something else." On the other hand, the bridge was washed away and Yamatsuri Town experienced an unexpected disaster.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own efforts from 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, director of the Yamatsuri Town Education Department: "We have announced that we want to make it a day to think about disaster prevention preparations on October 12th from next year onward.
I think it's more aware than ever that unexpected things can happen."

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
What are the pitfalls of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online)-Yahoo! News
● The "Building Condition Survey" system newly established to revitalize the used housing market has been enjoying popular housing transactions.
Prices of both houses and condominiums are rising, and the reform market is also expanding.
While the Corona disaster has increased the intention to own a house, the popularity is concentrated on the properties represented by the soaring words "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station", "large-scale", and "tower", and the number of relatively cheap new properties has sharply decreased.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used in China) housing distribution in Japan is still low.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Law and started a building condition survey for the purpose of safe and secure used housing transactions and a so-called inspection survey (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/ 001219900.pdf）。
This is a system in which an architect familiar with housing checks the current situation including deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, compiles it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections benefits both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid post-delivery complaints by conducting property inspections before sales transactions, and give buyers a sense of security.
Therefore, it will also lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that can understand the condition of the used house to be purchased and can be convinced to buy, and at first glance it is a system with great merit.
However, in the current system, it is mainly the seller who takes the initiative in building condition inspections.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system is obligatory.
In other words, the real estate company in charge of brokerage is obligated to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect who conducts a building condition survey" or "we cannot", but the implementation itself is not obligatory.
On the other hand, if you look overseas, similar systems are already in place in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used market is booming.
This is a system in which the buyer asks an expert called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" to conduct a building survey before buying or selling a home.
In the United States, for example, 70-90% of used housing transactions are inspected, depending on the state.
The nature of the inspection is very different from that of the Japanese inspection, which is mainly the "seller", in that the inspection is led by the "buyer".
The seller side tries to show the condition of the building as much as possible and sell it as high and as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the investigation, make appropriate repairs, and live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the two purposes and thoughts.
Therefore, regarding the Japanese system, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern.
● The scope of the seller-led inspection set by the country is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking a really important defect.》For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) who introduced the case in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "unpleasant inspections" will be conducted, such as not reporting findings that are unfavorable to the seller.

However, mentally, I cured (?) So I was full of motivation.

It was the second time in a year, so I took a rest for about a month and broke up with the garbage company, so I thought it would be more serious than I thought and the medication wouldn't fit, so I took a long time.
Anyway, it is important to get a psychiatrist to deal with it correctly and to keep a history of hospital visits (super important).
If you have a history of going to the hospital, even if you leave the company for your own reasons, you can change it to a resignation due to the doctor's judgment at the Halowa, so the hurdles to receive unemployment insurance, etc. will be lowered.

Was Ginza an island?
5 miscellaneous studies you can talk about while silvering (LEON.JP)-Yahoo! News
"This used to be a peninsula.
The evidence..... Ginza can show you a little trivia.
Here are some Ginza knowledge that is interesting to know and will surely make you want to talk to someone.
Go over Ginza! ?
First sneak into Kinza
When you walk around Ginza, you can see eccentric place names, mysterious stone monuments, numerous shrines, and other aspects of the history of Ginza.
Walking around Ginza with my girlfriend, I suddenly visited the silence of saying "This used to be a peninsula.
Ginza used to be a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo is synonymous with the downtown area that created "XXGinza" all over Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin foundation, and in 1612, the Ginza government office, which was located in Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shin-ryogae-cho", but when it moved to Kabuka-cho, it came to be known as "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" protruding into the sea.
Before the Edo period, there was a bay from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo Maejima" extended from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now Ginza.
When Ieyasu Tokugawa established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and proceeded to develop the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu developed the block and built a moat around it to develop shipping.
He then cut down the soil from the moat and destroyed Mt. Kanda, and reclaimed the embankment.
There is a stone monument in front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo) that shows the site of the Ginza government office, which is the birthplace of Ginza, so why don't you find the one you are interested in?
A "sacred place pilgrimage in Ginza" known to those in the know
In Ginza, a "sacred place pilgriming" known to those in the know called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour" is held every year.
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most visible is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of Kabuki-za.
Many people visit the shrine at the right end of Kabuki-za before and after watching the drama.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudo son" is located on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Shusseijizoson" is located on the Ginza terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley and are not conspicuous, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to be revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Hazaemon, and "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance to the first floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
There are also places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bodhisattva are enshrined in this shrine tour, but most of the shrines use Inari as a shrine.
The "Inari shrine", which is welcomed by foxes in front of the shrine, was well established in places where there are many farmhouses, because it has the benefit of "rich harvest of rice".
In contrast to this, in big cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it has been said that there is a good profit for prosperous business, and the faith has spread even in Ginza, the most prosperous city in Japan.

Since two days ago, I went to the dentist's office because I had a sharp pain like hyperesthesia when I pushed or touched my front teeth.
The nerve was pulled and the hole was left open.
He said it was to make the pain pull faster.
Touching the teeth before the treatment will cause severe pain, but will it go away in a few days...
Painkillers don't work at all...
It will settle down in a few days.
I think it hurts the most now.
Take care of yourself.
Three days are over.
Let's write about the good things that happened recently
・Because of Corona, I didn't meet anyone, and I drink a lot of alcohol at home, and it made me happy.
・The retro game super play video that was made at the end of the year and uploaded on New Year's Day was played 5 times (smooth in the industry).
・While jogging for the first time in the new year, a security guard spoke to me when I was playing with the settings of my smartphone app in the park in the middle of the night (first conversation in the new year).

South Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy and expands overseas gas field business=South Korea report (WoW! Korea)-Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on December 12 that it has signed an agreement to acquire shares of Senex Energy in Australia and an investment agreement with HancockEnergy for the acquisition of Senex Energy.
At present, the acquisition procedure is expected to be completed in March next year, with the approval at the general shareholders meeting of Senex Energy and the approval of the local subsidiary.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) case since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International invested 50.1% and Hancock Energy invested 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided to acquire this acquisition because the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy conversion, and in the hydrogen market, natural gas-based blue hydrogen will split the market along with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Posco International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of natural gas consumption in South Korea in 2019, and local onshore gas field operations personnel in Australia.

That knee pain may be "osteoarthritis"! ?
Treatment different for different causes (MedicalDOC)-Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: I have been having knee pain recently.
What kind of disease could it be?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, osteoarthritis is the most common among Japanese people.
Editorial Department: Does that mean that the joints will be deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the joint surface is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for relieving impact and smoothing joint movement.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage may be worn or distorted.
The result is joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial department: Can osteoarthritis occur in other than the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur at the joints and bases of the fingers, the neck, the waist, the thumbs of the feet, and the hip joints.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee.
Editorial Department: What is the structure of a joint in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: A joint has two bones that are unevenly.
The part where these two faces each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the joint is surrounded by "joint capsule".
Editorial Department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In the inner layer of the joint capsule is a tissue called the synovium, which makes synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
This is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee movement."
Editorial Department: What symptoms do you get when you get osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is viscous and elastic and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly with each other.
It acts like a cushion.
However, if this is worn out or distorted, it can deform the joints and cause inflammation, resulting in pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?

3 gambling & games in the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (Real Sound)-Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series is very popular among men.
One of the great things of this work is the extreme game of life.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes me feel like ..... Challenge to cross a steel frame!
So this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's game that can actually be played or that is practiced in the planned video.
■Swamp This is the trap-full pachinko "swamp" that appeared in "Gambling Broken Kaiji".
In the original work, the high rate of 4000 yen per ball made Kaiji astonish.
This "swamp" was set up with a large trap of "nail forest", "movable jobs", and "three-stage Crune", which was almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used every trick and finally put a vinyl water tank on the building to sink the ground and tilt, which led to a great deal of wrapping.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen per ball", and the difficulty level is lowered, but you can feel the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Starside Party" held by the rich steel frame crossing as a comment, the debtors, including Kaiji, were allowed to carry out the steel frame crossing of "human horse racing".
The debtor competes for the speed of moving forward while trying to avoid falling on a thin steel frame set up 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people participate and the top two can win prizes, but there are only four steel frames, safety measures are inadequate, and the chances of death are quite high.
This steel frame crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience a very close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", the home of professional baseball and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
The Eagle Bridge has a steel-frame single bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), with "Sky Swamp" and "Victory single bridge" prepared ahead of it, and walking away.
Of course, safety measures have been taken.
Koala Koarashi, a funny entertainer, released a video of walking on the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube saying that "steel frame crossing can be experienced in Japan" and became a topic.
E-card A two-person card game, "E-card".
Use 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards, and 1 slave card, for a total of 10 cards, and play them separately for the emperor and slaves.
The game is very well done, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji fought against Tonegawa with the strict rule that "if you lose, your ears will be cut off".
After all, Kaiji realized that his ears were read by the ear-destroying device like earphones attached to his ears that detects and transmits changes in pulse and body temperature, so that he confused Tonegawa and won by cutting his ears to the limit and making the body an abnormal value.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon and other countries.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of a game with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played Kaiji in the movie, with an E-card, which attracted a lot of attention.
■Do you want to feel like Kaiji?
No one wants to be in the same situation as Kaiji, but it is also a fact that when you read a manga, you feel only about it.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A step towards the New Year, gently boosting the Tora's large ema at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine|Yamagata Shimbun
At the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema of the zodiac sign "Tora" next year has appeared.
The Tohoku University of Art and Design students visited the shrine on the 11 th, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has commissioned art and engineering students to make the original painting of the ema since the previous year.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), who was three years older than the work depicted by nine people in the Japanese painting course of the art department under the guidance of Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high in the center.
Mr. Tsuchiya said that he drew it with "an image of cherry blossoms gently pushing the back to step into the new year".
The tiger that stops and looks at the cherry blossoms has a wish that "even in a rapidly changing world, we will have time to enjoy the beauty of nature."
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in the votive tablets that are generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba (44), a Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people to overcome difficulties."

We would like to think about "Tamano, who wants to continue to live" The workshop for four high school students in the city is Sanyo Shimbun Digital
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030 ?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano who wants to continue to live".
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center", we will summarize the voices of young people and make proposals to the mayors.
"When is it fun? ".
Students answer the facilitator's questions, such as "when they get excited with many people" and "when they play the drum".
The first time held at Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13 th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed "interesting towns," "towns that are easy to live in," and "towns that make people feel worth living" using the "world cafe" method of talking while moving through "islands" with their own themes.
Each idea is written on a sticky note and pasted on imitation paper to organize it.
"A town with many young people seems interesting." "Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for livability."
We will discuss further to see if there is any commonality.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but it was charm to be able to cycle along the beach," said a third-year student at Tamano Commercial and Technical High School (18).
A third-year student at Binan High School (18) said, "There are few shops and inconvenient transportation, but a place rich in nature is good," and an adult talks about it, so he noticed not only the problems of the area but also the charm.
The second meeting in December was held only by high school students to organize the content of the recommendations.
The mayor and the superintendent of education will also be invited to make a presentation in February next year.
Rie Higashi, the director of the center, said, "I hope it will nurture high school students' love for their hometown and provide an opportunity for young people to take an active role in community development."

How to find a new way to wrap a stall (Sankei Shimbun)-Yahoo! News
It's an essential stall in winter, but don't you sometimes get a piece of cloth around your neck?
It's a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after rolling, but sometimes you hear people say that they don't know the trick at all.
If there was a stall that could be rolled up quickly and the cloth couldn't be rolled up ... I found something new.
The stall of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is more compact than general ones.
When I first saw it, I said, "Can you wind it so short? "
If you look closely, you can see that it is made of a single piece of cloth cut into strips and the whole piece is a mesh.
The edge of the stall can be passed through the mesh.
Therefore, it can be rolled up and fastened without having to tie the ends together.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular even in jackets, but many people will wear them in combination with a stole to keep their shoulders cool.
I think it would be convenient to have such a stall.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting.
It was directed by Peter Jackson called Get Buck.
It feels like life-size Beatles, and it's fresh ...
It's just before the dissolution, so it's a glitch, but it's not the dramatic glitch I imagined.
While doing my best to partition, I know I'm annoying, but come on! "It's annoying, Paul like "But come on", George with a sad feeling of "But", and John who is always calming about opinions and jokes ... The apple, who plays the role of annoying, is not so actively sandwiched and sits in the back with a face called "I'm in trouble".
They don't hate each other so much that they quarrel with each other, but there is a lot of feeling in the air that "Well, we can't work together anymore", and the Beatles feel that way, which is the disintegration of the interesting legend.
And when we started playing in that atmosphere, everyone was really talented.
They said, "How about this? The process of finishing that masterpiece while they do it from a little phrases is terrible
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing.
The scene where the casual humming humming song gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics are added is well recorded and amazing
It's not common to see the composition process like this. It's amazing.
Of course, just watching the performance scene makes me happy because everyone is on the spot.
It seems that there is still one of the three episodes, but the impression that the biggest cause of the dissolution was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them complain, but when they start writing songs, they seem to be having fun, but what about the live location? When it comes to talking about it, producers and propagant-like people say, "The Beatles are the best in the world! It was easy to understand that they had already left their own hands by saying like this.
Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so it may be that Peter Jackson feels that way...…
Also, Paul said that he is supervising it, so I thought it might be because Paul has a lot of scenes that look like bad people.

Tornadoes in the United States occur frequently, and major damage is the impact of unseasonable warmth and strong cold air (WeatherNews)-Yahoo! News
From the night of 10th (Friday) to 11th (Saturday) local time, many tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
Atmospheric conditions became very unstable due to the strong cold air moving southward at a record warmth during this period, and cumulonimbus clouds are thought to have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday 9 and Friday 10th local time has increased to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
In this record warmth, strong cold air of-30℃ or less moved southward near 5,500 m above the ground, so the active front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes are believed to have occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is originally a tornado prone area, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
The number of tornado warnings announced in a day in winter reached nearly 150, a record number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusts on Friday, 10th local time.
This shows that there are two major areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached EF3, the third strongest of the six stages, and it is believed that a gust of around 70 m/s blew instantly.
Depending on future investigations, it may be determined to be EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the improved Fujita scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale to suit the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States, has a good chance of occurring in Japan, and is at a level where wooden houses collapse.
I bought a good luck charm and want to carry it with me at all times, so I'm thinking of putting it in my wallet (although it is not a good luck charm). Is it okay to put the good luck charm as it is?
Should I fold the paper bag and put it in the paper bag I put in at the shrine?
There is no problem as it is! ("<unk> <unk> <unk> ")
Are ahamo, POVO, and LINEMO careers?
No, it is one of the major carrier rate plans.
The line used is the line itself of a large carrier.

There is also a voice for help on live broadcast from under the rubble of the American tornado "the biggest in history" (Nikkan Sports)-Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and southern parts of the United States, President Biden expressed a mysterious view on the 11th (Japan time 12 th), saying "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States.
CNN TV in the United States reported it.
Biden stressed that "We will do everything as a federal government".
I still don't know the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost."
The death toll is feared to exceed 100.
Photo] Residents carry household goods from destroyed houses in Kentucky, which was damaged by tornadoes, from the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11 th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As for the damage range of tornadoes, there is a record of 219 miles (about 350 km) that caused damage to Missouri and other places in 1925, but this time CNN's weather expert estimated that it was about 250 miles (about 400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was severely damaged, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas business battle was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of it.
In the dark, a woman stuck under about 1.5 meters of thick debris felt the weight of a rescue person searching on the rubble and asked for help on Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the woman's crying for help, the live broadcast released a screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You", which another woman seems to have sang while crying to dispel fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, hid in the basement of his 5-year-old son and home because a tornado warning was issued and was safe.
He recalled, "Many people compared it to the sound of a train, but it was a more terrifying sound like the ground sound of something spewing."
A Mayfield police officer said, "The search activity will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know if it will be weeks, months, or years."
In Illinois, a warehouse of Amazon, a major online shopping company, partially collapsed, and at least six people were confirmed dead.
Train cars were derailed due to impact so that they were cut off, and highways were also blocked one after another due to vehicle falls.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes including 130,000 in Tennessee are out of power.
I have few platelets.
What should I do to get more?

There is an old saying that the way of thinking about the star system evaluation system is different.
While other countries use 5 stars as a standard to reduce points, Japan uses 3 stars as a neutral point and points are added or deducted.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars have completely different meanings between "there is a deduction factor" and "it is not a masterpiece but a good work".
If 5 stars are used as the standard, "works with no defects" and "works of the highest standard in all" will be in the same row, so if there is such a tendency, I think it will be a system defect, which does not present the meaning of stars, but that is why such a system is currently operated. So you don't want to give it 3 stars (bad review).

Homemade radio volume
I made an am radio with my own capacitor and coil, but it was noisy and I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio sound, but I heard a radio that was different from the frequency I tuned.
It's possible that the tuning was sweet and I couldn't hear it properly, but it was different from the station I imagined.
The main topic here is that I made am radio, but it seems that I heard fm radio.

<Sakura Eating Note> "hakobune" "Fried seasonal fish caught in the sea and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce"|Living and Culture|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento "Seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried homemade tartar sauce"
Hakobune, a takeout specialty store for colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) that use plenty of vegetables.
Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year, saying, "I want you to feel like a restaurant at home".
One of the popular bento dishes is "Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
The fish is selected at the market at the best time of the year.
Takayuki says, "Fried shrimp are made as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients," and shrimp fried shrimp directly shows the plump of the texture.
There are about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli in the lunch, and rice and soup with coarse grain are added to the rice produced by Hinohikari from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are homemade in a field of soba and purchased at direct sales offices in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki is training in French style, and rapes and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, "Eat accustomed and cheerful flavor" (Yubi) like soup rolled egg is a blend of Japanese and Western dishes that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
The lunch box "hand-made hamburger of homemade snack" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, we will also sell "Charcuterie set", a processed meat product that suits wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and saw something interesting, so I tried to use it.
Ride quality is not so bad, but it shakes sometimes (not enough to get drunk
Fast, of course, slow
Safety I think it's safe because it slowed down when there were people around, and in some cases it stopped completely, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
It hurts to look around, it's good to see it, but it hurts to see it as if it was in the way.
Overall comment is not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it will be easier to use if there are a few more people or if there is consideration such as getting closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be better to make a dedicated lane so that it would not get in the way of other people walking
However, because I am relaxing, I can relax while watching the scenery, so I thought it would be a good ride if there were a few more people.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a very patient heart, with the excitement of the near future feeling that such automatic driving will become mainstream in the future and the pain of the surrounding line of sight.
Damn embarrassing.

A long family road that has rooted environmental protection activities in the peninsula of China (JBpress)-Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant, FindAsia, a Hong Kong company) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest species of mammals and the third largest species of plants.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists as well as environmental protection by local governments.
Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such region.
The sister Li's address is currently active as an actress. Xishuangbanna is an area bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities including the "Yishu" who share roots with the Thai people of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The area of Xishuangbanna (Xishuangbanna) Autonomous Prefecture Xishuangbanna is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of wild animals and 20% of plants.
This time, we met Ms. Lee, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Xishuangbanna, and told us about the activities.
Start environmental protection activities with your German husband--I heard that it has been 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the reason for that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianxu" started in 2000.
The cause is my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Xishuangbanna for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted one of the greatest biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was also lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to establish industry in this area and to produce rubber that was scarce in China, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests has been underway.
My husband was sent here from Germany to study natural resource restoration and biological resources.
Then he met me who was a reporter here and got married.
--Did you have any interest in nature protection before that?
Mr. Li, I am from Xishuangbanna, but I am not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, without that knowledge, my husband and I decided to promote the project.
I sometimes see people who are not well-faceted or particularly tall, but have an aura on them. Why do you think it is?
A popular actor said.
The aura is not something that you want to put out.
It is something that comes out naturally the moment you have confidence in yourself.
I'm sure that person has a strong self-confidence in the inside.

I suddenly think, is it fine to honor the clothes of the other person or say that they have a good color?
It's not fine, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it's very detailed.
I've never been said to be praised and detailed, so I don't know what it means.
Did you praise it in detail?
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to it?
"My heart is in full bloom in spring after being confessed by Mr. Sakura, please do this for me."
And to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to?

Separately, there is no fee, so it is recommended to open a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it as soon as you want to use it.

[Oma annex] MOD The cause of CTD in its own environment and took about one and a half months to identify it.
Until March, CTD occurred due to multiple factors while stable data did not have much time to play from around GW, and it took a very long time to identify it as I investigated it little by little only on holidays.
Why didn't you analyze the logs with the .NetScriptFramework (you'll know in a few minutes)? Some errors in the .dll series and mesh-related errors don't stay in the crash log.
<unk> The timing of the main CTD
* All papyrus, .NetScriptFramework, and logging type .dllplug-ins logs have no footprints.
* When some NPCs are killed/accumulated attacks: also triggered by console kill → improved by turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree SE update resumed version) * Is there a possibility of wetting about this?
* When camera work triggers kill move for some NPCs → Basic improvement of PC kill move setting OFF via .ini: DAR+Nemesis related setting conflict? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic outdoor) When moving in the field+some magic (e.g. freezing rune) is started, NPC hit: Dirt & Bloodv 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) all OFF and all improved in 5 consecutive attempts.
Is it due to a shader setting error in the additional armor and body mesh worn by some actors/NPCs? In addition, the SPID usage default .ini of 2.0 has a formatting error, but the result should be the intended result and the prerequisite Perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the wetting of part attacks and OnHit related motion/combat mods (.dll), but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German and French levels.
If anyone else has the same CTD problem in a Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reminder and posted it.
Everyone is doing it with the gift of mentality.
People around me don't notice it, not only colleagues but also family members.

Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home nursing-after today's home nursing
I have been receiving home nursing care for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, but I have been acquainted with the nurses (women) at the home nursing station I am using now for a long time, and I think I have a very good relationship.
I talk about many things every week.
Of course, they do what is necessary for medication management (such as package), but above all, I think today's home nursing care is how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, we talk about gender differences between men and women, or we discussed gender theory.
I also talk about the sexual desire of men and women, why she divorced, and how can I do that in home-visit nursing?
Occasionally, I wear women's clothes.
However, I have heard from my acquaintances that in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by the psychiatric hospital, an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward will come and only provide clerical support, or that an occupational therapist is coming for home-visit nursing and gives instructions from above, such as "We are doing medical care".
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think it's a really good nurse who faces Frank equally with me who has a mental illness.
By the way, she is a beautiful woman.
Some people are receiving psychiatric home care and some are thinking about receiving it.
Home nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, please take it.
And choose a good home nursing station.

Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth of China..."Delayed in the implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap" (Japanese version of the Central Japan News)-Yahoo! News
The Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, 65, 000 fuel cell vehicles will be popularized (cumulative total), and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6000 won (about 577 yen) per kilometer.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only 27% of the target (about 17,000 units).
The hydrogen station diffusion schedule for the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 stations), and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is not much different from that at the time the roadmap was announced.
The government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap was found to be much lower than the target.
On the 12 th, the Federation of Korean Economics released the report "Current Status of Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem and Policy Direction".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are almost dependent on the United States, Japan, etc.
Carbon fiber, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane is supplied by DuPont (US), Gore (US), 3M (US), etc.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative for 2014-2020).
However, the Federation of Korean Industries and Tourism said, "In fact, six countries occupy most of the world hydrogen market, and it actually means lower among competing countries."
The order of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States to become the first place.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1,033 in South Korea, which surpassed Japan (974) and ranked fourth, but it is 22% of China (4721).
The Federation of Korean Industries proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large tax credit for capital investment and research and development expenses.

I think there were many sister wives.

And in those days, I thought there were many older wives in the Meiji and Showa periods than now, because I was told that I should find my wife who was one year older than me, even if I wore gold straw sandals.

[Takasu] The town council is working on unique council reforms, such as the creation of a novel leaflet to guide the regular council to be held and the introduction of a "correspondence book" in which the townspeople evaluate the council.
The town council has not been voted for three consecutive terms, aiming to get the townspeople interested.
On the 9 th, about 1,800 new leaflets were distributed in newspapers to publicize the Sunday Congress held on the 12 th.

U.S. aid arms and ammunition arrive in Ukraine also engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp)-Yahoo! News
(CNN) U.S. Department of State officials reported that by the 12 th, equipment, including small firearms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The total amount of military aid is worth $60 million (about 6.8 billion yen), and the last piece of equipment, including four radars that identify the launch points of mortars and other weapons, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
According to U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kirby, these aids also included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin".
The purpose of military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military strengthening around the border with Ukraine.
The United States has become more cautious about the movement of Russian troops, and is consulting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to study countermeasures in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the U.S. White House on September 1 this year.
This year, the U.S. military aid to Ukraine reached about $450 million.
Since Russia's forced annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula, the total aid has surpassed $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian troops.
Last month, the National Guard of Florida in the United States was sent in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan supported by Ukraine.
U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to the U.S. Department of Defense statement.
The number of U.S. Special Forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a confidentiality matter in the execution of the operation.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges in the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The "review" of inheritance and gift tax that makes gifts "prohibited" during life, directly hit Akira Amari, the former tax adjustment chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talk with your family at the end of the year!
Gift before death and rush inheritance technique".
While the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is under discussion, the 2022 tax reform outline was overlooked, but in the near future, the royal road to inheritance tax measures, gifts, may become a "prohibition".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In addition to a direct hit to Akira Amari, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party tax council, he will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques that are suitable for the time of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department Hiroaki Miyahara)
● The "prohibition" of gifts before death that are used from wealthy people to company employees in urban areas is "From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, a full-fledged study is underway to establish a tax system that is neutral to the selection of the timing of asset transfer."
A sentence in the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year spread a great deal of turmoil not only to wealthy people but also to the middle class.
The reason for this is that the inheritance tax will be greatly increased by completely changing the rules of inheritance and making "gift before life", the royal road of inheritance tax measures, a "prohibition".
The ironclad rule of inheritance tax saving measures with high progressiveness is to "reduce the property subject to tax".
Living gifts, the strongest trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by company employees who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to their homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
The discussion of "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" that arose in such a situation is discussed.
Although the 2010 tax reform outline announced on December 10, when the fastest introduction was concerned, it was postponed, but the "review the current inheritance taxation system and the calendar year gift system" and "Gift tax exemption measures are a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit amount, so (omitted) will be constantly reviewed," etc. were put forward in more in-depth text.
In an interview with this editorial division, Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party tax system research council, said.
"It is most important to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of property transfer and to make the tax burden the same no matter when you do it.
At the bottom, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (due to integration)." If this is the fastest revision, there are only three opportunities left for gifts before death.
Even if this is not the case, it seems certain that in the near future, there will be a great deal of effort in the direction of invalidating gifts before death as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly will the rules of inheritance tax and gift tax change?

Yudai Furukawa comment drama "My Correct Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial broadcasting from January 10 th!

I hope that fans of the original work will also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

[NFL] What and how did the team players who won three passes in one game feel (BBMSports)-Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw only three passes=Patriots.
This was the fewest number of NFLs in the past 50 years since Bills recorded two passes in the third week of 1974 against the New York Jets.
The 1974 Bills had an unprecedented genius RB called O.J. Simpson who surpassed 2,000 yards for the first time in history in the previous season.
Bills overwhelmed Jets with Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton run.
The biggest reason the Patriots developed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, which is not different from Kushiro in Hokkaido in latitude.
And on that day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at a wind speed of 18 m, and it was snowing before the game.
Bills did not change their play choices very much, because they were only local.
25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's pass is 15/30,145 yards.
There was no intercept, and it was never impossible.
There were scoring machines with four red zone invasions in the 10 offense series.
Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, he went to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three times, I was able to score only three points in one FG.
Defense in front of the goal in the final stage of the game.
The Bills, who chased 4 points, committed a penalty in 3 rd& 9, and it became 3 rd& 14.
18 yards to the goal.
In 3 rd& 14, QB Allen came out of his pocket and flowed to the right, surrounded by the Patriots defense rush.
He then threw a pass at TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the right outside, ran Sharo-Akros and was free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to enter Allen's eye.
On 4th & 18, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the left outside, but the pass was hit in front of him by Patriots DB Miles Bryant and failed.
Bryant had a one-on-one cover of Bills WR Cole Beasley, but saw Allen's move on the way and released Beasley, which reacted to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw a pass at the end zone both times.
The 4th down pass may be a decisive pass, but the 3rd down did not need to aim at the TD.
You only need to play two times to take a first down.
It was still 2 minutes ago, so if I made it 4th & short, Allen's ability to have his own run was supposed to be alive.
Have a cohesive and shiny hair.

3 items that are easy to put in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR)-Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change them, you probably don't change them as often as recommended.
A 2017 study shows that kitchen sponges can breed a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (still recommended to sterilize in the microwave).
The German researchers who did this study recommend changing the sponges once a week to keep them clean.
Cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture has pointed out that the chopping board should be replaced if it starts to wear out and has scratches and grooves.
Once scratches and grooves develop, it is difficult to keep them clean and bacteria can grow.
If it's still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in a gallon of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and let it dry naturally or pat lightly with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken tableware
Disposing of your favorite mug may be heartbreaking, but the chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and bacteria.
In addition, it can cut your lips and spill your drinks at the chips.
Yes, this is a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Community market and trade are different
The community market uses steam's payment system

Trade is a function that allows you to exchange items or give them as gifts, and there is no buying and selling function.

FlashBIOS won't finish Help me
I bought the Ryzen 75800X and replaced it with the B550 I bought in September and a tomaho.
I went to the BIOS setting screen once, but after saving the settings and restarting, the black screen showed a white cursor-like point that didn't blink and was always in the receiving state.
I thought the BIOS was corrupted, and I tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't finish at all.
According to MSI's blog, it takes about 5 minutes to finish, but it doesn't finish in 1 hour.
The possible cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and I use a SD card converter.
Is the tomahoe crazy because I slept too much?
Is there any other cause like that?
Do you hate a man who is always serious?
Ah! I know you.
I always had a face like Vagabond.
He didn't hate me.

It's embarrassed to have a brand for some reason.
If it is inconspicuous, you can have it, but you can't have something like Vuitton that says Lv on a monogram.
Why?
I think it's better to have it at your length.
By the way, I think it is good in Japan.
In Japan, is .
It doesn't matter if it's Gaijin style.
You should say it early, "Why am I the only one who wants to call it away?
So it's a foreigner, so it doesn't matter, does it? If it does, you should simply say that it's unpleasant.
I don't think I dreamed that I was uncomfortable with a good chance
I used to live abroad on the way, but the Japanese who went outside, including me, came because they didn't like the Confucian traditions of the top and bottom. I mistakenly thought that they could say anything to the local people.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you are doing it with a kind of sweet or unpleasant feeling without being purely offensive.
If my friend is a Westerner, I call him under the name below, but sometimes when I speak in Japanese, I have a moment of confusion about which one to use.
Well, if it's a friend, it's still good.
Originally, I think I'm just doing it as normal, but if I ignore it, it may not be possible to stop the exception of being a gaijin, so it is better to say it now.
It's Japan, so I wonder if you can talk to me according to Japanese rules.
Edit: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always raise the glass higher than other younger people when toasting at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious, but I think it's a good habit because if you do that, you won't be mysterious about your younger and older people, or you will be treated like a Japanese.
Japanese people are fucking people (including me) who see such details regardless of their personality.

I think it is possible for people who are not native Japanese to understand the differences in the fine nuances of Japanese to reach it even if they study for a long time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, it would be better to find someone else.

It is the battle to carry out the consideration "Blade of the Oni Destruction".
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a hymn of human beings <Commemoration of the start of the anime "Yuukaku-hen" > (QJWeb Quick Japan Web)-Yahoo! News
Among the recent boys' cartoons, the "Blade of the Demon's Destruction" is particularly different in that "there is a lot of training."
It is a well-established theory that the training edition, which has no battle and trains at dawn or at dawn, is not popular among readers.
It should be known from the fact that in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat party was separated, there was training for two years, but only the touch was drawn and the rest was skipped off in a gentle way.
Well, one of the charms of one-piece walking is the eccentricity of the land, and "staying in the same place for training" may not be so compatible.
Then the training of Sumijiro, the main character of "Blade of the Destruction", was to get down to Tomioka Yoshiyu, who saved his life, and beg for the life of Nezuki who tried to take his own life. It can be said that it started from being told by Yoshiyu, "Don't let other people take the right to take and take life! ".
The weak have no rights and no choices, only they can be twisted by the strong with every power .....
While saying that, he introduced Sakonji Rakutaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Oni killing team (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intention).
The first contact between Sumijiro and Rakutaki was asked, "What will you do when your sister eats a person?"
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of narrative grass among fans.
However, taking a sister who has become a demon has the possibility that the moment of being forced to make such a judgment may come.
It can be said that it is an initiation to start training from being prepared for mind.
However, Rakutaki takes an amateur, Sumijiro, who has not yet practiced training, to Mount Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is thin and full of pitfalls and catapults and traps that will die before starting training.
Even so, it is barely a "hero correction" to sniff out the faint smell of traps set by human hands with a sharp sense of smell and somehow avoid it.
Even so, "Even so, I don't suddenly become so physically strong that I can avoid it all! " will be the essence of making Oni extinct.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become stronger without any evidence, and awakening only makes it possible to use "power and skills that have been honed up to that point" at the original potential.
"Equivalent exchange of effort," which rewards those who have made an effort, and does not rewards anything for those who have not made an effort, is a human hymn different from a demon with unfounded supernatural power, and is an unchangeable rule that is consistent with this work.
Is this old?
It is not a bed, but a way to sleep on a mat, a mattress, and a hanging futon.
Because the house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Are you greedy?
Are people who work as a part and want to work full with other stores and work together?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, it does not correspond to what I think of "game".
I think it's "greedy" to plan to get more profit than labor with the least effort.
Are there any smoking cessation clinics in the country now?

Do you think there are any Hanko shops that do not sell Shachihata?
It's in the neighborhood.

> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.

This is a little unnatural.
Hanmyo larvae ambush in the sand to catch their prey at any time, revealing only the disk-shaped head from the sand.
I think it should be.
What worries me is
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking from an ant's point of view?
Is it?
If you translate armoured heads into disk-shaped heads, I think the part of "It's a giant beast wearing helmet on the scale of ants" will disappear...

Kinnikuman Review of Oginuma X [Comics Volume 4 ] (Weekly Pre-NEWS)-Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started in Volume 3, is completed in Volume 4 !
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicts everything from the opening to the semi-finals, it is full of new devices because it focuses on only one game!
<unk> "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review Posted by Oginuma X ★★ ★ ★ (5 out of 5 stars) Superhuman wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are a book that depicts the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to keep in mind is that this is never a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
Starting from the signing ceremony, there is a lot of change in the game such as mutual restraint battle and special training scenery, but it is never boring.
This feeling of tension in the work that the battle of the century is about to start is surely connected to the reader's high tension, and even this period of time is a really calculated performance.
And before the important final, there is one more mountain, which is the third-place battle between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxury of the battle card, what I like is that in the background of the game Ramenman points to the Kinnikuman poster, "It's my turn to aim! "
And try to hit the chop.
However, Terryman who happened to pass by catches his hand blade and blocks it, glances silently, and the scene just breaks up by it.
What's great about this is that both have already lost and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a rush over the Kinnikuman.
If you can see this, you can't help but think about the activities of the distant future!
As a manga artist, I am still painful because this is what it means to have a character!
The battle between the two ends without much scaling, but the famous scene is the tears of Ramenman after the game.
Please don't just rely on the strength of your godly luck! "
The line is .
Is this a great metaphor to the work itself? I think readers have felt that Kinnikuman is the main character, so he will not lose, and that he has somehow won in a place where he is not strong.
But by having Ramenman make this comment, Yudetamago teacher himself has already told him that he can't use that hand anymore!
In one word, the readers said, "Oh, so does Kinnikuman really beat Robin?
How? "
From another writer's point of view, this is the same line that Yudetamago-sensei, who makes the work, imposes a binding on himself.
This was a great thing.
I think it is definitely one of the big points of this volume.

I was unhappy this morning...
The NAS PC is no longer powered on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
~ What happened ~
1.) Open the window for ventilation in the morning.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) After a while, when I returned to the room, I noticed that the PC made a sound like a pink rotor, and shut it down for the first time.
At this point, I thought the fan was only slowing down due to the room temperature drop (6 ° C).
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3.) No startup.
When the power button is pressed, the power light comes on for a moment and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say anything about it.
I unplug the power plug and try again, but it only works for a moment.
4.) I connected only the ATX 20 pin and 4 pin to the motherboard, removed the other parts, and tried it, but it did not start.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause, because I have heard a buzzing sound from the PSU fan hitting something before.
Try to find an extra ATX power supply in the future.
Maybe.
If not... What should I do?
Do you want to change the case and mother together...
Have you seen wild rabbits recently (within the last 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Is it surrounded by nature?
I live in the northeast.
