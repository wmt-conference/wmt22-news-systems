The orange color is more than double the price.

Please tell me because I didn't know even if I looked it up.

If so, it may just be an old product.

Was the Destiny Plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" an eight-shot against Durandal being dumped by Talia?

I don't feel like watching TV anymore because of that...
Does it mean that the artist has become unreasonable? Television is full of entertainers.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff laughed behind me even when I said something that wasn't particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's creepy to have a smirk that says, "I'm a popular entertainer, so I should laugh at everything I say."
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be spoiled, and it's probably not good for work.
Just like the black companies of the past, that industry is like a sports club, and some comedians have too big egos and usually behave in a nasty way. .
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who express the difficulty of their own work and say, "Don't underestimate comedians."
I know the income is pretty low until I can sell it, but even if I'm told that comedians are at the top of the top jobs that are difficult to work.
It sounds like justification for the glorification of one's own career and the fact that comedians have too high a position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is pretty tough, but I feel like it's getting harder and harder to get in touch with the world of comedians.
Sorry for complaining.
I felt like it's not good for my body if I don't let it out like farts...

Sample gift to purchaser
The product ordered at the Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse and received a wired version of it and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
It's a mail order problem rather than a self-made PC topic, but no matter how you think about it, it's not convincing and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It all started when I discovered that an MSI wireless gaming mouse was on sale for 3,280 yen (link Gyotaku) at the Tsukumo day sale on the Tsukumo net shop that started last Friday.
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so I checked the page for the wired version, considering the possibility of a price mistake, and it was 5,071 yen (link Gyotaku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
I received an order email and a shipping email the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page.
At this point, I thought I would receive the wireless mouse I ordered because there was no notice of error or cancellation notice between ordering and shipping.
Here is the problem, and a few hours after shipping, I got an email saying "There was a mistake in registering the product."
According to that email
* The wireless version was sold at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version
* Since we have already shipped the wired mouse,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return mouse only for refund
3. Use a wired mouse as is
choose the response of
The product pages for the wired version and the wireless version are separate, and even though the purchase history, email, and statement of delivery say the wireless version, it seems that the wired version was sent without permission.
I was sent a different product from the one I bought without my consent, and if I wanted a refund, wouldn't it be terrible to send it back to me?
Please lend me your wisdom because I want to counterattack somehow even if I finally accept a refund

Isolation twice...The only bridge leading to the district was washed away by typhoons and heavy rain Residents tripled their food stockpiles <Yamatsu Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV)-Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Takachihara District of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, it feels like 'Seriously?
I wondered if it would break down so easily, or if it would be swept away." The only road leading to the Kochihara district, the Kochihara Bridge, was swept away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 11 households and 30 residents of the district isolated. rice field.
Residents who were forced to cut off the water supply had to use the JR iron bridge, which is normally closed to traffic, to carry necessary supplies.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Usually you can drive to the garden, but if you get off the car there, you can carry it in your hand or carry it on your back and walk over the iron bridge to come here. The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rains in less than three months, and was once again isolated for several days before a temporary bridge was erected.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and restoration has progressed.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I'd like to secure enough food for two to three days." We've stocked about three times as many emergency rations, such as canned food and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, and you never know when a disaster will strike you, so I once again felt that it would be better for everyone to stockpile a little." Yamatsuri Town experienced an unexpected disaster.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town has started its own initiative from 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Manager of Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: "We have announced that we would like to make October 12th a day to think about preparing for disasters from next year onwards, setting it in the form of 'Yamari Town Disaster Prevention Day'.
More than ever before, I think I've become more aware of the possibility of unexpected things happening."

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
What are the pitfalls of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online)-Yahoo! News
● The newly established “Building Condition Survey” system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Transactions of second-hand homes are booming.
The prices of both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own homes has increased due to the corona crisis, the popularity of properties typified by soaring words such as “in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station,” “large scale,” and “tower” has increased, and relatively cheap new properties have decreased sharply. will also be affected.
[See the image in this article] However, compared to other countries, the market share of existing (used) housing in Japan remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act, and started a survey called a so-called inspection, which is a survey of building conditions for the purpose of trading safe and secure second-hand houses (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which architects who are well versed in housing check the current state of the property and the condition of the building, including deterioration, and present it to the buyer after summarizing it in a report.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because the seller can avoid complaints after delivery by conducting a property survey before the transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
It is also said that it will lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, it is a system that allows buyers to understand the condition of the second-hand house they are planning to purchase and can purchase with satisfaction.
However, due to the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative to investigate the building condition.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system was made obligatory.
In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of brokerage is obliged to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect who will conduct a building condition survey" or "cannot", but the implementation itself is not obliged. It will be.
● Risks of concern in seller-led inspections On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems have already been put in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where second-hand markets are booming.
This is a system in which a buyer asks an expert called an "inspector" or a "building surveyor" to conduct a building survey in the preliminary stage of buying and selling a house.
For example, in the United States, inspections are carried out in 70-90% of pre-owned home transactions, depending on the state.
In the sense that the “buyer” takes the lead in conducting the inspection, its nature is very different from the Japanese-style inspection where the “seller” is the main focus.
Sellers try to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it as quickly as possible at the highest possible price.
Buyers, on the other hand, want to carefully examine the contents of the survey, make appropriate repairs, and live with peace of mind.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a gap between the purposes and thoughts of both sides.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as concerns about the Japanese system.
● The scope of government-mandated vendor-initiated inspections is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects. ●For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections will be carried out in a "cowardly" manner, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

Was Ginza an island?
5 trivia you can talk about while wearing a silver bra (LEON.JP)-Yahoo! News
"This place used to be a peninsula.
It is only in Ginza that you can show off a bit of trivia, such as the proof of that.
Here are some trivia about Ginza that are interesting to know and will surely make you want to share with someone.
Going above Ginza!?
First infiltration into Kinza
As you walk through Ginza, you will find remnants of the history of Ginza everywhere, such as quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
When I was walking in Ginza with my girlfriend, I was suddenly silenced and said, "This place used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo is synonymous with downtown areas that have created "○○ Ginza" all over Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" means a mint for silver coins, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Exchange Town", but when it moved to Kakigara-cho, it came to be called "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" that protruded into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the cove and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city block and set up a moat to develop water transportation.
Then, the soil from which the moat was carved and Mt. Kanda were cut down, and the cove was reclaimed.
In addition, in front of the Tiffany Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument that says "the birthplace of Ginza", which marks the site of the Ginza government office.
Ginza's "Sacred Land Pilgrimage" known to those in the know
Every year in Ginza, a pilgrimage to sacred places called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Meguri" is held.
Among the more than 10 shrines, the most conspicuous is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabukiza Theater.
Many people visit the shrine on the right side of the Kabukiza Theater before or after watching a play.
On the other hand, “Ryukou Fudoson” is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and “Ginza Shusse Jizoson” is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
``Hodo Inari Shrine'', ``Azuma Inari Shrine'', and ``Toyoiwa Inari Shrine'' are located in the back of the alley and are not conspicuous, but ``Toyoiwa Inari Shrine'' was revered by the famous Kabuki actor Uzaemon Ichimura. The well-known "Success Inari Shrine" at the Shiseido Ginza Building 1F entrance is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places that enshrine Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bodhisattva, but most shrines enshrine Inari.
Inari shrines, where foxes welcome you in front of the main shrine, were popularly built in areas with many farmers as a blessing for a good harvest of rice.
In turn, in big cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said that it would bring prosperous business.

South Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy to expand overseas gas field business = Korean news (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on the 12th that it has signed an agreement to acquire the shares of Senex Energy in Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, there are still procedures such as the approval of Senex Energy's general meeting of shareholders and the approval of the local subsidiary, and the acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
The acquisition marks the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International will invest 50.1% and Hankook Energy will invest 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided to make this acquisition because the demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the hydrogen market with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of 2019 natural gas consumption in South Korea, as well as local onshore gas field operators in Australia. Become.

That knee pain, maybe "osteoarthritis of the knee"!?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial department: Recently, the pain in my knee continues.
What illnesses are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, osteoarthritis is the most common among Japanese people.
Editorial Department: Do you mean that the joints will be deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
Normally, the surface of joints is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, aging, obesity, and intense sports can cause the cartilage to wear out or become distorted.
As a result, joints become deformed and inflamed.
Editorial department: Does osteoarthritis develop in areas other than the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the knuckles and groin of the hands, neck, hips, big toes, and hip joints.
However, the most common cases occur in the knee and are called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editorial Department: First of all, what is the structure of a joint?
Dr. Maruyama: Joints are two bones that fit together unevenly.
And the part where these two are facing is covered with "articular cartilage", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped in "joint capsule".
Editorial Department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
The lining of the joint capsule is lined with tissue called the synovial membrane, which produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements.
Editorial department: What kind of symptoms do osteoarthritis cause?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing direct contact between bones.
In other words, it acts like a cushion.
However, if it wears out or becomes distorted, it can deform or inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you sleep in pajamas?
It's basically pajamas, but when my pajamas are being washed, I sleep in a jersey!

It seems that I should stop it somehow, and I stopped it.

3 Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series You Can Actually Experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The "Kaiji" series of gambling manga boasts explosive popularity, especially among men.
One of the real thrills of this work is the extreme game where you risk your life.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes me cringe ... ... Challenge the steel crossing!
So this time, I would like to verify the Kaiji game that can actually be played or practiced in the planning video.
■Numa This is the trap-filled Pachinko "Numa" that appeared in "Gambling Hakairoku Kaiji".
In the original, Kaiji was surprised at the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
In this "swamp", large traps such as "Forest of Nails", "Movable Roles" and "Three-Stage Croon" were set, making it almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used every possible means, and in the end, put a plastic water tank in the building and set the ground down and tilted it, making a brilliant capture.
"Numa" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko machine, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball is 4000 yen", and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you will be able to enjoy the feeling of Kaiji.
■Steel crossing At the "Star Side Party" held as entertainment by the rich, the debtors, including Kaiji, were asked to carry out the "human horse race" crossing the steel beam.
Debtors compete for speed while trying to avoid falling on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
There are 12 participants, with the top two winning prizes, but there are only four steel beams, poor safety measures, and a high chance of dying.
This steel beam crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience a very close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at "Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi", the home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. can.
This Eagle Bridge has a single steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building).
Of course, there are safety measures in place.
Comedian Koala Kogarashi became a hot topic when she posted a video of her walking across the Eagle Bridge on her YouTube, saying, "You can experience steel crossing in Japan."
■E-card "E-card" is a card game played by two players.
A total of 10 cards, 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards, and 1 slave card, are played divided into the emperor side and the slave side.
The game is very well done, with traits such as emperors being strong against citizens, citizens being strong against slaves, and slaves being strong against emperors.
In the play, Kaiji will play against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, he will have his ears cut off.
After a tough battle, Kaiji realized that the device that destroys his ears, such as earphones attached to his ears, senses changes in his pulse and body temperature and transmits them to read his mind. By making the shaved body an abnormal value, he confused Tonegawa and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and elsewhere.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru has uploaded a video of him competing with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, with an E-card, and it has become a hot topic.
■Would you like to taste Kaiji's mood?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's also true that reading the manga just makes you feel better.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A step to the New Year, a gentle boost.
At Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large votive plaque with the Chinese zodiac "Tiger" for next year has appeared.
Tohoku College of Art and Design students, who designed the design, visited the shrine on the 11th, and a ceremony was held in front of the altar.
Since the year before last, the shrine has commissioned art college students to create the original paintings for the ema.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a 3rd year student, was selected from among the nine students in the Japanese painting course of the art department supervised by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high at the center.
Tsuchiya said that he drew it with the image of "cherry blossoms gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
The image of the tiger stopping to look at the cherry blossoms expresses the wish that "Even in a rapidly changing world, there will be time to appreciate the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on votive plaques that are distributed to the general public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano who wants to continue living" To the proposal city 4 high school student workshop: Sanyo Shimbun Digital |
What will Tamano look like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are jointly working on a workshop to think about "Tamano where you want to continue living."
As part of the survey and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Mirai Zukuri Center, an intermediary support organization, we will summarize the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students answered one by one, saying, "When you get excited with a lot of people," or "When you're playing the drums."
The first meeting was held on November 13th at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
18 high school students and local residents think about "interesting towns", "easy-to-live-in towns" and "villages that make life worth living" by using the method of "world café" where they talk while moving around "islands" with different themes. .
Write each thought on a sticky note and put it on a piece of paper to organize it.
"A town with a lot of young people seems interesting."
We will discuss further to see if we have anything in common.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is attractive," said an 18-year-old third-year student of Tamano Shoko High School.
An 18-year-old third-year student at Binan High School said, "There aren't many shops and traffic is inconvenient, but it's nice to be in a place rich in nature." .
At the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to sort out the content of their proposals.
The mayor and superintendent of education are scheduled to be invited to make an announcement in February next year.
Rie Azuma, chairman of the center, said, "We hope that this will foster love for the hometown of high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to become proactively involved in community development."

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun)-Yahoo! News
Stoles are indispensable in winter, but are there times when the fabric feels loose around your neck?
After winding, it is good to look in the mirror to adjust the balance.
I was looking for a stole that I could easily wind up without feeling sluggish, and then I found something new.
The stole of the brand “COTTORI” has a long side of about 1 meter, which is more compact than general ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can you wind it so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that the fabric is cut into long strips and woven into a single piece, and the whole is a mesh.
The ends of the stole can be passed through the mesh of the net.
So you can roll and fasten without tying the ends together.
Fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular even for outerwear, but many people wear them in combination with stoles to keep their shoulders warm.
If you have a stole like this, it will surely come in handy.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's called Get Buck and was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's fresh, like a life-sized Beatles, and it's fresh...
It's just before the dissolution, so it's tight, but it's not as dramatic as I imagined.
While doing my best to organize things like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" Like John who doesn't have a lot of motivation... Ringo, who plays the role of calming down, doesn't actively interfere, and sits behind him with a "I'm in trouble" face.
We don't hate each other so much that we quarrel like that, but there's a certain feeling in the air that says, "Well, it's impossible for us to work together anymore." But it's interesting, it's like dismantling the legend
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance started, everyone was really overflowing with talent.
It's crazy the process of making "that famous song" while each other is saying "How about this?" from a little phrase
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing
The scene where the casual hum-fun-fun-like hum gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics are entered is amazingly recorded.
It's amazing because it's rare to be able to see the process of composing like this
Also, it's obvious, but everyone is so fat, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems that it's only one episode out of three, but so far I had the impression that the biggest reason for the disbandment was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of us are complaining about something, but it seems like it will be fun once we start making songs, but what about the venue for the live? When it comes to talking about producers and publicity people, they say things like, "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!" it was easy
Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising it, so I thought that might be why Paul has a lot of bad guy-like scenes.

Frequent tornadoes in the United States cause severe damage due to unseasonable warmth and strong cold weather (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, tornadoes occurred frequently, mainly in the southern United States.
It is thought that the atmosphere became extremely unstable due to the influence of the strong cold air that had been record warm for this period, and the cumulonimbus cloud developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest pushed the southern United States to record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday 9th and Friday 10th local time has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
In the midst of this record-breaking warmth, a strong cold air of -30°C or less at an altitude of 5,500m moved southward, creating an active front due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly formed along the front. Developed to
Tornadoes are believed to have occurred in the area.
The southern United States is an area prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of serious damage during this period.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during winter, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts on Friday, local time alone.
According to this, you can see that there are two concentrated areas, the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, on the EF scale (modified Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, it reached EF3, which is the third strongest out of 6 levels, and it is believed that the gust of wind of around 70m/s blew momentarily.
Depending on the future investigation, it may be judged as EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese Improved Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the improved Fujita Scale and adapted to the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which corresponds to the tornado in the United States this time, has a good possibility of occurring in Japan, and it is at the level of collapsing wooden houses.

U.S. Tornado `` Largest in History '' Voices calling for help live from under the rubble (Nikkan Sports)-Yahoo! News
Regarding tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, US President Biden said on the 11th (Japan time 12th), "One of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States," with a mysterious look.
It was reported by CNN TV.
“As a federal government, we do everything,” Biden said.
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he said.
More than 100 people are feared to have died.
From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
The damage range of tornadoes is recorded as 219 miles (about 350 km), which caused damage to Missouri and other states in 1925, but CNN meteorologists said that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400 km). He also calculated that it was the largest.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was hit hardest, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
110 people were working there at the time, but the building was destroyed and no trace left.
A woman, stuck in the dark under rubble about 1.5 meters thick, felt the weight of rescuers searching over the rubble and asked for help via a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone. rice field.
The public live broadcast included a woman screaming for help, as well as screams and another woman singing "Happy Birthday to You", apparently crying to relieve her fears.
Amber Brown, a Mayfield convenience store clerk, hid in her basement with her 5-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people liken it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying, earth-shattering sound," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police Department officer said: "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take," he continued his rescue efforts.
At least six people have been confirmed dead after an Amazon warehouse collapsed in Illinois.
Train cars have derailed due to the impact that they were separated from each other, and highways have been blocked due to the effects of cars overturning.
According to US web media, a total of about 400,000 houses, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.

It's hard to live without life insurance...
I pray that I can manage
It would be nice to be able to secure both an address and a source of income if there was a "live-in job" like a ryokan or a resort part-time job, but in the current social situation of the corona crisis, there seem to be few options.
It seems that there is such a site when I googled for the time being ↓,
Live-in part-time job / full-time job-Live-in recruitment navigation (Suminavi)
Related searches include "live-in work with translation", so many of my co-workers seem to be like that.
Bank accounts and line contracts can be managed if you have an address only for the first time, but credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards) cannot be renewed without an address (because a new card will be sent to the registered address).

There is an age-old discourse that people have different ideas about the star system's rating system.
In other countries, five stars is the standard and points are deducted from there, while Japan claims that three stars are neutral and points are added/deducted.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars has a completely different meaning between "there is a point demerit element" and "it is not a masterpiece but an honorable mention".
If you use 5 stars as a standard, ``works that have no flaws'' and ``works of the highest standard in everything'' will be on the same line, so if there is such a tendency, it is a system that does not present the meaning of the stars. I think it's a flaw above, but since that kind of operation is actually being done in that kind of system, you're saying that you don't want me to give you three stars (bad reputation).
So if you try to refute those who claim this kind of discourse with Steam's two-choice evaluation, the story doesn't mesh.

<Saga eating notes> ``hakobune'' ``Seasonal fried fish and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce'' | Living and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunch box "Seasonal fried fish and shrimp fried in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
“Hakobune” is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) that use plenty of vegetables.
Takayuki Kazuki, 39, and Yumi, 38, opened the restaurant in August last year, saying, "We want people to be able to enjoy the restaurant atmosphere at home."
One of the popular bento menus is "Seasonal deep-fried fish caught in nearby waters and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
As for the fish, I choose the best ones at the market.
“For fries, the fresh bread crumbs are applied as lightly as possible so that you can appreciate the texture of the ingredients,” says Takayuki.
The bento comes with about four kinds of side vegetables, deli, rice with mixed grains from Hinohikari from Saga Prefecture, rice with millet, and soup.
Vegetables are homemade in the soba field and purchased at direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki, who has trained in French cuisine, adds color such as rapée and ratatouille.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as "a familiar and relaxing taste" (Mr. Yumi) like dashimaki tamago.
The bento box "Hand-kneaded domestic minced meat hamburger" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the company will also release a charcuterie set of processed meat that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

There was something interesting at Haneda Airport that happened to stop by, so I tried using it
Ride comfort It's not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not enough to get drunk)
speed naturally slow
Safety When there are people around, the speed slows down, and in some cases it stops completely.
It hurts to be looked at, but it hurts to be seen like it's a nuisance
Overall Review Not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it would be easier to use if there were a little less people or if there were considerations such as having people stop by the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be better to create a dedicated lane so that it would not be a hindrance to other people walking.
However, I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little less people because it is relaxing and you can relax while looking at the scenery.
I wondered if this kind of self-driving car would become mainstream in the future, and the excitement of the near future.

If you look closely, you might be able to tell a little bit about it, but it's an eel rice bowl that doesn't use any eel.
Actually, it is "!Eggplant!"! (Tap to get the correct answer)
I love eels, but in reality, everyone just eats them with sauce, so I thought that the eel part could be anything other than how it's cooked... I thought that the texture and volume of the eel was pretty important.
I didn't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat them.
Recipe used: EGGPLANT “UNAGI” - Works of Life (I used Japanese pepper instead of green onions.

A Family's Long Road to Embed Environmental Activism in China's Frontiers (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant, Find Asia, a Hong Kong company) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists in addition to the local government's efforts to protect the environment.
Xishuangbanna, located in southwestern China, is one such area.
His younger sister Lee Wan-cha is currently active as an actress Sisapanna is an area that borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people, who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand. It is an area where
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flow here.
Sisapanna Tai Autonomous Prefecture Sisapanna covers only 0.2% of China's total area, but is home to about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, we met with Ms. Li Minguo, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisa Panna, and heard about the details of her activities.
■ Started environmental protection activities with her German husband ― ― I heard that you have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for that?
Ms. Lee Our environmental protection activity “Tianlui” started in 2000.
The catalyst was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Seesapanna for a joint UN-China scientific project.
It was the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasted great biodiversity.
At the same time, however, economic development lagged behind.
As a result, large-scale deforestation of rainforests has progressed in the past in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and research biological resources.
And then, he met me, who was a journalist, and got married.
― ― Didn't you have an interest in nature conservation before that?
Ms. Lee I am from Sisa Panna, but I had no interest in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have auras even though they are not particularly tall or well-proportioned. Why do you think that is the case?

That person must have a lot of self-confidence inside.

I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been complimented and told that I'm fine, so I don't know what you mean.
I wonder if it was a detailed praise.
What would you do if Yokomine Sakura confessed to you?
I reply, "My heart is in full bloom after Sakura-san confessed to me. Please come here."
And to date, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, is it possible to open one later?
If you open them at the same time, the process will be completed faster.
Now it will be completed in about a week.
Separately, there is no fee, so we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

[Oma Tamaki/Personal Reminder] MOD Causes CTD in your own environment, and it took about a month and a half to identify
The data was stable until March, but I didn't have much time to play from around Golden Week, and CTD due to multiple factors was occurring.
Why didn't you parse the logs with the .Net Script Framework (you'll find out in a few minutes)? Some of the .dll series and mesh-related errors do not remain in the crash log.
〇Timing of major CTDs
* Leaves no traces in logs for all papyrus, .Net Script Framework and logging type .dll plug-ins.
* When some NPCs are killed/accumulating attacks: Activated by console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ Powerofthree's SE update restart version) Improved by OFF * Is there a possibility that this is a false charge?
* During camera work for some NPC kill moves → Basic improvement by turning OFF the kill move setting by PC via .ini: Settings conflict related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic outdoor) While moving in the field + when some magic (eg, ice rune) is activated, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (upper right of MCM) all OFF and all improved after 5 consecutive trials .
Is it due to the shader setting error of the additional armor worn by some actors / NPCs and the body mesh? In addition, there is a mistake in the format of the 2.0 SPID usage default .ini, but the result is the intended result and the prerequisite Perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I made a lot of false accusations against motion/battle MODs (.dll) related to site attacks and OnHit, and focused on checking them, but the result was something like this.
I don't think there were similar bug reports, at least not at the English, German or French level.
In the unlikely event that someone has a similar CTD problem in a Japanese environment, I thought that it might be helpful as a memorandum, so I posted it.
Relatively everyone is doing it with a last-minute mentality,
People around you don't notice it, not only your colleagues but also your family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that even though he seems to be having a hard time, he is doing a good job.
But perhaps he is also just barely mental.
I didn't retire in the name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before retirement.
Thoughts on the Importance of Visiting Psychiatric Nursing - After Today's Visiting Nursing
Since I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving home-visit nursing care for a long time. I think we are building it.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they also do things that are necessary for drug administration (such as single packaging), but more than anything else, today's home visit nursing makes me realize how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness. I was.
Today we chatted about the gender difference between men and women, and even discussed gender theory.
Is it okay for home visit nurses to ask questions about sexual desire between men and women, or why she got divorced? That's what I'm talking about.
Occasionally, I am dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, there are nurses who are no longer able to work in the ward and only do clerical work, and there are occupational therapists who come for home-visit nursing. I've heard from acquaintances that they give instructions from above, saying things like, "I'm doing medical care."
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation.
By the way, you are beautiful.
Some people are receiving home-visit psychiatric nursing, and some are thinking about doing so.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
Take it if your doctor approves it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I couldn't agree with the warp, and there was a place where I canceled the contract.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patents, One-fifth of China's
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (cumulative total) will be popularized, and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The deployment schedule of hydrogen stations, which is the core infrastructure, is 38% of the target (approximately 117 stations), and the hydrogen price per kilogram is around 8,400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It turns out that the government's implementation status of the hydrogen economy roadmap is well below the target value.
The Federation of Korean Industries (Federation of Economics) released a report on the 12th, ``Hydrogen Economy and Ecosystem Current Situation and Policy Direction''.
According to the report, the reality is that most of the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fibers, which are the core materials of fuel cell vehicles, are supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane membranes by DuPont (US), Gore (US), and 3M (US).
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020 cumulative total).
However, the federation said, ``In fact, six countries occupy the majority of the world hydrogen market, which means that they are actually at the bottom among the competing countries.''
The ranking of patents by country is China, the US, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the United States to take first place, and the gap has widened.
In 2020, Korea ranked fourth with 1,033 patents registered, surpassing Japan (974), but it is only 22% of China (4,721).
The federation proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax deduction for capital investment and research and development expenses.

Do you get paid to do volunteer work?
There are idiots who mistakenly believe that volunteers must be free of charge.
There are also paid volunteers.
For example, drug trials are usually done by volunteers who get a reward.
There are many people who misunderstand that as a good part-time job.
From the Meiji era to the Showa era, were older sisters and wives in the minority compared to now?
I think there were many sister wives.
Because the word "sister wife" has come to be widely used.
In the old days, people were told to "find a wife one year older than you, even if it means wearing a gold straw sandal."

Is it a crime for a store to sell items for more than the list price?
PS5 was sold for 70,000 in stores today.
it's legal
Since it is a free competition, for example, when the scarcity value of branded items increases from the list price
For example, it is legal for a painter to become famous and have their prices go up.
The fact that the Ps5 is sold at a high price is also due to its rarity value, and the value has only increased from the list price.

Congress on Sunday?
, TV program-style leaflet creation Parliamentary reform in progress in Takasu, member's `` report card '' also: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique reforms, such as creating quirky flyers to announce regular meetings and introducing a "report card" for townspeople to evaluate councilors.
The town council election has been without votes for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
About 1,800 new flyers were distributed in newspapers on the 9th in order to publicize the Sunday assembly to be held on the 12th.
"Nama Guilon from the Morning", "Tetsuko's Room", "Jin Sawaguchi's Expedition Series"...
The town council handed out leaflets to all households on the 9th, with phrases reminiscent of the names of popular TV programs.
Hyoe Katayama, 43, who created the bill, said, "I want people to smile and go to the Diet."

U.S. aid arms and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, also engaged in troop training - CNN.co.jp
(CNN) Equipment, including firearms and ammunition, arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance program approved by President Biden, a US State Department official said by Wednesday.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (about ¥6.8 billion), and the last equipment will be shipped to Ukraine early next year, including four radars that can identify the firing points of mortars and other weapons.
Pentagon spokesman Kirby said the aid included deadly weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the Russian military's increased military strength near the border with Ukraine.
The United States has heightened its vigilance against the movements of the Russian military, and is consulting with NATO member countries to formulate countermeasures in case Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his visit to the White House on September 1.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, total aid has reached more than $2.5 billion.
U.S. forces are also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, it dispatched the Florida National Guard as part of a multinational joint training program backed by Ukraine.
US Special Operations Command in Europe also plays a major role in training and mentoring Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine was not disclosed, citing operational confidentiality.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but there was also a tense exchange in the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also threatened to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The whereabouts of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes lifetime gifts "prohibited" hits Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking with family during the year-end and New Year holidays!
Lifetime gifts and last-minute inheritance techniques".
Amid the ongoing debate on the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax, the 2022 Tax Reform Outline, which was a concern, was shelved, but in the near future, it is possible that lifetime gifts, which are the main road to inheritance tax measures, will become a "prohibited move". is big.
How will the rules of succession change?
With a direct hit to the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission, Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritances to tax saving techniques for last-minute gifts that can be made in time for the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department Hiroaki Miyahara)
● From wealthy people to urban office workers, making inter vivos gifts a "prohibited move" From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, a tax system that is neutral to the choice of the timing of asset transfers should be introduced. We will proceed with full-fledged consideration toward construction.” ― ― .
The 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year caused a great deal of turmoil not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
This is because what he is trying to say is that he intends to drastically increase inheritance tax by completely changing the rules of inheritance and making "lifetime gifts", which is the royal road to inheritance tax countermeasures, a "prohibited move".
The cardinal rule of tax-saving measures for the highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce the amount of taxable property."
The strongest trump card, lifetime gifts, has been widely used not only by wealthy people, but also by office workers who have a small amount of inheritance tax due to their homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
Under such circumstances, the discussion of "unification of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.
Although the 2010 tax reform outline announced on December 10, which had concerns about the fastest introduction, was shelved, "review the current taxation system for settlement at the time of inheritance and the calendar year gift system" and "tax exemption measures for gift tax The system does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limits, so (omission) we will constantly review it.” was launched again.
In an interview with this editorial department, Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax system research, said:
“The most important thing is to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages that depend on the time of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same regardless of the time of transfer.
Right now, I'm in the process of simulating what kind of problems (unification) will come up." If it's the fastest revision, there are only three chances left for a living gift.
Even if that is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future there will be a major shift in the direction of invalidating inter vivos gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly do inheritance and gift tax rules change?

"My Right Brother" Terrestrial broadcasting from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Righteous Brother" starring Yuta Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Kasumi Yamaya, who plays the role of the heroine Based on the manga of the same name by Morie Satoshi, serialized in Kodansha's "BE LOVE" since 2018, this work is a heartrending pure love story of a man and a woman who have a past.
Furukawa will play the main character, Kairi, and Yamaya Kasumi will play the heroine, Riyo.
Riyo, a university student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who for some reason can sleep soundly with Riyo's shoulder.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who resembles her older brother, whom she separated from at birth due to her parents' divorce.
・Comment from Yudai Furukawa The drama "My Righteous Onii-chan" will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10th!
For those who couldn't see it in FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, after knowing the development, the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Riyo, conflicts, and changes 2 I think that you can understand this work more deeply if you can see the state of people.
I hope that fans of the original will also enjoy it.
Please stay tuned!

[NFL] How did the team players who won 3 passes in 1 game feel? (BBM Sports)-Yahoo! News
Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots in this game.
It was the fewest passes in the last 50 years in the NFL since the Bills' two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
The Bills in 1974 had an unprecedented RB called OJ Simpson, who surpassed 2000 yards in the season for the first time in history in the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The weather was the biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time.
Buffalo is a town near the border with Canada, and is on the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at a speed of 18m/s, and it was snowing before the match.
The Bills, being local, didn't change their playing choices much.
25 runs for 30 passes.
Allen's passing is 15/30 for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions and it was by no means a failure.
There were scoring opportunities with 4 red zone intrusions in 10 offensive series.
Especially after the end of the 3rd quarter, he advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
It's just that I could only take 3 points of FG 1 times in the 3 times.
Goal defense at the end of the game.
Chasing four points, the Bills committed a penalty at 3rd&9, making it 3rd&14.
18 yards to goal.
In 3rd & 14th QB Allen drifted out of his pocket to the right, surrounded by a rush from the Patriots defense.
Then he threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone but missed.
On this play, ace WR Stephon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran a shallow-across and was free in front of the end zone, but Allen didn't see it.
4th & 18, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis who ran into the end zone from the outside left, but the pass was hit by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front and failed.
Bryant was covering Bills WR Cole Beasley one-on-one, but saw Allen move halfway through and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Overlooking two receivers, Allen threw passes into the end zone both times.
The 4th down pass may have been a definite hit, but the 3rd down didn't need to aim for a TD.
Get a first down in two plays.
Since it was still before the 2nd minute, Allen's ability with his own run should have come into play if he had made it 4th and short.

3 items that tend to be kept in the kitchen for a long time when it's time to throw them away and replace them (Harper's BAZAAR)-Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably your sponge that you're not changing as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges, even if they're microwaved daily, harbor a lot of bacteria (still recommended).
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
cutting board
The United States Department of Agriculture points out that cutting boards should be replaced when they begin to wear out and develop scratches or grooves.
This is because once scratches and grooves develop, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, allowing bacteria to grow.
If all else fails, be sure to sanitize frequently with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach in 1 gallon of water.
Dip the surface of the cutting board into the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and allow to air dry or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken tableware
Getting rid of your favorite mug can be heartbreaking, but chipped surfaces can become new breeding grounds for germs and germs.
Plus, the chipped part can cut your lip or spill your drink.
That's right, it's your chance to buy your new favorite mug!

Help FlashBIOS not finished
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced it with the B550 I bought in September and the Tomaho
Once I went to the BIOS setting screen, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the white cursor-like dot didn't flash on the black screen and it was in a state of being accepted all the time.
I thought that the BIOS was corrupted, so I tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to finish in about 5 minutes, but it won't finish in an hour.
The probable cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the one that converts the SD card and uses it.

For some reason, it's embarrassing to own a branded product.
If it's something that doesn't stand out, I can have it, but I can't have something with a big monogram like Louis Vuitton.
Why?
I think it's a good fit for my length.
By the way, if it's Japan, I think it's good.
If Japan. is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
You better say it early, "Why am I the only one who's been called out/talked about?"
Doesn't it matter that you're a foreigner? If it comes to that, it's better to simply say that you're uncomfortable.
I don't think I've ever dreamed of feeling uncomfortable with a decent probability
I was living abroad on the way, but the Japanese people who went outside, including myself, didn't like the Confucian customs of the top and bottom, so there were quite a few people who came, and maybe they were out of control, so they can say anything to the locals. I have misunderstood.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you're doing it purely with no malice and with a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling.
Even my friends, if they are Westerners, call them by their first names, but there are times when I get a little lost when speaking in Japanese.
Well, it's still good if we're friends.
In the beginning, it's probably just normal behavior, but if you ignore it, the exception to being treated as a gaijin might not work, so it's better to say it now.
It's Japan, so I don't want you to speak according to Japanese rules.
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized Caucasian friend always raises his glass higher than his younger peers when he toasts at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do it like that, you won't be strangely looked down upon by both younger and older people, or rather, you'll be treated like a Japanese person.
Regardless of personality, there are people (including me) who look at such details.

I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that if it's a small company, it's a person who translates well.
For non-native Japanese speakers to understand the subtle differences in Japanese nuances, I think it's a matter of whether or not they can reach it even after studying for a long period of time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, I think you should look for someone else.

Well, when I went to live alone about 3 kilometers away from my parents' house, my friend said, "If that's the case, why don't you live at your parents' house?"

Consideration "Kimetsu no Yaiba" training is a battle.
"Equivalent Exchange of Efforts" is an Anthem of Humanity <Commemorating the Start of the Anime "Yukaku-hen"> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent shonen manga, the most unusual thing about "Kimetsu no Yaiba" is that it "has a lot of training."
It has become an established theory that training arcs, in which there are generally no battles and training day in and day out, are not popular with readers.
It can be inferred from the fact that even in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, they had two years of training, but only drew the touches and skipped the rest.
Well, one of the charms of a one-piece dress is the eccentricity of the land you move around, and sometimes "staying in the same place and training" doesn't go so well.
Now, the training of Tanjiro, the main character of "Kimetsu no Yaiba", is when he kneels on the ground to Giyu Tomioka, who saved his life, and begs for Nezuko's life, who tried to take his own life. Don't let me hold you!!"
The weak have no rights or options, they can only be overpowered by the strong...
While saying that, it was Giyuu's kindness that introduced Sakonji Urokodaki, the "trainer" who trains those who want to join the Demon Slayer Corps (he is also a bad communicator who doesn't explain his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Urokodaki was when he was asked, "What would you do if your sister ate a person?"
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that's talked about among fans.
However, taking along a sister who has become a demon entails the possibility that the moment will come when such a decision will be pressed.
It can be said that it is an initiation that begins training from a mental attitude.
However, Urokodaki tells him to take Tanjiro, an untrained amateur, to Mt. Sagiri and come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air in the mountains is thin and full of pitfalls, catapults, and traps, and you'll probably die before you can start your training.
Even so, with his sharp sense of smell, he sniffs out the faint scent of traps set by humans, and barely manages to avoid it, which is the "main character correction".
Still, making Tanjiro say, "That's why I can't suddenly get high enough to avoid all of that, but!!"
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any proof, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills that they have honed up to that point" to their original potential.
The ``equivalent exchange of effort'', which rewards those who make an effort only as much as they do, and does not reward those who do not, is a human hymn that is different from demons who have supernatural powers. It is a hard-to-move rule that is consistent with
Is this old?
It's still a way to sleep, not a bed, but a mat directly in the house, a mattress, and a comforter.
My house is not an apartment.
I do too.
If you want to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon instead of a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Are you stubborn?
Is it difficult for people who work part-time and want to work full-time at other stores?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, I don't think it's "Gametsui".
Somehow, I think it's ``gametsui'' to plan to get more profit than effort with minimum effort.
Are there any non-smoking outpatients across the country now?
I do it everywhere.

It's a little unnatural here.
Tiger beetle larvae lie in wait in the sand, ready to capture prey, with only the disc-shaped head visible from the sand.
I think it should be
I'm curious
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at it from an ant's perspective?
Is not it.
If you translate armored heads as disk-shaped heads, I think that the part that says, "It's a giant beast wearing a helmet on the scale of an ant" disappears...

In an accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the trailer that was arrested and sent to prosecutors did not have a chronic disease and that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.

Oginuma X no Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) – Yahoo! News
The 20th Chojin Olympics, which started with volume 3, will be completed with this volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which drew everything from the opening to the semi-finals, it is full of new gimmicks because it focuses on only one match!
● "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer's name: Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ●Superman Pro-Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, this volume 4 is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first of all, I would like to keep in mind that it is not a volume that only depicts the match in the ring. It means no.
From the signing ceremony, to the check-in battles and special training scenes, it's a change from before, and it's hard to go to a match, but it's not boring at all.
This sense of tension that the battle of the century is about to begin gradually builds up in the work, and it definitely leads to an increase in the tension of the readers.
And before the important finals, there's one more thing you can't miss: Terryman vs. Ramenman's 3rd place match.
Aside from the extravagance as a match card, my favorite is the ramen man behind the scenes before the game, pointing at the Kinnikuman poster and saying, "From now on, it's my turn to go for it!"
and try to slam the chop.
However, Terryman, who happens to be passing by, catches and blocks the sword, silently stares at each other, and the scene ends with just that.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already lost, and there is no more opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
However, there is such a complaint about Kinnikuman.
When I see something like this, I can't help but think about his future success!
As a manga artist, I am still keenly aware of what it means to be a character!
The fight between the two ends without breaking the scale, but the famous scene is the crying appeal of the ramen man after the match.
For Kinnikuman, "Don't rely only on the strength of God's luck!"
This is the line.
I think that this is a meta-remark about the work itself, and I think the readers have had a vague impression that Kinnikuman won't lose because he's the main character after all, and that he's somehow winning in ways that aren't based on his ability.
But by making Ramenman say this, Yudetamago-sensei took the initiative and warned him that he could no longer use his hand.
With this one sentence, the reader said, "Well, then Kinnikuman is going to beat Robin with his strength?
how ? ”
The unpredictable development will stir your imagination again, and if you look at it from an artist's point of view, this is a line that Yude Tamago-sensei, who creates the work, is as good as a restraint on himself.
I thought this was a great thing.
It's definitely one of the highlights of this volume.

Winter illumination weekend held in Aobayama, Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illumination has started, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illumination that began on November 26 includes 50,000 LED light bulbs, including a 20-meter tall camphor tree, as well as walking paths and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time and was surprised to find such a place.
It was very beautiful and I was relieved," he said.
The illuminations are planned for the first time so that people can feel healing while avoiding crowds. Until December 25th, the lights are on from 5:00 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
On the last day of the festival, on the 25th, there will be a Christmas event, including a button hotpot and a movie screening.

Online distribution, agricultural and livestock product PR Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, broadcast from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities in the Okitama area and JA, developed PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce" that sells products while distributing videos on the Internet.
Yamagata Ai Bushotai and others made a remote appearance on the "Nationwide Collaboration MINATO Market TV" planned by Minato Ward, Tokyo for the first time, and delivered the charm of the region along with special products.
The opening of the store was decided due to the "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," an initiative between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, and was relayed from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Ms. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a “satoyama sommelier,” will wear a scarf from the Yonezawa textile brand “nitorito” and introduce the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
I also delivered a picture of the Imoni party with the Ai no Bushotai.
At the studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and YouTubers with over 300,000 registered users sampled Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, and more.
When I told the viewers how delicious it was, comments such as ``I can smell the smell even though it's streamed'' and ``It's great with lots of delicious things to drink'' flew around.

Unfortunately this morning...
My NAS PC won't turn on🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~what happened~
1.) Open windows in the morning for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) After a while, when I returned to my room, I noticed a pink rotor sound coming from my PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought it was just that the fan wasn't working due to the room temperature dropping (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Won't boot.
When I press the power button, the power light comes on for a moment and the fan starts, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say anything.
I unplugged the power cord and tried again, but it only turned on for a second.
4.) I tried connecting only ATX 20 pin and 4 pin to the motherboard and removing other parts, but it did not start.
5.) I suspect the PSU is the culprit because I've been hearing a humming noise from the PSU fan that seems to be hitting something.
I'll find a spare ATX power supply later and try it out.
perhaps.
If it doesn't work... what should I do?
Should I change the case and mother together?
