The application will help equip workshops. For Points Earned by Movement
Equipping the timber workshop of the Hodonín Integrated School with new hand tools. This can now be done by everyone who downloads the EPP Help with Movement app to their mobile phones.
"Your movement collects points, which are then credited to the account of our project. You don't have to be a race runner or a cyclist, the points are added even if you are walking your dog or shopping, going for a walk or walking to work," said Eva Schmidová, director of the Hodonín school. The project was among the most interesting of a huge number of other applications for the ČEZ Foundation. The application will only be active for one month.
The big return of the Czech loser is coming.
Pavel Francouz called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old fullback will be on the bench and could be in goal soon.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Plzeň or Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
In the middle of the game, he played with Vegas and has not played on an NHL rink since.
The incident occurred while the veteran goalkeeper was moving from one stick to the other.
“Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury,” the Denver unit announced in early October.
His return to the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was summoned from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his saves.
An inmate of Plzeň hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had a hip problem in his senior year and didn't catch a single game in his shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, Francik made 36 catches, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photograph of himself helping his wife Camille to put on her mask at the races.
This was reported on the BBC's website.
They send their wishes to the friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte is dressed in it.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas card on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask, helps Camille put on her mask, which matches the color of her pale dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accusation that the former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was promised one million crowns by Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He told efotbal.cz that he had access to some of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the reds and whites had not committed any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of police intercepts in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, features mainly.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then minor league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Forensics reportedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbro a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to be promised a million-dollar bribe by SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to forensics, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
Hardman has denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and we offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the intercepts, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's former dark-skinned players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR, in mid-October last year.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvps are Cold War larping.
The guns would be new, but essentially of a worse type (artillerymen had to carry cartridges by hand without cover from the armored cabin).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the lease, transport-too small, short-range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
AF: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith didn't impress the critics
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith confronts his younger version in the film. According to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is top of his game. It kills efficiently and without question. But one day he decides to put his career on hold. This, of course, displeases his employers, who will send another assassin after Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or rather his younger DNA clone. Can one determined man win a fight over himself? Literally this time.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a guarantee of quality. It is his first science fiction film, but he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six writers collaborated on the script. The most famous is David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. But according to early reviews, even all this wasn't enough for a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have the character to highlight it," says Screen Daily's Fionnuala Hannigan.
"This unsatisfactory film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summarized.
"Gemini is a case in which a tremendous amount of work has resulted in an incredibly successful action film," says Peter Deburge, Variety's reviewer.
"A confused product born of a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summarized the film in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is another's double when neither of them behaves like a human being," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
I have a story.
I got a wank right outside of town.
Nutrients were crawling out of the river, doing damage to crops, so I was there once.
As I approached, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but of course after a while the fox went.
I let her come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman was shitting himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was for a fox.
By the time I got off the perch, he was gone.
I.e. Even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has nowadays.
So in a visible place, put the expensive stuff at your feet in your sleeping bag, and you should be fine.

I.A. found respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts per respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices moving so dramatically?
Which authorities were economical?
And why did others buy more expensive?

An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature documentary Olga Špátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will have its premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karl again after ten years. I didn't hesitate a minute! Filming with a person who has lasted more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence was and is a great honour for me. I accepted the invitation to make a full-length documentary film about Karel Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first shooting day took place already on 22 October last year and the last shots with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The aim was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy with his songs to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has written himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase for the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not possible to compare my previous film Phenomenon Gott with this current one. Everyone's different. At least by filming them at a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this will be very evident in his personal, even intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed us all in what legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time that is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her narrow team in such a way that we were often carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally allowed her into our privacy, which allowed me to talk about topics quite intimate. With her husband, the cameraman Jan Malíř, she became a part of our family. We originally planned to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's jubilee. But since my family and I still had a great summer, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, since there was a lot of me in 2019, my wish was that it would be released in cinemas next spring. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself.
I respect soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of ČSLA that older generations have experienced), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that the trained can take, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, plus modern technology is getting more complex, so the ability of the reservists will rapidly lose in time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts, where they can be deployed, will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla and it is also an explicit necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic will fight only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kiko, the office has granted. But there's a catch.
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorised the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other hand - subject to the fulfilment of the structural commitments set in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesperson for the ÚOHS.
In addition to XXX Lutz, XLCEE Holding owns the Möbelix stores. If the chain Kika were also absorbed, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. It must therefore sell off part of the company being bought.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, namely Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the antitrust authorities must authorize the transaction. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from Signa Holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kiku last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is second only to the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. She faced problems when she discovered discrepancies in her accounts. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner is Möbelix. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
Only children. We don't have reproduction, but we don't have to haunt.
Some words have ominous connotations, though they only convey the state of things. They include the word "only child." It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it doesn't sound neutral. "You know, an only child," they say, with no need to add. Interestingly, the "only child" has always carried this trait, back in the days when words like demographic crisis were not widely used.
Nowadays, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the simple reproduction rate of the population is not assured by the European states. (In the West, only Israel stands out, with a combined fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. That is why it is no wonder that the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Maláčová, is also falling for him: "Only children are almost as many as two-child families," she said in an interview with LN. But she had forgotten the devil in the detail.
Yes, it is good to raise the issue instead of downplaying or ideologising it. Like in Germany, where campaigning for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "so supported by Hitler"). It's good to be reminded that many couples plan only children. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, a weak expansion of work from home discourages women from continuing to become pregnant). But despite all this, let us point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only children", there is a drop of demagogy. That statement was correct 20 years ago. Let us remember that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it dropped to a formidable 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. This is not yet sufficient for simple reproduction, so political action is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they take it down a notch.
Berlin responds to public pressure and addresses the housing crisis. Buy 6000 flats from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing units sold by the city 15 years ago from the private Luxembourg firm ADO Properties SA for €920 million ($23.8 billion). It responds to pressure from the public, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left (Die Linke) party, this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticises the move.
"The intention is to maintain stable rents in Berlin and to give tenants security," said Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the freezing of rents," he added. The Gewobag Municipal Company will take over thousands of apartments located in Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimated that the units overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation through their actions. The FDP tweeted on Friday. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party described the move as a "waste of money".
By mid-July, Gewobag had recovered 670 flats in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not disclosed by the council. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition avenue from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, the paper wrote.
The German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has become more attractive. According to AFP, rental prices have doubled over the past decade, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
We don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there are situations where you watch a dude who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago drive into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss guys and you think, "What do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they treat him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "taking on a defender" is so terrible that I find myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker has managed to play off one of his opponents.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused her! He was institutionalized.
It was nerve-racking. Allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Papa Lukas made little Ondra kneel in the corner for several hours! Besides the cameras, he said he had to suffer like this on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and said to me - Aunt, I'm only making the trouble and comments so I won't be here because I want to go to an institution," Lucie said, describing the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the studio door. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken from his family after filming and placed in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice for a month. He returned briefly to his father and his surrogate mother, Aneta (28), but then went to a diagnostic facility for troubled children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. Her biggest concern was whether we got the money. I hardly reacted at all. But then she texted me that the baby was in an institution, and then they got him back, and now he's in a diagnostic. They are both out of work," says Lucie from Plzeň.
Lightning, of course, reached out to the other side, but got only a vague response. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call me later," said Aneta, hanging up the phone.

Prague Stock Exchange grew moderately, Czech banks, O2 and Avast prospered
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with moderate growth. The PX rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45. It was driven up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and the media company CME did not fare well. This is apparent from the results of trading on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually closed with a small profit. "However, it lost just over one percent in the whole week," said Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partly corrected the declines of recent days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Shares in Avast rose 0.89 per cent to CZK 113 and O2 added 0.46 per cent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola's securities rose the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Philip Morris, a tobacco company, acquired less than a percent of the shares, which rose to CZK 13,640.
Securities of the energy firm ČEZ stagnated at CZK 520 on Thursday.
Three titles were loss-making - Erste Bank wrote down 0.87 percent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 percent to CZK 109 and VIG 0.40 percent to CZK 618.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four pennies to 25.85 CZK/EUR on the euro and three pennies to 23.62 CZK/USD on the dollar. This is apparent from the data on Patria Online.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as is well known: the omicron variant, which is most likely spreading faster than the current Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained from a previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected plus-side phenomenon has also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalizations by one third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first shipments of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is for the incoming drugs.
As stated, Merck’s molnupiravir is the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up first on the tape because the drug began to be developed long before the current pandemic to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beak has grown".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means losing your job and a media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both polled at over 20%.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables opens the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and the two winners of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the directing award and the Cannes Jury Prize and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. Also this year, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and stimulating presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The premiere of the film in Prague will be personally presented by the representatives of the two main roles of police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti also co-wrote the screenplay for the film.
Be2Can will take place this year in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art Cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
After its success at Cannes, Ladj Ly's feature debut was presented and awarded at a number of other world festivals. At the IFF Durban won the Best Film Award and Best Screenplay Award, it was also shown at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be shown in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, the audience can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Intruder, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry We Missed You, Ghost City Anthology and Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to the Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of Painted Bird.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical for the purpose of rotating units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the SSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads in its own territory, either for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads, because of the more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the whole rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on a carrier device.
Except for the museum maple, the rest are in disrepair.
In the memorial to the victims of terror, Babiš called for security cooperation
On September 27, 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial in New York City.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all the countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said so today at the New York Memorial to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honoured the memory of the two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very touching place," the Prime Minister said, as he laid a white rose at the names of Lukáš Rambousko and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová, accompanied by his wife Monica. Both were among the more than 2,750 dead claimed by the hijacked aircraft attack on the former World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The towers of the World Trade Center collapsed on impact, and in their place is now a memorial with a list of the victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The attack on the US on 11 September 2001 was cited by the Prime Minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the World Trade Center skyscrapers, the terrorists had crashed a hijacked plane into the Department of Defense building in Washington, D.C., and were planning another strike on a target in Washington, presumably the White House or Congress. This plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight in a coordinated way against international terrorism," the Czech Prime Minister added.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was a little overbearing, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everybody talked to him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was very close, he was regular, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he wore clean clothes.
He went to school in the outdoors, did all sorts of shenanigans, but he was fine, probably never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies, joined the same class, another class.
Shortly thereafter, a teacher was beaten up, police were often involved, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an advertisement (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I've sold often to Gypsies, they've always had the money, they didn't try to get me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car that way, the guy called in a month later and said he'd signed it over to him.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just common behavior).
But when someone comes in, they reach out, they empty out apartments and houses, they're just a mess, they cause trouble... no matter what color they are, I don't care.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene despite resuscitation care," spokesperson for the South Bohemian medical rescue workers Zuzana Fajtlová told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons yet to be determined, he turned in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, the accident was described by the spokesperson of the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” says the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he has to add VAT and forward data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail telling him that customs is expecting the package.
It is then sufficient to fill in the details of the consignment and, if VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will charge it on the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
Where the addressee does not carry out the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Czech Post, it is also a problem that people do not respond to requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that are needed and filled in on time, we would be about half there," says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Strict but fair, hours are fun! That's how the Benes gymnastics see their favorite teacher, the writer.
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, a prosaic and a promoter of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind over the lyrics of Pavel Hoza. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, white country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have walked them for centuries. Grieving, cursing, blessing. This contemporary Reynkův continuator teaches Czech, literature and history at the gymnasium in Benešov, operates the equivalent of the Prague Viola in the local Café na slovíčko and organizes the Benešovský literary festival every year.
Tackling inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, a raise (who is the employee)?
I got a 2% raise in gross this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run on the job.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote in the upper chamber of Canada’s parliament confirmed a familiar rumor for days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of former human rights legend, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary degree for her part in the genocide against the minority Rohingya nation.
The decision to revoke Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously endorsed it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the world," said independent Senator Ratna Omidvar. "We have to make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada—even more so as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament technically changes nothing for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary degree, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The long-time human rights activist's silence on the atrocities that the army of majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been perpetrating against the Muslim Rohingya minority for months is intolerable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar, and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens, was recently reported in a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, as the report says, "shock at both the horror of their actions and the enormity of their scale." According to the United Nations, Suu Kyi and her leadership committed complicity primarily by covering up the soldiers' actions and releasing a fog of lies around them by protecting them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation."
After the removal of Suu Kyi, five figures remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims, and Malala Yusufzai.
Developments surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy have been reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile has been updated with information about the atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of her honorary citizenship. "We've also dimmed the illumination of her picture on a tableau depicting the timeline of the fight for human rights, and we're thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," the Canadian media quotes museum spokesman Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain in Suu Kyi's current turmoil - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. "While Mrs Suu Kyi's recent actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Lars Heikensten, head of the Nobel Foundation, told CBS Canada.

Attorney General reopens prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
The Attorney General, Pavel Zeman, disagrees with the release of the mother, who has long manipulated her daughter and interfered with her relationship with her father. She was facing charges of battery and child endangerment. The district court acquitted her, but Zeman disagreed. Such conduct can be considered a criminal offence under his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ruling could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of directing further application practice," according to Zeman's appeal.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of torturing a trustee and endangering the child's education. She developed a strong symbiotic bond with her daughter, even when she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She was threatening self-harm in the event of transfer to the custody of her father.
The court in Svitavy sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. The Pardubice branch of the regional court, however, acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to rule again.
The regional court found that situations in which one parent manipulates the child against the other are not exceptional. They are dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the assistance of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only rarely is the solution criminal law.
However, according to the Attorney General, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused acted quite deliberately in stirring up negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and she purposefully reinforced those negative emotions. By acting in this way, she not only pursued the illicit intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must have been aware that she would be causing negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal reads.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to refer the case back to the regional court. The appeal states that the child is now in the custody of the father.

Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for even six months?
This just blows my mind, how can a court send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover.
Won't this also deter potential future rape reports from victims?
The first Miss Christo finally got her act together: she lost a few pounds and saw right through
The first modern miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had long years of problems with overweight, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental ones. She's suffered because she's changed a lot since Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she's taken the complaints to heart and gone into battle with the extra pounds. Even if it's a long shot.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty pageant. Not only because of her fame, but because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to follow the strict modeling rules that required her to be as slim as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and start indulging in whatever she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. The extra kilos tried to disguise themselves with various loose clothes, which added to the bulky shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana's really into herself. She had visibly lost weight, had begun to dress tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone at the launch of Miloš Zapletal's book (75) by once again seeing through the features of the lovely brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but she will also be the very first to be booed by the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava when she put on her crown.
Repairs to the Giant Mountains Museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Administration (KRNAP) has postponed the deadline for submission of bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was 20 September, said National Park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, a price we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the restoration of the museum is about a year behind schedule. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Service, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
KRNAP is failing to select a construction company for the museum repairs. The second contest was launched this summer because in the previous tender all offers of companies significantly exceeded the then expected price of 65 million. Bids exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, located in the former Augustinian monastery and owned by the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exposition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The KRNAP visitor centre should be established in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and follow up on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway for visitors to the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre should provide the most comprehensible form of information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and their protection. It should also assume the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a café.
The man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped officers secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He had summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after the 911 call, and were surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to arrive at the scene.
In fact, all he wanted from the officers was advice on how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
After checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers discovered that the woman was on a wanted list, a nationwide manhunt, and was subject to an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore being handled by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer Slavic ethnically or culturally, but I would like your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
The Unexplained Death of a Little Girl (†8) in Příbramsk: The culprit is not punished
Unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. But they, too, are investigated if new information emerges years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley in 1980, 12 years old at the time. "The 1955 case? That will be difficult, very difficult. It would take a file to start with, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really hard," Markovič says.
Under the previous regime, there was little public awareness of violent crimes, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It's always depended on specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although open cases should not be shredded.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history is a little off. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point of the ideological evolution of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are seeing rather illiberal models winning from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thriving. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he is reconsidering many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be brought back into the public domain, and Marx was right about many things. At the same time, he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the nineties, and critics of The End of History and the Last Man are said to have misunderstood.
"What I said at the time was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracies don't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, who don't see the point, and so they form groups according to identity that give them a sense of belonging."
At the time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against the Marxists, who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked how he now perceives the rise of the Socialists in Britain and the US, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, except when clear public services are in demand, I do not think that will work. But if you are referring to redistribution programs that attempt to address the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are witnessing, yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came into play, has had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation, warning all liberals that even the emergence of new, less-than-democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something without evidence just because it could potentially be beneficial.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one then choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that there's at least one god in one of those thousands of religions who will punish you badly if you believe in another.
But even in the Ten Commandments there is no god but Yahweh.
In that case, wouldn't it be more rational to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god I didn't just hit sending me to hell or some place like that?
Uncombed wants $45 million from the state.
According to Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has received six requests in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The teenager was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary finally acquitted him.
Both the Attorney General, Pavel Zeman, and the Minister of Justice, Marie Benešová, have not filed appeals in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Prosecutor's Office in Hradec charged a 20-year-old high school student, Nečesaný. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times on the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son and her life was saved by the doctors of the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed had denied any wrongdoing from the outset. "I'm innocent, and I swear it. I am sincerely sorry about what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," a young man who did not deny that he was at the hair salon on the fateful day said earlier in court. He said he wanted a haircut. He left after his wife told him she was closing. He then turned himself in as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later identified Uncombed as the assailant. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory loss after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court handed down five consecutive sentences in the case. He was convicted twice and sentenced to 16 years in prison, but the appeal court reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed, he went behind bars twice in succession, each time freed by the Supreme Court. After ordering the replacement of the bench, acquittals were finally handed down repeatedly, the last one being upheld by the High Court in March this year.
However, the Chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the grounds of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but that he did not have a better option due to the procedural situation. He said he had dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were well founded.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence has been gathered in the preparatory proceedings, which in another criminal case would be more than sufficient for the admission of guilt," Lněnička said.
But the Hradec but also the Supreme Court looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not be changed by further annulment of the acquittal.
Other: Voluntary training followed by reserve.
The Swiss model is similar, I believe.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All the forces of the ACR could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being rehashed, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of intermingling where the workforce migrates from educational institutions into employment.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is continuous, each of us constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German, or even a Mongol invader will never come here again.
​I find it funny how you see NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if we get into trouble.
Oh, my God.
One election in the U.S. that cuts their budget, and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once that they just have to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is a heavily armed army and a population that can master the military technology of its time.
And nowadays, any teenager can fly a remote control device, so I don't know what to do.
We don't need border fortifications, that's a bitch these days, but a pimply teenager behind the wheel of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
Kovosvit is selling the administration building and other halls. He expects a rainy day.
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, with consolidated turnover of CZK 1.3 billion. The main problems last year include the lack of staff and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also linked to the expected drop in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administration building, where out of the five floors it uses two, and not yet fully. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, streamline its operations. The sale of assets is not part of any current solution, be it for example cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
About half of the production is exported by Kovosvit. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, Asia to a lesser extent last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Another order in the same volume is being negotiated, which we would like to complete before the end of the year," said Kuchař. On the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit faces restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company subcontracted to Airbus. In May this year it delivered another machine, one more should be delivered at the end of the year or early in 2020.
This year's main company investment was the conversion of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average working wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and gunsmith Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company had up to 3,000 employees at the time.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's final album will be released posthumously
The album Thanks for the Dance will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. In the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the album was released at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials his father had left him. He invited a number of musicians to work with him - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck.
"When we invented music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he's still with us," said Adam Cohen. "What amazes me most about him are the reactions of those who have heard him. One by one they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his characteristic honey voice. He sang about death, knowing he would not live to see the new material released. He admitted it in an interview with The New Yorker a month before his death. "I am ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the name Plamen on 31 December by Argo.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You open your gifts under the Christmas tree, and suddenly you're home stuffed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is being re-used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This has created a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is therefore a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the shop involved (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, it also strengthens my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugstores and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Individuals and businesses together make us a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations," says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All the garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are being added to help find uses for things that would otherwise become useless waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Clean Up the Czech Republic.
Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection procedure. Circumvention of the law will be possible, opposition says
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said the chairman of the ODS MP Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics speak of tobacconists - in state-owned companies in the future. Candidates should now undergo a selection procedure at the Ministry and will be assessed by the Government's Committee for Personnel Nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection committees are to blame for the possible poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of that committee will not be binding on the Minister. The news still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
It seems wrong to me that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency over the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron’s supporters, straddling the right and left, agree on little, but they agree on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for head of state in April.
The electoral calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe,” and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticize Macron for his pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now, arguing that the Vichy regime that collaborated with Hitler during World War II was not so bad, and has had some success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of a history book seriously, and let's not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as an us-versus-them story and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But unless they had an enlightened teacher, they would never know what the larger context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he stayed on the first rung of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.

Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the final, she is missing her second title so far
In 2016, she won her first WTA tournament in Tashkent, and this year she performed very well.
After defeating Paolini, Kawa and Kuzhmova, she was ranked among the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Christine. The Belgian held her serve and broke Pliskova's serve twice in the first set. Van Uytvanck took an early 3-0 lead in the second set, and Christina failed to break even though she managed to convert a break point. In the last she turned back one match point, but in the second the end came.
Ondřej Houska's Czechs in Europe: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three NO's.
The undated picture depicts Adolf Hitler visiting a Czechoslovak border fortification. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies were involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and then faced a German attack, what would have put out the most Czechoslovak soldiers? German tanks, air force, or artillery? It might not have been one of those weapons, even though the Germans had overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses - due to blisters.
Zeman the Monument - The Man Stretching the Constitution Calls for Law Enforcement
Those who are in a divided society and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome situations where they do not have to support only their own. When he can give credit to those he otherwise criticizes. For one thing, he didn't feel like he was just following the labels he'd been assigned. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman fences during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what's going on. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of these devastated monuments - from the centers of historic cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy can come into play here, too. That if we accuse the town hall of neglecting the monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatised object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "The section of the Monuments Act allows you to fine property owners who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is unreachable, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even the critics of his constitutional-bending should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause much like the squatters he doesn't recognize. Two years ago we wrote: "Despite all the swearing, squatters draw attention to a problem beyond the current interest. To the fact that this or that structure is in a state of disrepair." And, let's face it, the President is doing the same de facto.
If you come to the historical centre of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including the houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and coinage of dollars (for Americans dollars). Why? They say it's because of the rapid sale of houses in the '90s, officials there say. But why is it that seven kilometers away the Isle, the seat of the Schliks who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has the historical core nicely repaired? It is good for the President to point these things out.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
Starting on Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, the departure time will be adjusted only, or their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services daily, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be operated daily.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections under the new timetable, the runways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be operated by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
Czech Railways will replace the carrier after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
A total of 16 services will be operated daily by RegioJet, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout works, the carrier also tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Českolipsko, where the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be replaced by the German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex trains.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how oppressed they were and they had to work, they died.
I've never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in the schools that the blacks were often sold into slavery by the blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one teaches you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, but everywhere they tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in the schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, while we're on the subject of Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they've had some good successes of their own, and I find it absurd to dismiss them.
Besides, the North wasn't much better, as a lot of people idolize it these days.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slaver, and they hated a lot of things, too.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, they lie and manipulate, and perhaps our view doesn't exist with them (there was also a TV video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires in 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found that some of the universities were appalling, the students were quite radicalised, and the schools often encouraged them to do so.
And when I imagine that these people are going to be much older one day, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's been radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, so other groups like LGBT themselves, and it leads to radicalization on the other side as well, often leading to resistance even on quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't seen anyone condemn me for colonialism or slavery either.
Rather, I encountered the wrong geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of a personal identity.
If I have anything to do with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangráce over promotion contracts
Police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangráce, over promotion contracts. Pangrác server ListNews confirmed that it took charge this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers are examining contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. According to the police, some of the money was going back to Pangrác, writes the server. Criminals were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose department CzechTourism belongs to. The investigation is continuing, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Central Against Organised Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the agency Sport Invest. The office computer was also taken from the secretary's apartment. The court search warrant for Dostálová, previously cited by ČT, stated that the minister decided in 2016, when she was a deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of the chosen persons through mediation and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not make any mistake, she can document everything and she cooperates fully with the police.
According to the agency, it was individual misconduct. Media reported earlier that he was the former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangráce, who had been dismissed due to the results of the audit. As a result, the CzechTourism agency concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I was accused. But that's all I want to say," Pangrac told the News List.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing second-generation Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen-pumping infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. Not quite standard, the customer really had to go after this car, but no one else offered such a variant at that time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years they will match the price of hybrids. Of course, this is linked to the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often used with the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, boats, trains, etc. Just those vehicles that need to cover long distances in one go. Purely battery-powered versions cannot offer that. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, Hyundai believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the hydrogen crossover Nexo.
Insects are up to 60 times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Bugs, butterflies, and other species account for more than half of life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject was published just this week, and the situation, according to her, is even more serious than humanity has realized so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As it says at the beginning of the report, insects are "ten to sixty times fewer" in the forest today. It is the decline of the entire population, not the number of species, and the research involved not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that depend on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also dwindling.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. Average air temperatures in the forest have risen two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, they say, and warming has driven the collapse of the food chain. According to the authors, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously assumed.
There was a big story about the report in the Washington Post on Monday, which headlined the new findings as hyper-alarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner told the paper, citing him as an independent expert.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "In our country the decline is also of the order of magnitude," says Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account changes in the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "It has only been running for a significantly longer time here than in Puerto Rico," Čížek adds, explaining why scientists were able to measure such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
Nokia is suing the Brno company for the name Lokia. People will not mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia objected to the Lokia trade mark application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to CCV, product confusion is unlikely.
The Brno-based CCV software developer is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the Brno warehouse management company's program is called Lokia WMS, wrote daily E15. Nokia therefore filed a notice of opposition against the Lokia trade mark application with the Industrial Property Office. CCV considers that a substitution is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers and has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a brand that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating the inventory program. The CCV designation Lokia is based on the Latin name for a type of dragonfly whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to that of storekeepers in a warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies equip their warehouse operations with, and we are not really heading into the area of mobile phone manufacturing. And we don't want to be compared to brandy, which may be missing the train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák responded in E15.
CCV applied for brand protection in August before launching the programme at the Industrial Property Office. "The protection was requested for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related business management services in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software belongs to Class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia’s objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore of course overlaps also in Classes 9, 35 and 42. 'CCV does not dispute the opposing party's claim as to the conformity of these classes of products and services. Realistically, however, they are completely different brands focused on different target groups," Ondrášek said.
According to E15, a dispute over a brand can take months and can complicate a company's business.
I'm not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some shit about the coronavirus that makes everyone ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they attend services to the Hussites because it's a lot like that in theology, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even have a Latin Mass every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. like they did in front of Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which the squad and I participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said Girl Scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing point in the parking lot.
Usually, though, the Boy Scouts take the train to Vienna to pick him up.
There is no change in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the Scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where it will be handed over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be handled by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame around the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, the Boy Scouts must comply with the measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
This is similar to last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep the intervals, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that is as safe as possible," said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Lights event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace along with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for the faithful, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will put the money to good use, but I do not understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and interferes with the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy financed/co-financed by the xy project" signs in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that's giving jobs to people, this is holding back a development where this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's gone.
Purpose defamation? Ústecká zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Not since the end of this month. The city's management attributes this to rumors that have sprung up around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav Poživil for purposefully killing the exotic animals he cared for. For example, there was a female Zambu rhino, a Kalu elephant, or a Ninja orangutan.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the city's Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said Romana Macová, the city spokesperson.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr. Cuddy had to explain the unsubstantiated suspicions. I consider it a blatant defamation of such a fine expert," she said.
There are very few specialists in exotic animals. "It's certainly not pleasant. Meanwhile, the zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "The garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of funding," explained zoo spokesperson Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He made no comment on the anonymous rumors about himself. He didn't answer his phone calls or text messages yesterday.
As far as the contract for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians believe that zero interest in it is not necessarily a fear of similar purposeful allegations as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of it. "That's the first I've heard of you. No one approached us. I think such a thing will spread quickly," he added.
Simona Krainova: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucy White!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krain posted her last naked pictures! "I was a little worried about people judging me for taking naked pictures at my age. I'm a very shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when you want to, you can still have a solid figure at 46. There's toil and austerity, of course, but there's no other way."
"Lukáš Dvořák and I took about three thousand pictures, selected about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who came to her christening very naked, told Lightning.
She was wearing a Bernhardt jacket with shorts underneath, but they were invisible, so it looked like she'd forgotten the bottom. Everyday jogging has strengthened her legs, and she can afford such models.
Simone was so pleased with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. My husband, my friends, even the Warbler Lucy the White.
I totally agree, it's horrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age gets caught in a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm moved by online ads, but then I catch myself that they've affected me, too - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always resist it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising.
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I'd ban the Internet.
There was a fire in the underground ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured.
There was a fire in the underground CSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured in the accident, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesperson for the mining company, told the Czech News Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a torrent at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, none were injured. On the spot immediately intervened the bank rescuers, who killed the fire by direct intervention and carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special committee.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-Jih mines. Mining should end in Dole Lazy this year, and the rest of the mines will be gradually phased out. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, with last year's production amounting to 4.62 million tonnes. There are 9,000 people working in the mines.
I feel that this belief has its roots in (but predominantly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion, which I'm going to say is cryptic thinking."
"I'm not going to believe everything the media says."
"I don't trust politicians."
Television has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, with 200 of them premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend for Christmas movies, presenting a record of more than two hundred to their audiences this year.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas, family and romantic films has been scoring well with audiences and increasing the audience significantly, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
This year, there were four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those pictures that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday films in reality.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, and films such as Home Alone, Love in the Sky and the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real Christmas boom did not start until 2009, when Hallmark, an American cable television station, came up with a special film series, the BBC pointed out.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter all that much, the important thing is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the past few years," Gray said.
For example, Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, resolves and the two of them kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another," Gray adds.
Mazepin had positive text on covid-19, he will not interfere in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one Formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to be attacking a better position from the 20th place he had finished in qualifying.
But Russia's Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not make it to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from the last rung and Max Verstappen first to face Lewis Hamilton in a straight title battle.
According to the Haas stable, Mazepine is relatively healthy and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all stakeholders," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
Any substitute would have to complete a qualification or a driving session at another part of the weekend.
The first competitor does not deal with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had a covid-19 at the start of the season, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
They can arrest you for that, too.
And no one will care what the boss says.
By law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhoid.
§ 152 Disease of infectious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, disqualification or forfeiture.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two years to eight years.
(c) in breach of an important obligation arising out of his employment, profession, position or office or imposed on him by law, or
(d) where such an act causes serious injury to health.
(3) Imprisonment for three years to ten years shall be punished if the offender causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) Imprisonment for five to twelve years shall be punished if the offender causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
Pike in a pond or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that, according to a recent study, our country ranks 24th in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, however, gave other, far from "rosy" figures. For example, the Czech Republic is ranked 154th in the world in speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant architectural legacy as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is documented in comparative studies, where the Czech Republic lags significantly behind the developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are being raised, people with improving living standards will also want to have a place to live, travel modern and fast, have quality cultural stands, and live free from unbearable environmental burdens.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has been years since the completion of the inner and outer circuit or the construction of a speedway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd wrangling over architectural competitions, land-use plans and building permits, but also a specific Czech conservatism that adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more daring might succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by monuments or other rather obstinate associations, or by politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the excavators.
The list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building train speedways, so Germany finally decided to lead its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by a "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes drowned in the shenanigans. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a puzzle.
Babiš came into politics promising to "arrange things". But not much has happened so far in terms of meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. An amendment to the Act on Acceleration of Transport Infrastructure Construction is in force as of 2018, but we will have to wait for larger positive impacts, such as easier land expropriation. And the new building code, approved by the government, which is said to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, take effect from 2021. A lot of people wouldn't bet on it, though.

Declaration of the end of the right in the House or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been recent reports in the media and commentaries about the upcoming coalition of the parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I am asking why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Apart from the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it makes absolutely no difference how the subjects label themselves or what the mainstream media parrot. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the party's top politicians, TOP 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party which, in its conception, ideology and voter orientation, essentially merges with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And who even labels themselves as centrist in the long run - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took everyone out of the same water? No, it is based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, free market and minimal state interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties meet this general presumption of rightism? How many salami-based laws cutting people's freedoms, raising taxes, affirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing the link to the socialist EU, or promoting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? Very, very much. Not their own labels, but their actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wing.
Coalition cooperation TOP 09, STAN and KDU I would not be surprised at all, they simply belong together on the political map, and apart from the Christian or, conversely, homosexualist and gender aspects, I do not see an obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing" and, by associating itself with these three entities, it is now openly revealing its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties refer to critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can they or do they not want to understand that there are many people who do not like Eurosocialism and growing disenfranchisement as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Aren't they hiding their utter incompetence in argument and their unreasonable or blind adoration of the Euro-Union situation?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic other than centrist politics no longer have a chance of greater success. Maybe that's the kind of connection voters really want. Perhaps they want left-of-center politics under the cover of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or even unable to identify them). I dunno. But I am not one of those voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Canoe Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Three more Czech representatives will be in Spain seeking a semi-final start in the afternoon qualifying session.
Vavřinec Hradilek failed from a strong representative group of kayakers, who received a 50-second penalty for mis-passing the goal at the beginning of the ride. Brinks and Flash, on the other hand, can relax and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal of going down to thirty on the first ride, which I did. Not that I don't care how I turned out, because Sunday starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to get a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising the well-being of the Seu. "Before the Patrol Race, I felt the worst I've felt in the 14 days we've been here. But then in the race it was good and today it was better. It's nice here all the time, nice races, the audience came, so fine," he smiled.
Flash was also satisfied. "In qualification, one doesn't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn't quite like it in the first few overs. Then I drove the middle very well, without any problems and I knew I had the mileage, so there was a second mistake when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the river. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, let's see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that on Sunday they will go to the start at the end of the semi-final block. 'I'm not a morning person, it's cold in the morning, and when you're here at eight o'clock you want a jacket and a sweatshirt,' said Pin. "Overall, the semifinals take an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference from a sleep standpoint," Flash agreed.
Of the three Czech singles canoeists only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing 20, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the upper part according to my expectations, in the middle part I felt like I wasn't making it and I wasn't going according to plan, but I managed to get into the comfortable track that I wanted to ride. I made two shots, and I'm just behind the winner in net time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals," Fišerová said.
The hunter had been injured in a fall from his perch and had been carried to the ambulance for three hours.
The unfortunate accident occurred before 7:30 p.m. in the peak areas at the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the proper equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescue workers found the hunters in a targeted location with multiple injuries. He was treated immediately and then gently but with difficulty transported on a so-called Austrian cart across the impassable terrain.
"Transport over a mile was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
Luckily, according to Radan Jaškovský, the designated chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and also the rescue worker involved, the fellow hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured man was.
"We found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Ambulance app on his phone, our rescuers would have been there sooner and at the same time the 155 dispatch office would have been immediately aware of the accident and its situation," Radan Jaškovský said.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Ambulance app activated should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Step back, he told Schiller for talking about opposition scum Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such totalitarian expression anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the Senate's proposal for a constitutional lawsuit was thrown out.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages of support for the president and messages like how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straw is being beaten. And I even dare, I don't use hard words, to quote one of them: It's opposition and senatorial scum," the finance minister said.
"With these terms the Nazis used to call citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists used to call their political opponents. It is a totalitarian rhetoric, with no respect for man or opinion," TOP 09 Vice-President Czernin wrote to the Minister, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the former First Vice-President Markéta Pekarová Adamová in the autumn.
"I was quoting one of the many reports that I received dozens of during the House proceedings. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal defamation that we see in domestic politics on a daily basis, which was also the main motive for Thursday's meeting of the House. The fact that someone refers to themselves surprises me," Schillerová told the Czech News Agency.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
The Central Bank of Venezuela is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to an order from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then pay the oil firm's suppliers in cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign-exchange reserves, which are now near their 30-year low. This was reported by Bloomberg, citing information from four sources.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian regime have largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This exacerbated the economic crisis in the country. The current crisis is one of the most serious in global terms, forcing officials to use a patchwork of different ways to move money. While Maduro’s attempt to launch a world-first state cryptocurrency has failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Central Bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA acquired its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value it owns. The company is struggling to obtain payments from customers through conventional channels because the big banks are unwilling to do business with entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of $700 million ($16.6 billion) in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not want to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, because that would require it to register on the stock exchange and submit to due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency to pay the entities PDVSA owes. Oil executives believe that the central bank is less exposed to potential obstacles to cryptocurrency payments.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralised online ledger known as the blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies due to the problems of money laundering and client information related to them and complicating compliance.
Cryptocurrencies are making a comeback this year after the 2018 debacle, thanks to expectations of greater institutional acceptance and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has made a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Tough competition for Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich gear, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. This item is left to the larger Sportage sibling, which is thus a direct response to cars such as the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear end, can vaguely recall the SUV-coupe world, especially popular in this part of the market among the premium Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz brands.
On the other hand, the XCeed can't just be placed alongside fenced versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. In contrast, the Koreans have made a lot more changes to the bodywork, so anyone who doesn't want to see Ceed in the shapes of the novelty may not even see it.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed estate, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric fourteen hundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged litre and also offers a turbocharged 1600 with 150 kW, reserved for siblings of the GT version. Don't expect a sports degree here. Turbodiesely 1.6 CRDi is offered only in mild-hybrid, i.e. the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon, the range will be expanded to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that can travel roughly six dozen kilometers on electricity alone. The batteries can then be charged from a normal socket.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater impresses!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, they never wore sweaters much at home,” confesses Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend to be washed.
And there's another problem.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as fast as I can," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If the MZ is disconnected from reality, it doesn't matter much - it gets a faulty circuit blown up and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that FB's departure from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under the influence is just unlucky).
I think it would clean up the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of 'Soviet fraternal aid' to some of our political parties and representatives would be clearer.
Then the people who vote for them would also be clearer about whose interests they really want.

Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed the two-match penalty.
Sparta appealed against the two-match penalty imposed on striker Benjamin Tetteh, who was suspended by the Disciplinary Board for his dismissal in Sunday’s derby with Slavia (0:3).
Letenský klub has posted about it on its twitter and is now waiting for the verdict of the Appeals Board.
Tetteh had already served half of his time in Wednesday's home game in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming for the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to play in Sunday’s 11-round first leg in Pilsen.
The situation of last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who was suspended for one match against Liberec by the Disciplinary Board on Thursday.
The Board of Appeal did not have time to consider the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the sentence and Falta was able to start on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The Commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week and Falta missed the following match with Zlín.
Tetteh was suspended for a foul on Glory player David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.

Spilk in pairs. In Indianapolis, after the first round, he's on the cutting edge.
After the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis, the golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of reaching the final rounds. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys and a par on the opening day of the LPGA tournament. With a score of 72, he's tied for 69th, which is the expected cut.
Spilková, 24, returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She rested because of fatigue and exhaustion from a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European LET Series is a first-year member of the LPGA Tour and so far she is not doing very well. She made the cut three times in 12 tournaments, the best being 32nd in Hawaii. He's fighting to keep his card for another season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by Korea's Hor Mizhong. After the first round, he has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over three opponents.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! Her blond hair made her young.
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even though she's celebrating her life's jubilee in November, she's never looked like a retiree. And now she helped. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
The actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had gray hair, wore seated things, and went out sporadically. She's always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can let go of her image.
Fortunately, she has not succumbed to the plastic surgery trend and takes care of her skin with a good old-fashioned indulone. And her anti-wrinkle formula is paying off. But now she's changed her hair color and seen through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only was her hair lighter and shorter, but she was dressed in a yellow jacket that made her even brighter.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even in their late seventies, they can take risks with appearances. And it paid off for Petra. She looks 50 at the most.

Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: Not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins in your wrist. If they're blue, you're the cold type, if they're green, then you're the warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, just put it on the undertone-based classification. In the next one, look at the texture.
If you are a woman with a cold undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such lipsticks. You can tell them by their tendency to orange, coral, gold, or brown highlights.
You may find that some veins look green and others look blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can focus only on your color preferences.

No more political newspapers? Critics say the new law won't help!
But, according to some opposition members, the law is more conducive to removing ministers from election responsibility while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection of posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 Members voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, KSČM, Social Democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation binding on the Minister. That didn't work out.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD fear that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind a decision of the commission and thus not have a clear transparent responsibility," thinks SPD Chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS Vice-President Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
The Governmental Committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free status, minimum age of 25, and professional competence should be the main selection criterion.
The bill will have to go through the Senate and then be signed by the President.
The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to assist Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has formally requested the assistance of NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
There are already British and Estonian soldiers on Polish territory.
Police union president Stepanek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Union of Police, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. It was announced on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the trade unions since 2005. He'll be union president for two more months. He will remain in the police force after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I submitted my written resignation to the Bureau, after which I will continue to perform my duties fully for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I've made my decision as a free man who doesn't want to be tied to a union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces and employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the Union has participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for security forces. He was also involved in a dispute with then-Interior Minister Radek John in 2011 and organised a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, Possible Reality
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "Once the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. For example, a plane could cover the distance between London and New York in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed five times the speed of sound, are complicated by engine overheating. This problem should be dealt with by Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) using super-cold helium to prevent rising temperatures.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it's a hybrid rocket and aircraft engine powered by a jet of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't evolved that much in the last 70 years, while aircraft missiles have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. Just a few infusions, Zeman joked.
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, doctors found no "sickness" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The president's doctors revealed mild signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by insufficient irrigation. "To correct the dehydration of the organism, I will take several infusions, which will get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, the director of the ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the President mentioned that Zavoral had received several hateful messages because of his medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So a brief recap: my heart is beating like a bell, my lungs are clear as if he were not a smoker, my liver is functioning as if I was a teetotaler, my kidneys are fine and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became an issue especially at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances in which Zeman has obvious walking problems. According to Prague Castle, the president is walking badly because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has low blood pressure and hearing problems. He cut back on smoking for his health.
A vacation with just a credit card? NEO account offers free ATM withdrawals worldwide!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, security, as well as the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
Travellers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying by card. This is particularly true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, don't have time to go to the exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" don't want to rely on cash to keep up. Moreover, some foreign currencies are not even available to Czech banks or exchange offices. For the NEO account, we have solved it so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.
Moreover, a credit card is a much more reliable way of not losing your money than cash. When a wallet is lost, its owner may not wait to see the money he carried in it. However, if he loses only his credit card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. They may not suffer any financial loss at all if they act quickly. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages besides its reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and management takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to EUR 100,000 and the account is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone planning to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a payment card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries around the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are travelling. They often lose any other arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all the activities that the travellers plan to undertake.
Basketballers did not reach the medal of the WOC under 17 years of age, finishing fourth
The third World Cup of Seventeen was won by the Americans, who beat Spain 77-75 in the final despite the 40 points of Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potatoes, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't hold it because we were overrun under the basket," said Captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Plzeň.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two threes and dominating the field throughout the first quarter. At that point, it seemed that the opponents would return the defeat from the group of 85:88 after overtime. But the referees gave them 15 fouls at half-time, and with questionable decisions helped Hungary return to the game with a 12-2 lead.
"I'm convinced we could have made two or three more baskets, run for 20 points, and never let go. But instead came our mistakes. I'm not interested in the referees, but in what we did wrong and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch on," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and they fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were kept in the game especially by Petra Holešínská with accurate shooting from a distance and pivotka Tereza Šípová. However, the top Czech scorer had a foul problem and was absent for a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage and gained a slight lead, which they already held, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us the first five matches were very demanding, we turned the matches in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of effort. Even against Spain, you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take them. Physically, we weren't consistent on defense. We didn't play a quick counterattack, we lacked a jump. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't combine everything together, it's hard to win," Fousek added.
He believes his charge has a promising future. "In two years the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, to be second in the European Championships of 16-year-olds and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with a good character and it is necessary to continue working with it and develop the talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," Fousek added.
The Omicron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene's looking into another kid from Adam's.
"Currently we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam's prep class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms.
No one has ever traveled abroad with suspicion of Omicron.
None of them had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had any contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of them, Ciupek said.
Head hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being examined.
There were also players from South Africa, and a Belgian player fell ill on his return.
California will restrict the sale of guns.
He wants to do the same thing as Texas on abortion.
On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit brought by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsome’s announcement responded to the US Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday that kept Texas’s abortion ban in place, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the US until roughly the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now ruling not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In fact, enforcement of the ban in this case has been made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
“If states can now block federal review of their laws, California will use that power to protect lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on a measure authorising public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This refers to homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and legal costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute, or sell assault rifles, ghost gun parts, or kits for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state did indeed reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states in her dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas ban on abortion full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are improved on the basis of the results.
For example, studies on the effects of a 4-dose dose are already pouring in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, she'll have her vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market shortly.
Leave the amount of the curative in peace.
But rethink what they're learning.
Since Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a little, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks doesn't make much sense anymore, and it's a real waste of time.
You could really cut back on that stuff.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things he would need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is an online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and I pay for the Telly Sports Package for the Spanish and English Football Leagues.
This does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 is offering the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, it would be against the law for the European Commission to use the new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland’s plan to draw €36 billion from the EU’s Recovery Fund for the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is illegally withholding funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building "impossible conditions, because its aim is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictation by blackmail and by trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states and not on a government of the strongest and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels as would result in Poland's sovereignty being curtailed.
"We will never agree to Poland being a colony," he said.
A non-confrontational homeless woman was killed under the bridge. Police are seeking witnesses.
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening and into the night of Tuesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who passed on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on Pod Krejcárkem street could have filmed the killer, for example, on a dashboard camera. A witness might just have seen him and could have described him. In short, we will welcome any testimony on this case and receive it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesperson for the Regional Police Directorate.
According to spokesman Danko, the murdered homeless woman was non-confrontational, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "Most often she was in the vicinity of Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags," Daněk added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Mahulena Bochanova breaks her year-long detox and sins again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bochanova confided in Lightning that she had given up alcohol. "During the holidays, I thought I'd give my old battered fifty-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel very rested, I have a lot of energy and mainly my psyche has improved. I haven't been mentally well lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year's abstinence was enough, and the actress found her way back to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or good wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun till morning. I've had a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also liked non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who still pairs with Petr, an entrepreneur from Brno.
Bočanová has also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will take up a new role in the series Ordination in the Rose Garden. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was oversaying. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
But knowing about it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt more than once, all I needed was cheese, parmesan, and after ten minutes on the milk shelves, I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector all the choice, less common and special cheeses were there, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to, I won't even go to the store anymore, action or no action, golden shop in the square, maybe they don't have that kind of choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and there's an order to it, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.

And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've watched data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents just a little more off the mark than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion takes place at the professional level, but only extreme views are brought into the public arena.
Wall to wall all the time.
Binary thinking: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Color cakes instead of sturdy analysis.
Comparing apples to pears.
This is how this state is, and this is how we are.
But the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states is not solved.
Ew, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the spoon and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I got a few punches on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and to the extent) is beneficial, because the child responds to it much more than words.
What's important, I think, is the warning part, because it kind of gives the kid the choice of disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not getting punished.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Former French President Chirac to be buried on Monday, public commemoration on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media are reporting this, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to bid farewell to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a memorial service at the Invalides in Paris, where the coffin containing Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
A crowd has been pouring into the presidential residence since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign a book of condolences. That will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a state of mourning.
Meanwhile, the world and France are responding further to the death of the former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as "French in the true sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, because the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the former French president's death has made the front pages of every Japanese newspaper, including the sports newspapers, the French press notes.
The Quai Branly Tribal Art Museum in Paris, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
System Defense
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, responded to a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred charter on which he is sworn and about which he has been taught in school since he was a child, or an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was decidedly in favour of the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and make them more economical with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we impose bans on politicians.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a few months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told News.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are paediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of mild supportive care.
It takes place in a clinic for childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
Children with postcovidius syndromes were in the ward, according to the doctor, continuously throughout the year.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covidal pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies of several months in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“We currently have a child of several months and adolescent age with us,” said the head doctor.
He is pleased, however, that the children's hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any deaths from the coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, in a children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus ward - it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
It also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovidius syndrome.
“Therefore, the administration of the vaccine dose is recommended in children as well,” the doctor added.
Line D will be overseen by a new subway architect, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has selected an architect to oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. From October it will become Anna Švarc, its primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but it will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport structure, travelling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
A Czech architect who participated in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, for example, won a tender launched by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other candidates participated in the tender. "The selection process included a letter of motivation and a curriculum vitae. It seems that my previous practice in London, where I worked with a team of three people to create an aesthetic manual for the subway system there, decided it," the new subway architect says. Similarly, according to her, her practice at the Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City of Prague could decide.
He does not see the Metro as just a functional transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved. However, I will not know how it will actually take place until the transport company introduces me to its ideas in the coming weeks," Švarc says.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the main aim of which is to maintain the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," says the design manual.
Whether a similar tool is a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal or whether a person can cover it, I really don't know yet," Švarc concludes.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside of the marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).

China gives the impression of a controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
Sinologist Jirouš: China gives the impression of controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for failing to stop a contagion that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help fight the coronavirus, including in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Hundreds of enslaved children have been freed from a religious school in Nigeria.
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters reported, citing the police commissioner, that there were over three hundred children aged five and above. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna Police Chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was based on a tip-off. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire over the walls. He says it's a slavery case.
Several people were arrested during the raid, according to police spokesman Jakubu Sabo, they were teachers there.
The children told the police that their parents or relatives had taken them to the school, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north," spokesman Sabo said regarding the identity of the victims. Nigeria's northern states are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal pretended to be a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freed were taken to the stadium where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided free of charge by the banks. However, the offer needs to be considered as some additional services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management is usually free of charge is straightforward. The financial houses are counting on the waived fees to be paid back someday. With the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small accounts," she says, can do almost anything that adult accounts can. The child gets his own credit card, can make payments, track account movements, has his own electronic banking at his disposal somewhere. The banks will set up the account, but it is up to parents to teach their children how to use them and to control their payments.
"Relatively flexible, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the Internet or by means of information SMS. Beware, they may no longer be free," Kuncová adds: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider the child's abilities and options."
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him mainly peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any question. In his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. And he's no stranger to tabloid cases, which he glosses over with sparkle and wit. Though this time he didn't feel like laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He had promised the singer a very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karl got sick and said it fair and square without the tabloids poking around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all appreciate Karel Gott immensely. And I wish him, of course, successful treatment and, above all, peace! The calm he needs now," Barrandov, the owner of the TV, said.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And waited for news that the Master himself would choose to give to the media. I don't much like the different expressions of what his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health. And on behalf of our media, I can say that we will only address his illness and his person if he shows an interest in it. I think the other media should consider a similar approach."
The couple wrapped the bitch in tape and drowned her in the river. The kids found the bag.
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a gift dog from one to two years old that she wanted to take care of. Her partner, ten years older, didn't like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope, and considerably eliminated its vocalizations. He put the dog in the jute bag he had tied. Together they drove the animal to the river, where it was dumped in a sack. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they found the body of a dead dog inside. They called out to a woman passing by and fled. The woman reported the incident to 911.
"Through the knowledge of the townspeople, the police have determined who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were right. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokesperson said.
Expert testimony from the veterinary field confirmed that the dog died in a clearly agonizing manner as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered within a few minutes before death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly indicate a clear intention to dispose of the animal in this reprehensible manner at all costs, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both of the previously unpunished accused could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.
Plane crash at Žinkov in Plzeň: Two people did not survive the accident
There were two people on board, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane at 8:30 p.m. requested permission to land at Chaloupka airport near Klatovy," police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová said. This was also the last record, at that time, according to the GPS coordinates, was located at Vojovice near Žinkov.
But it never made it to Klatovy Airport. A search was immediately launched for the missing aircraft that had sent the distress signal. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. There was no happy ending to the search.
In the woods near Petrovic near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from where the plane last reported, before nine o'clock in the morning, the crew of the helicopter noticed the wreckage. "We found a plane and two lifeless bodies," Korand confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, and pieces fell to the ground nearby. "We will determine the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and the staff of the Institute for the Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
The fastest man on the planet missed his tests. I'm not taking anything.
The traditionally high-profile race for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old is the world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was in jeopardy due to a case of missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without charging him for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense was backdated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to April 1, 2018, the start of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test itself until June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit the offense of three missed inspections in 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had merely forgotten to update the athletes' whereabouts in the app. "I don't do drugs or anything legal. Many athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the WOC.
His only defeat in six starts in the 100 this year came at the start of the season in the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was just six thousandths of a second ahead of compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest competitor with 9.86 is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has only done well in American university competitions so far.
The defending champion will be Justin Gatlin, a 37-year-old American who scored 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb, but only in 10.29 because he slightly injured his posterior thigh muscle.
South Africa's Akani Simbine, Rio's three-time Olympic medalist Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favorites. The fastest Jamaican, with a time of 9.96, is the 2011 World Champion Yohan Blake.
The men's 100 will begin on Friday with a preliminary round and heats. Semifinals and finals are on Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 GMT.
A friend meets a friend and says, "Hey, do you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's awesome.
The wife is happy because she eats the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the kids play with it.
That's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
Buddy: All right, high five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
Lawn trampled, giant shit everywhere, car split, kids scared of it, and wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold says: you speak ill of an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic builds an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
The Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know that she is a foreigner.
There are hundreds of doctors from abroad studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. A pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, tried to obtain some of them.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to get up early to arrive at the Motol Hospital in Prague around 5:00 p.m. A short-haired Kurdish woman flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and still treats small patients in private practice in the afternoons. He also teaches at the university.
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course for international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work.

I thought of that, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm a quibbler.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
Let me take an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for “Spanish fruit and mandarins” it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is “all American forces” including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it's already covered in the broad term, and there's no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just quibbling :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured marmoset monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before being flushed down the toilet by its callous owner and laughed at.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life, and must pay the equivalent of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, “Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will be with her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered gruesome footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her apartment on a drug charge.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing profanily.
In the next video, Holland is heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house, she found £1,600 worth of cocaine hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like, freshman year, you're gonna take the same stuff you took in sixth grade?
And it's all being killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Just take the test at 1 and then nobody cares.
Go out on the street and randomly ask people if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the absolute majority of them don't give a shit and tell you they're completely fucked.
Then what the fuck is he studying for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is, people don't want and don't need.
And at that point, it's pointless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need that particular thing.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all that stuff to stand by the machine, I was totally serious about it... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're getting to the point where not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In our country, our communist past and our persecution against the educated and the elites probably contribute to this) But the cost of having barbarians standing by the machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, the covid here would probably never have reached this size.
Marriage at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea said on Instagram in Stories, responding to inquisitive questions from curious fans about what had disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it from her social media.
Kadri and Andrea had been on edge since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move out with her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect, even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri said angrily, responding to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling, and debt.
Even his younger sister, Linda, didn't like the supposed sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife.
She decided to stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on things like that at all, and even in my family, we've never said much of those things.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't get it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I'm even more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I really wish everyone knew Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else, and we know the reality and we know the truth, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cao began his robbery in a residential parking lot, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he could think of nothing better than to climb to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
A security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the landlord woke up in the morning, he found the bananas weren't where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed the money, drunk he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
A drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business.
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right of assembly will be restricted but not abolished.

Epilepsy complicates his love of sports, surgery gives him new hope
The first time Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him was in a year and a half. He would stare into space for a few minutes at a time, immobile and unresponsive. The pediatrician therefore sent him to the pediatric neurology clinic, where after a series of examinations, doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the perfect combination of drugs to stop him from having seizures altogether. At the age of five, doctors stopped him from taking his medication, and since his seizures did not return, his parents believed that Honza was healthy and began to encourage him to play more sports. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven, he had another seizure and it all began again.
The doctors tried different drug combinations again, but this time nothing worked, the absence seizures recurring. Since he always lost consciousness during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and hurt himself. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and swapped downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboards. Although sport occasionally caused him to have a seizure, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but with a friend who kept an eye on him to help in an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the Motol University Hospital. After a series of examinations, doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a focal point from his brain, the source of his epileptic seizures. "I had to have two operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain to scan its activity, then they were able to remove the bearing. It's been a hell of a few weeks for me. I just had to lie there and hardly move, with wires sticking out of my head that were connected to a computer," recalls Honza.
The surgery was successful, and the doctors removed a relatively extensive lesion. "The first days after the surgery were very emotionally demanding, Jan was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. Compared to how he is normally alive and communicative, it was a frightening change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," the mother describes and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 attack, but according to the doctors it happens. He's been seizure-free for three months now."
This school year, Honza will be graduating, besides sports he enjoys languages and has started working with E Company, with which he goes to meetings about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is beginning to return to sport slowly. "I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so that I don't put my body under sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI canoe triathlon, where epilepsy sufferers and healthy athletes meet and which takes place this weekend on 28 September 2019 in Veselská pískovně. But next year, maybe.
What do you think would be the bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I resent how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like the 30-year-old.
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together

A French chef is suing Michelin over the withdrawal of a star. I'm depressed, he says.
The renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. He's going to sue the publisher of the Red Guide to get the exact reasons for the demotion. The Veyrat also doubts the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who he believes mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is scheduled for November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be sued because the Commissioners' conclusion was not properly substantiated. Moreover, the removal of the star took place without any warning. "I've been depressed for six months. How dare you tamper with the health of the cooks?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin allegedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as the chef putting cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I've been lovingly working with Savoy ingredients from the beginning," Veyrat protested. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin Commissioners: 'You are fraudsters who only cause controversy for commercial reasons.' The indignant Veyrat does not understand "how they could afford to say that we put cheddar in our souffle." "They insulted our region, too, and my employees went crazy. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners gather fresh herbs every morning," he said.
The distinguished chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin Commissioners and therefore asks for his restaurant to be excluded from the red guide. The publisher refuses. "If the company remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Michelin.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies to the fact that he has no meaningful charges yet, and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate them. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates rudely with us. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
The man fell upside down from twelve meters.
He survived hitting the concrete.
An incredible fall on Sunday night was survived by a man in Ostrava, who was attended by rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service.
An hour after midnight on Saturday, the Regional Operations Center responded to a distress call with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that a 27-year-old man was supposed to fall out of a window from a height of about 40 feet and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should have been, and the fire department went in.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of death.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the next care of the Ostrava trauma center, informed the spokesman of the ZZS MS of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than I am about the coronavirus, about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the disease is primarily doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Cutter.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile infection from a mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change.
In addition to West Nile, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria.
On Friday, Germany reported the first case of a human being infected with West Nile fever on German territory after being stung by an infected mosquito. DPA has been informed. So far, all the sick people have contracted the virus while traveling or through contact with sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of the disease is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute reported that a 70-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. His illness was severe and he was treated for brain inflammation in a hospital in Leipzig. He's healthy now.
The West Nile virus was first detected in Uganda in 1937. In the meantime, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and also mosquitoes, which become infected with their infected blood.
The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña has beaten legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate at lightweight, he did a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France was also victorious, beating Cody Garbrandt by a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight contest between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary dwarf, for Nunes had not lost in seven years, and she was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to knock her down.
Peña, however, did not allow herself to be forced into any more errors and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with the hand lever.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both combatants landed a number of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Plus, Peña got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
She had to give up the effort and knock it off.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier was better off, but gradually the tide began to turn.
In the other, Oliveira tried to be more active, trying to beat his opponent with a hand lever.
He didn't do that very well, but then he built up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and hit him with a series of blows.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to beat the choke.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a brilliant victory against Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then beat him with a series of well-aimed punches and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes had another triumph with her little daughter, and now, after seven years, she had lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical genus, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are male, female or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns with which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two houses.
They then take on dual terminals during declension and in some cases remain in the non-inclined form.
For example, the words "wriggle" or "hip" are of both male and female gender, in the former they are slanted according to the pattern "machine", in the latter they are slanted according to the pattern "song".
For the other group of nouns, the shapes are already different in the first instance of the singular, for example: ‘row/row’, ‘kohlrabi/kohlrabi’ or ‘potato/potato’ (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-scriptural, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "doughnut" and "doughnut" etc.
Some of the words that came into Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but they gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained rigid in the middle genus, but has endings in the male genus along the lines of "castle".
Civilization in Borrowed Time
I recently recalled a beautiful "line" from one of the great stories of Šimka and Grossmann, set partly in a cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she cries well, but on a stranger's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They act as if the planet Earth is ruled by humans. In fact, we're just a speck on her surface that she can blow out like a gust of wind, a candle flame. Probably not many of them watch the famous British and American nature documentaries about the destructive powers of our blue ball. After all, all it would take is for one of the larger active volcanoes to "fart" and our advanced civilization to poop.
And that it will happen in the immediate future is highly likely. In the opinion of leading volcanologists, many large volcanoes are "charged and armed" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any very angry volcano, along with dust and toxic volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more into the atmosphere than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
So violently curbing CO2 production makes no sense. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. Possible warming is much more favourable for mankind than, for example, a rapid return of the Ice Age.
Recognizing the hitherto insufficiently studied impact of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one sensible conclusion: Let us strive to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us adapt to other changes, which we cannot measure with force, at the least cost!

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way towards the southern borders of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what is the situation on the ground?
Coal will give way to gas and the core. Renewables will not meet increased demand, says ExxonMobil boss in Europe
Renewables will not be enough to satisfy the Czech Republic's future energy demand. Due to the unfavourable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be complemented by other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says so in an interview with HN. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories to store the unused energy from days when the sun and wind are plentiful are still too expensive.
In Prague, Ducom visited the ExxonMobil Center, which employs 1,200 people and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company's operations.
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we choked, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has faced for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent the drastic fallout, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been, and they're pretty rare.
That's why everyone's always written about everywhere.
It's unpleasant for people to have to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to avoid it.
I don't personally know anyone who's been framed.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how those people are often treated by their neighbors or even by the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
The trend has been for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the allegations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend," you're only helping sex offenders.
Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China prepares celebrations at massacre site
The army has been practicing the parade on recent weekends. Shops in downtown Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military vehicles rolled across the empty streets toward the plaza, combat aircraft circling in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country would display its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would unsettle other states.
She was apparently referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up. But they may also be worried in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against China’s appointed governor.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The South China port of Xiamen put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is located opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of China's ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, there's a growing list of forbidden items. Already there are drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave devices, the Guardian pointed out. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo deletes "harmful political information".
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party is staying (at the oar) despite all predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who deals with China. "This is the moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 when the Communists under Mao Zedong won a battle with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democratic demonstrators, both students and workers, in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of both communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Czech Republic floods with unfinished houses, families have no money to finish
Prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
It put a lot of people in a tough spot.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished houses and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
As a result, people do not have enough money to complete already-under-construction family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move into unfinished houses.
In a worse case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three single-family houses in a year, and fifty percent of us do.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earnings," said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of the construction company.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they had expected the house to cost them five million, now it would cost them seven.
I think some of them will be waiting," Sullivan added.
Copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic lacks graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
“The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said Křeček.
We're good, and we're gonna be even better.
But there is no real vision, says ČRO commentator – myRozhlas
Beyond the traditional celebrations, the entrance to the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and ANO President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
The Ministry plans a lump sum from 2021. Nothing changes tax-wise.
The MoF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, i.e. about one million people who do not receive meal vouchers, will also be able to support meals.
However, according to the Chairman of the Voucher System Operators Association, David Rýc, many small companies that do not have canteens or meal vouchers provide meals to their employees, for example by importing food or by agreeing with restaurants.
"The point of the plan is that we don't change anything about the tax advantage. It will no longer pay for health and social insurance," Schillerová said on Friday. It added that the ceiling for the maximum employer’s contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal ticket price. The remainder is paid by the employee, and in some cases by the employer, but without the tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal ticket for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
As in, I find my thesis cool right now, I have my own topic that I've chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a year, and then in a week or two I write a written part.
Statehouses are very quiet in our country, unless you're a total maverick and you've got something left in your head, the committee won't stifle you with a theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the State Department, and when I was at my wit's end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical inference, which I immediately realized, and I got it right.
Anyway, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's cool if at the end of the course there's an exam that reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
The tuner brought the voice of the digital soul.
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, says the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative explanation, it says that for decades the medical community ignored the facts about obesity and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people that not only marked public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes says right from the start is that from knowing and knowing the facts to putting them into practice there is often a very long and tedious journey. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains in the seventeenth century gave their crew lemons, limes, and oranges in the belief that they would prevent the disease. However, the British Navy withdrew from this practice due to concerns about increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in preventing and treating the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but they did not become mandatory until the 1960s, just as the first confirmed asbestos-related death dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - no matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.
Obesity, meanwhile, is viewed as an eminently personal failure of an individual who is claimed to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of being fat is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they do on computer games and movies. But the truth is, diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95% to 98% of attempts to lose weight ended in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gained more weight than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic, where, for example, only 19 hours of the entire study are devoted to nutrition issues in the faculties when teaching future doctors. Which at a time when the 60 process of calories that Americans take in comes from ultra-processed food - that is, too processed food.
And how obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people tend to have shorter checkups, with less empathy from doctors, who view them as more problematic patients.
But overweight is far from being an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, obesity rates have doubled in 73 countries around the world, and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has succeeded in reducing and stopping this increase. None whatsoever.
But don't overload your e-mails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy may not have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along, or something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Pooh Bear statue.
You need to put it in such a way that it touches Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta is giving artists a hard time.
If you don't give the stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the bare minimum.
Plus, they keep changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It's pissed me off lately, so I might have to stoop to the tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my line of work have been successful and they're not even close to letting it happen.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly to come along that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement by the Workers' Party in Donbas
The Union - yes, broken - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the Belovezhsky Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open and lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that “the Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With a stroke of a pen, they “abolished” a vast country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Earlier, the same people who had destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years in a single session in the White Forest had betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, put the brakes on agriculture, ripped off fourteen republics from the world's greatest power that had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's eastward expansion, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "power vacuum."
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken today, mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
D5 crash: Motorway closed by truck collision
The event was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight. Passenger cars can go through a gas station," police spokesperson Michaela Richter said this morning. Traffic was restored around 14:30. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.
Petr Svoboda, spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire department, said that one truck carried passenger vehicles and the other a plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were shifted and had to be secured by the fire brigade against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank that leaked about 200 liters of diesel. Another 200 liters were drained by the fire department. Workers from the environmental department of Beroun City Hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the clearing of the highway was secured by a private company, which also extracted the contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not be directly correlated with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK/kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit about how if something's cheap, it's guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or poor is very retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
The Germans have chosen Keller to head the Football Association.
The new chairman of the German Football Association was, as expected, the former head of the Bundesliga Freiburg, Fritz Keller. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years without an opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an undeclared income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery in awarding the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said that one of the main goals would be to restore trust in the union and bring it out of the crisis. "It won't be the One Man Show, many people will be held accountable. The League is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all of his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After being elected to the head of the union, Keller left his post in Freiburg.
Děčín zoo rejoices in the little macaque
"There are currently seven members of our band. Her youngest member came into the world on August 17, given birth to a female named Buffy and her fifth cub, the father being a male named Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female carried the calf tightly to her body, unwilling for a long time to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, she has already started to put it away for a little while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokesperson Alena Houšková, adding that the zoo in Děčín has successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are endemic to Sulawesi Island, meaning that they do not live in the wild elsewhere in the world. A typical feature is the black fur and the crest on the head, according to which they are named. Crested macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, it feeds on both plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of forest trees, which are supplemented by flowers and leaves. It addresses the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Aside from the natural enemies that are pythons, everything else is written down by man. The locals hunt macaques as popular prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokesperson said.

Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
A tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. A 28-year-old Fabia driver lost control and went off the road. The car rolled onto the roof and he was wedged under it. He did not survive the injuries.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle traveling in the direction of Kokory left the road, where it overturned on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
I went to Brno recently and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take this kind of stuff to help the temps, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of the workings of the world, but there was nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected she was some kind of agitator.
After I finished reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lectures, like washing up and not being a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to indulge this person because you love him without even realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she'd cry and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started getting fucked in the head.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her, but that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and keep her from running amok again.
Such a person will drain you of feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Keep your distance.
When the insurance companies are frantically stealing in by buying a bunch of tests and rushing the positives, who wouldn't even know about the horrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is complicating things for companies, carriers, and others because their employees in the random number generator have been grounded for five days.
In the West, they had stopped their antics and accepted that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Valek's new, and he's got some thieving to do, and he's got to drive his ego by inventing bullshit.
I see we've got some good old-fashioned trash coming back.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "don't worry about it, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offered, as I wanted to help people, but the training sessions were more about scaring and talking people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make money, you had to whip up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only ones that made you feel like a pot salesman.
What I can tell you is that the experience was valuable, and you learned not to jump on the bandwagon and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even useful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
Milan Jakub: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Shandor
There is still confusion about the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakub. The media had speculated during the week that the Army had planned the final farewell to the Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, despite the family's wishes, as bombastic as soldiers can be. There were also discrepancies about the date of the funeral. Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday funeral date is valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just like they pay military honors. We will just deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and will not lack all military honors, including the overflight of fighters.
But there is still a tense atmosphere surrounding the final farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who worked with the general in the past!
For example, the former head of military intelligence, Andor Shandor (62), who met Milan Jakub 17 years ago. Shandor remembers his former colleague as hard-working, intelligent, and a "good man."
In addition, in recent years he had met him regularly at the celebrations of the anniversary of the establishment of Military Intelligence. This is why Jakub would like to say goodbye to Milan. "Personally, I'd go to Milan Jakub's funeral," Shandor told Lightning. It can't.
"I know of other people in the organization who'd like to go, but they're out of luck because the potentates are usurping the funeral for themselves. I don't think it's right to privatize a funeral like this," the security expert said. Nor does he like the allegedly contemplated closing the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of the military brass.
"The leadership of the army is not being kept secret, and neither are the leaders of military intelligence, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media's information is true and the family has really let themselves be swayed by the military, that is, of course, a family matter. Personally, I would never allow an army to overrun a family and their wishes," Shandor concluded.
Milan Jakub died on Saturday near Spindleruv Mlyn in a car accident. The head-on collision of the Milan Rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur competitor in the turn should have entered the opposite direction, Milan Jakub probably had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and may bear the consequences for the rest of her life. Police interviewed the culprit on Thursday.
No Czechs or children allowed. Choi revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation on prices and failure to respect the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the business. According to ČOI, he writes on his website that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically by the consumer whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child at the age of four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich said.
In the latter case, another Prague establishment refused to allow Czech-speaking people to sit at the table, while it allowed English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a spokesperson for ČOI described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been finalised, the spokesperson of the inspection was unable to provide further information on the mentioned restaurants.
However, only a very small proportion of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter were discriminated against. In total, the Choi carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it revealed other errors in 64 cases. These were mostly shortcomings in complying with the principles of fairness of sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the rules.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been imposed.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporation I work for.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own business and they don't stick their noses in anything.
So the regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that it's going on with us it's pretty good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what came out and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone judging you by any numbers, that sort of thing.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works, so they don't bother us much as long as the results are in.

A Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched fruitlessly for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police this afternoon confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is under investigation.
With respect to the family, we will not disclose any more information about the case.
My condolences, said Kulhánek on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28, coming home from work, and she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her work colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Interpol reported her missing worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this connection several days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but she did not disclose.

IV.
The risk of damage to the item passes to the buyer by taking over the item.

The buyer expressly declares that he waives his rights due to defects in the goods.
V.
The Contracting Parties declare that they are fully competent to act legally, that they have read the contract before signing it, that they agree with its content and that they sign in evidence.
This Treaty shall enter into force and effect on the date of its signature by both Contracting Parties.

In four municipalities, new councils were created at the end of the year.
On Saturday 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lusatia in Mosteck, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have broken up.
There were 99 valid candidates for the 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
They registered the highest interest in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new council elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for the 28 council posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections for municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections for the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put more demands on equipment and personnel security," Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
Let the fans be positive, wishes Hašek. Sparta awaits a hit in Pilsen
"We'll play to the limit, do everything we can to succeed. In order to manage the match gaming and results," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for club television.
In the week the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was her duty. She's relieved, but she's still in the playroom.
Even though the season slowly spills over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about early in his career.
“But it’s still Sparta, which has very good players. We are facing a difficult match," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
The last time the Spartans had arrived at Štruncová sady, in mid-May, it had been a straightforward affair in the superstructure. The visitors left after a soulless performance with a 0:4 beating, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the gap between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, Sparta now loses nine points after ten games of the new season. He's having one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It is not an easy situation for us or for fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta do not know if they will be able to use Tetteh in Plzeň, who received a two-match suspension for suspension in Plzeň, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre who remembers the last Spartans victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain in the numerous sickbay.
The home side, who have won their last five matches including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the game by defenseman Jakub Brabec, a Spartans outfielder.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Václav's death this year. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Entrance to the exhibition is free, it is open on both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archives looks at the written heritage of the reign of Václav IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically an encyclopedia of agriculture, or to a breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of St. George's Monastery at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he said.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts the half-figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin collection of tracts by John Wycliff from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the library of Wenceslas IV has survived in the Czech Republic. This library, according to experts, was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. But several codes have been saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the digital library Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On Saturday, an exhibition entitled What's Under the Floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will be opened free of charge in Klementinum.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while at the very beginning to come to terms with the fact that we had a fairly dangerous contagious disease, but there were no major hitches.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population at all its levels, that's what I'm having trouble with until now.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his ability to regain it.
The chances of that actually happening, however, are very slim, as others here have pointed out.
Besides, I'm not sure that shredding a file would even qualify as treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Increasing number of people under 35 who are without sex all year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between 18 and 35 who have reported that they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One could be the economic impact of a coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, has also contributed.
"Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among married people; by 2021, only 5% of them said they had not had sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
While spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that they are a minority among the single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is pushing the trend," Stone says of this thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less religious," the trend went from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people with no or lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, replacing this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they are good with money. Survey didn't confirm it.
"It turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher share of wrong answers," said Jaroslava Palendalová, director of KRUK.
Men and young high school or college students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial affairs from their parents (37 percent), through self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).
Parents are mainly consulted on financial issues by women, while men are more likely to look for information on the internet. Obtaining financial information from parents is prevalent at all ages of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Financial institution prospectuses, journals and publications have virtually minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is being demonstrated. That is why the level of financial literacy is crucial for parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring," said Palendalová.
Savings and investment are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Clearly, young people are asking themselves whether it is better to save and buy their own house or apartment, for example, or to enjoy and spend money, without savings and own housing.
94 percent of respondents follow a strategy of savings and investment in fixed tangible assets. This is true across all ages of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The strategy of the inquiry is then 100% advocated by married people with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income of more than 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
The whole point of mandating vaccination against covids is whether society should force a section of the population into behaving that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
I.e. the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, then it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have been responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get inoculated, and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think we are responsible for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it's pretty clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they'll really have themselves to blame.
The Brno Grand Prix? Ticket price increase imminent
The most expensive item each year before the Grand Prix is the listing fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Turin airport or the exhibition grounds. These are projects that are supported with public money," the economist added.
Brno Grand Prix
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- Problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing referral fee for promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- state of play: negotiations on a new contract for the organisation of the races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money out of public budgets for other things. But to some extent it is a political question, not an economic one," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorsport event may be even higher. The option of increasing the listing fee to almost double is in play.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to the organisation of the race. If the worst-case scenarios materialize, I am afraid it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the price," admitted Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Daily Rovnost has already reported, representatives of both the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in obtaining money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that aren't covered by cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," explained Vaňková.
In the following years, organizers can also get more money from tickets. "We have to sit down and say what the cost will be. And we have to adjust the ticket revaluation accordingly," said Brno's opposition representative for the ANO movement and former Mayor Petr Vokřál.
I still see myself as a boy who's just settling in, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The fact that I have something Romani in me after my father made me completely fascinated," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
More recent memories than Step One are of the role of a painter in the new film National Class. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have attracted him a lot. "The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but fun at the same time. It was filmed on National Street, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot of filming was also done in the South Town in Prague," he said about the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he's nominated for a Thalia Award for his role in The Little Prince, he doesn't see it as the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a guy who's just getting his bearings. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he said, not even thinking about the acceptance speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a kid, listening to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined talking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What's his formula for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, reminiscing about the awarding of the Czech Lions, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it did happen. He had new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it wasn't long before he was on the ground. He made it a virtue. He had a Vančur Stairs workshop where he taught how to safely fall down stairs at VIP events."
Costa Rica is a Champion in the Fight Against Climate Change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but that is what a lot of countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of world emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official tourist organization says that already about 95 percent of the energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017 Costa Rica operated on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation, setting an example for other countries in the region and around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot, given the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or fog forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent years.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for combating drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a religious man.
One day in high school, our teacher took us all the way across town to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there we went down one of these quite wide streets, and who do we not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but he and a friend got talking.
When she left, my teacher and I asked her what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she said.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're very spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After earlier visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must collectively make it clear that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border should be addressed through diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy Group, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, artificially created the migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to cross the border (illegally).
He has discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor, so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin will finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Vandal vandalizes cemetery in Dobruška
According to the notice received by the police, the vandalism in the dispersal meadow inside the Dobruš cemetery was to take place on Wednesday between 13:00 and 17:00.
"The material damage was estimated at CZK 60,000. Police officers are asking potential witnesses to report their findings in person at the office or by phone on the toll-free line 158," police spokesperson Lucie Konečná said.
Criminals are investigating the case as criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, punishable by up to three years in prison.
A drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it.
The car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her license for failing to give right of way and for fleeing the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her license after they found out she had a blood alcohol level of over two.
At the same time, she was told that she would be confessing her actions in court.
Slovaks succeed, only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for racism of fans. The national team was originally supposed to play Wales in a European Championship qualifying match without spectators, but instead the association will only pay a fine of EUR 15,000 (about CZK 387,000).
The UEFA Disciplinary Board has sanctioned Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during the recent qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting charges of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. It closed the stadium to both clubs for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000 and Hungary €67,000.
On appeal, the Slovaks were only fined €15,000 for offensive political chanting. The next match of the national team in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales on 10 October in Trnava will be open to fans.
Stores destroyed, fires in the streets, riots followed the memorial procession.
Five years ago, 43 students of the university in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been solved. The students were reportedly arrested by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of the local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports APTN.
On Thursday, a memorial service was held in Mexico's capital, as families expressed frustration that answers and explanations for their children's disappearance were still not being found.
But the mostly peaceful march was disrupted by smaller bands of vandals, destroying everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, didn't shy away from destroying monuments, set fires around the city and blew out windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said that he would do everything possible to capture and asked the public for any information that would lead to a clarification of the case.
Over 142 people were detained in the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, the investigators allegedly had to torture the suspects, adds APTN.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
Juraj Sajmovič, however, did not guard his film.
Czech family comedy makers have seen themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But what they forgot was the essential thing: the rules of the movie business.
After the kitschy film by F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, another film called Here We Guard is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Sajmovič Jr. loosely follows his previous film Here I Guard from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some of the familiar figures around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava boarding house, which is dying, so they start to invite dog-walkers, Julie's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Sajmovic (who is also a producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that elicits a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's review.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing field trip with a local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julie) in the woods, who falls into a coma, and is then taken away from the hospital by her family so that a miraculous process of dog healing can take place in the heart of Šumava's solitude.
Nothing against nature's cleansing cure and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a doggie contest, a Sumava charlatan, cops coming to a tip-off in search of “drugs” and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs – and which, of course, the baked family in the guesthouse gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma, and then sits perfumed and made-up with a cigar at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and meatloaf as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, he explains to the viewer that “that sometimes happens after a coma.”
Sajmovic's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, ability to build load-bearing situations, feeling for characters and punch lines, and direction.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parties, they don't have much to play.
The only positive feature of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomko and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot, and dog-talk, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters perpetrate.
The argument is not even the age-old membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man and dog there must be a knowledge of craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little too much eroticism and not enough feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurish stunt would fail.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to that crap all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in my case a part-time job.
Thomas Cook: The Czechs were thrown out of a hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees weren't enough.
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under negotiation and should be decided by the end of September.
According to the Vice-President of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will be up to the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated trips, the TA also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own pocket, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised to pay its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security to do so.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases where the local hotel fired all the tourists' offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs under German and who belongs under Czech society. He therefore threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the Czech Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up by almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, decreased by approximately seven million to 15.3 million crowns. From previous years, however, the company had an unpaid loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - besides CK Neckermann it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost total absence of precipitation during November, as observed at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of its long-term rainfall average for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It's also the right Christmas setting, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, and is occasional and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater resource, Lake Galilee, filled to the brim this spring with the last three rainy winters.
It's been dropping ever since.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"Depending on global warming and climate change, it can be expected that precipitation may decrease," Israel Water Authority spokesman Uri Schor predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Worse off are economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
Tank trucks are piling up on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"My orders are up seventy to eighty percent this year compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said that negotiations in Vienna had made "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Secretary of State Benny Gantz said Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had produced “no progress” and that world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing games with them.”

About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been prying and grilling the young lady in conversation to see what she wants me to do.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these tricks, I continued to annoy the lady with doubts and questions for a while, and finally thanked her and left.

Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with exhibition
An imitation of a normalisation room with a television in which footage of the brutal intervention of police officers against students on 17 November 1989 in Prague is played. This is also on the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on the National Avenue," said the exhibition's curator, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere with the fact that in Semily there was the first demonstration on 22 November, and then every day more people were gradually packed," he said. Among the most active was initially a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the town and the surrounding area to sign Charter 77, and Mr and Mrs Grandfather, who extended the petition Several Sentences. The Civic Forum was also created relatively quickly, according to Chvátal. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Approximately 50 photographs, taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta, should draw visitors into what was happening in the city at that time. The video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, which will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition, has also been preserved. At the demonstration, Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang. The Semily Archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "They said: Let's not get drunk on a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very quick at the time, for example, as early as December, the people voted in the all-Semitic vote that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also depicts the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to the old-timers and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the museum of the workers' movement at the time," Chvátal said. One room is supposed to give a sense of what it might have been like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with campaign posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters "With us to Europe" or Václav Klaus is still there under the heading of OF with the beautiful motto "Everybody for their community" added the curator.

Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snow at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operation as a result.
The skiers were not dissuaded by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate at the lifts.
While ski lifters do not complain about customer indifference, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region took to cross-country skiing tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branna on Šumpersk were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are awesome.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, he did not spare praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell the ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and show the necessary documents," René Hroneš from the Spindleruv Mlyn ski centre told the Czech Press Agency.
"We've only seen incident units," he added.
Some ski equipment rentals and stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava shop Skiopava.
He expects a greater surge in the ski course season.
David Šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that because of the covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By now, before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told the Czech News Agency.
People, he said, had become lazy with the pandemic and had learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental agency in the Novako complex on Boží Dar is experiencing great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
“We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a good life here, as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people go abroad who have no property here.
A business owner doesn't just go abroad.
But I agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply won't live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election.
If life's bad here, some traditional V4 freak might win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can't be put on a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmayer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for the shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior, and we're getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that might help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and she worked here for our health service," Harman said.
Police had earlier arrested a man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
Even I don't underestimate Ukraine that way.
These are not "huge quantities" but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we exaggerate the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made you think Russia wanted a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparisons with the situation in '38 are off at so many points, I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to honour the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban services.
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) will be faced with several changes starting on Sunday, particularly concerning suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed routes, and others ceased to exist.
Mladá Boleslav is newly integrated into the integrated system.

In suburban train transport, the S7 trains run from Beroun to Český Brod through Prague's main railway station.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will be newly stopped by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
The PID will be expanded to other areas.
Among other things, there will be buses to Svetlana nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in Mladá Boleslav will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.

Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only place to get food is next door to Billy's or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any exercise, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy only pizza, buns and a snack of yogurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a foot of snow like you, I'm afraid.
And it's not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're banned from skiing off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing more than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been going steady since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has missed the fact that Dara has captured a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to her ears.
She said he picked her up, not the other way around.
They've been the center of attention for three days, and although they're used to public attention, they're not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't give a damn and it's popping out of the can, or us whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's as if one of you wants an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are suited to each other, or if you insist that everyone really knows the details of your ex-partners and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was visiting to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been a long-term vice-president of Juventus Football Club.
They were coming clean now, waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana had been separated for three years, but they had not been married on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We, too, are only human, with families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - A farm in Nové Ves u Leštiny in Havlíčkobrodsko opened today for more than a month Pumpkin World. Decorations consisting of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by huge orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins have matured longer in the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipka family. Even now there are many of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told the Czech News Agency today.
Pipka grows many kinds of pumpkins, but for the last two years the weather was bad for them. This year's harvest was delayed and some species failed. "As usual, we have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some types of pumpkins for fancy people didn't work out," Pipková said. Nevertheless, the farm can choose from several types, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and digging decorations, to hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" pumpkins to ornamental pumpkins of various colors and shapes.
Pumpkin growing is laborious. Farmers dig the plants by hand and harvest the fruit, cutting the pumpkin stem with scissors. Pumpkin World has been open regularly since 2010, and past years have attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event are available on the farm website, where growers offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, including pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other possibilities of pumpkin preparation in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes and we will be inspired," Pipková said. She pointed out that some of the housewives also pickled the pumpkins like cucumbers.

Hi, the other commentators have probably said all the essentials, I'm just confirming that the dorms are great to begin with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments don't usually advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides it is close to most faculties of BUT (I don't know exactly where you are going).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still need some information :)
But this is an example of perfectly "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they can teach whatever they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or they can follow the state and the state will pay for it.
We can't let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full state contribution and can learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it is written by a man who, two days before, had said so about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, involving 500 Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., operating under the business name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, did not file for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellations will affect approximately 500 clients. According to him, the 800 clients of Neckermann who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic is ensured by their scheduled flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary that clients immediately contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann," added Šrámek.
The collapse of Thomas Cook took place on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency concluded an agreement under which creditors were to inject £900 million into the company.
Half of the sum was to come from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. As a result, it was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. On 20 September, however, it was reported that creditors had demanded that the travel agency obtain a reserve of £200 million, or the deal was off. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitisation that (even long-time professionals) either throw it in the eye somehow, or write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I wouldn't exactly recommend it.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in a note, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a good, dedicated student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'm guessing the author or the printer simply created his own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't that the Odrynian Empire rather than the Odrynian Empire?
Shh. Somebody already cracked this place for you.

Politicians have no idea what the 'topic' of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is amusing.
All the important approvals are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Plus, with the English thing, it's kind of interesting, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
Trump Considers Unregistering Chinese Stocks in the US
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering revoking Chinese companies’ stock market permits in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately went down on the news, dragging the market down with them.
The withdrawal of shares would be part of a broader effort to curb US investment in China, the source added. He confirmed a Bloomberg report that had sent financial markets into shock shortly before. Shares in Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI were down two to four percent.
According to government data from February, 156 Chinese companies are listed on the Nasdaq and NYSE. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism had not yet been developed to ensure the withdrawal of Chinese companies' shares from US stock exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a global recession. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's surplus in trade with the US.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the US and China are scheduled to resume on October 10. His goal is to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not in danger, reports Kremlík. However, a change of operator is in play.
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport launched preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a back-up plan that the State would use if the current toll contract were to be definitively cancelled. In addition, the state is preparing another provisional solution if the tender is not completed in time. Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) said on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal.
The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said the Minister.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would not therefore be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor would it be a use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience with the toll tender process so far, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and to hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period it has set," he said.
In addition to the new tender procedure, the Ministry will prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a fully-fledged solution.
The state will probably not take advantage of the offer made to it by the current administrator of the Kapsch toll in recent days. The Austrian firm offered to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated its belief that a backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore lodge an appeal against the decision of the Antitrust Authority.
On Thursday, the ÚOHS issued a decision prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. However, the prohibition will not take effect until a year after the Authority's decision becomes final. It is not final and may be appealed to the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won the tender for the new toll system and its operator. It was successful in the toll tender with an offer of CZK 10.75 billion for 10 years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the tender with an offer of more than CZK 13 billion.
"Terrifying study result." Islam does not belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians think.
1200 respondents were questioned, the survey shows a considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of the population in Austria fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand the introduction of a ban on the construction of mosques. For more monitoring of the centers of Islam 80 percent of respondents.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. Religious freedoms granted to Muslims are in danger of becoming narrower."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria there is no conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help to blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes toward Muslims are held by voters on the extreme right, those without a college education, or the elderly over the age of 75. Green voters, people under 30 and college students are the most welcoming.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
I don't get the hate on Ceil.
It's my third year working there, and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I drive home from work at 10:00 at night and never have a problem?
Only someone who's never set foot in a ghetto can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno probably lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't :And it's certainly not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to downtown, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slovacek (78) without Dada and the lover Gelema as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen this wreath, and I'm sure Lucy has one, too," the saxophonist told Lightning, confirming Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovacek still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annie, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we talked all the time, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy something for both Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the music video launch at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slovacek, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota's wife Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that clear.
"A travesty of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish jail
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. It concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in the local population.
The scientists mentioned in particular the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which is about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and which houses a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. People living around it, they say, suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, international criticism notwithstanding
It seemed to Sik that the government was taking no action on the matter, despite the clear conclusions of the study. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Officials subsequently prosecuted him for disclosing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which the water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be withheld. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"The Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem instead of pursuing alarmists through the courts," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.
Environmental and human rights organisations have long accused the Turkish Government of failing to enforce environmental regulations in certain regions, despite the rapid development of industry.
Following the foiled 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s regime launched a massive wave of arrests. Nearly 80 000 people are now behind bars, including many employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities have also suspended or dismissed 150 000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the attempted coup to persecute its opponents. However, the authorities argue that these measures are necessary to ensure national security.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know any other ingredients that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Policemen are few and cannot afford it, so firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are not at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, and there has been less precipitation in places where there has been no shortage of water.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage land also amplifies the impact.
Prepare for what in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Sigismund the Traveler or General Bocek. The Senate handed out commemorative medals.
The 96-year-old Bocek, who was a fighter pilot for the British Air Force during World War II, thanked the winners for the medals. "The Senate was one of the first to remember and not forget war veterans," he said. "The award I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we like it or not. Our successful present is based on these values," said Kubera.
The awards were cardiologist and most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of the Tomáš Bata University in Zlín Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveller and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, president of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The upper chamber praised his heroism - in January this year, he saved the lives of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them from a burning car. Former Speakers of the Upper House Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch were also awarded medals.
Zikmund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they gathered a number of documentary materials. Fištejn was a commentator and director of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with the public media. Steigerwald also served as a playwright and screenwriter, and Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary committee overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was awarded in advance to the astronomer and emeritus head of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of the year, the same award will be given to Madeleine Albright, a Czech native and US First Secretary of State, and Roger Scruton, a British philosopher and political scientist who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could hold people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and especially the minefield. The pictures of him wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face became iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would die in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son, Harry, has scored a point, going to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to a mine-clearing site in Diric, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. Surely he could not help remembering his beloved mother, whom he had lost at the age of only 13.
Harry gave an on-the-spot speech where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community to find peace, with which comes opportunities," he said, also appealing for the preservation and maintenance of wilderness and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on his official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to visit the place and community that were so important to his mother, to acquaint himself with their tireless mission, and to speak for all those she (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even if the problem was not universally popular," Sussex Royal's Instagram post said.
But royal fans may be disappointed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a quest to remember Diana. Both of them had separate agendas for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any price.

Sublessee
Yeah, that's the way it is, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey, and the tactics (I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total hoot, too.
And whether you're a "Russia Bear" hockey team or a "China Lama" hockey team, losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at all costs, is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what they skewer, what the referees notice, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And even if it were the other way around, it's the same as always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková lost in the 800 metres and neither the pole-sitter Romana Maláčová nor the hammer-thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, with which she surprised the previous year in London, passed the qualification.
On Friday, the hurdler Vít Müller will take part in the race and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw 65.46 metres with her third attempt and fell almost six metres behind her this year's best, which she would have had to improve in order to progress. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who only made it to the Championships at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF International Federation, finished in the fourth heat in the penultimate sixth place and her time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to reach the semi-finals. It was one and a half seconds behind its peak this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the corner, which took my strength quite a bit. I felt like I still had the strength, but that's where it slowed me down. I almost stopped and had to start again, so this was a little uncomfortable. I cannot be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was glad to have beaten at least one rival to the finish line. "She really wasn't well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she said. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyond from Uganda in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best 800-year-old in recent years is missing Caster Semenya from South Africa, who has too high a testosterone level in her body but, like some other runners, refuses the treatment that has been prescribed by IAAF rules since this year.
In the 100 metres heats, Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favourite, with a time of 9.98, the only one to get below the ten-second mark. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at 37 years old is trying to defend his title, also advanced to the semi-finals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is number two in this year's standings with 9.86, was expected to compete against Coleman, who has 9.81 this season.
Juan Miguel Echevarría, a Cuban, showed great form in the long jump qualification, making his first jump to the distance of 840 cm. No athlete has jumped that far in World Cup qualifying in 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's charts at 865 cm.
The Slovenes beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championships
Slovenian volleyball players will make a stunning play for the premier European championship. Supported by nearly 12,000 rioting fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact than the Polish world champions in the semi-finals. It was only the beginning of the first set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players were outmatched in defence and only the native of Cuba, León, scored from the players in the red-and-white jersey.
On the other hand, both Chebulj and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the unimpressive Gasparini, presented themselves in life form in the home line-up. The Poles paid the price for winning all their previous matches in this Euro, while the Slovenes gained confidence after tough battles in the play-offs with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenes lost 1:3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualification in Gdańsk this August, but were beaten back at home. Now, however, Stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena. After today, however, they have a second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, the Slovenes finished eighth, behind the Czech Republic.
Easy on the planet. Researchers' Night begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at the model of how smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Medical Faculty, which is normally not accessible to the public," advises National Coordinator of the Night of Scientists Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to ČZU and watch the film Green Desert," Navrátilová adds. Nine laboratories will offer guided tours. The slogan of this year's Science Night is "gently on the planet."
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic in 1967 at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since October 13th.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor for the British Office of Health Security, said on television Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about two weeks after infection, and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson may have broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister argued that the quiz was "virtual", via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán’s 12-year rule.
This will be an election of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
Not fair.
Nor are they likely to be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
It used to be a question not of whether Fidesz would win, but of how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder to keep power?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've been doing.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security, was leaked to independent media.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the novelties.
Everything starts with the language.

I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents, my mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I'm very choleric and I was very angry as a child, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, and they took me to the shower about twice to calm me down.
Sometimes they slapped me educatively, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, I used to fight quite a bit when I was a kid, now I hit something for discharges, and when I was younger I slapped my parents on the hand (so I wouldn't get too much of a punch), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my temper, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, maybe it's impossible not to screw up their kids a little bit, so I don't blame them.
I'm not offended, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
Kundami, then, I would call those who make laws of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a blackout?
Can we really count on people wanting and buying the product and you'll have something to pay the mortgage with?

For their study, researchers are looking for toddlers with a birth defect called ankle valgosity.
Ankle valgosity is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is normally treated with intense exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed a special shoe that should greatly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy and diagnosed children to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can report to the study via the web, where a registration form and all information are available.
Scientists are looking for 50 children diagnosed and 50 healthy. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is the moment when they take the first independent steps, typically letting go of, for example, the furniture they hold while trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each taking about 20 minutes, with half of the participants also wearing the shoes tested," Gimunová points out.
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial of the four accused of the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It has stirred up civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the leaders of Slovak politics and justice.
How major a break will the process be for Slovakia?
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges Hradec bek Nedomlel
In his case, increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradecký hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play in Friday’s game against the club where he recently played. The former Spartan, however, is convinced that his teammates will be similarly affected, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everybody wants to pull out against Sparta," says Hradec bek before the match of the fifth extra-league round.
In it, Hradec Králové will try to stretch his winning streak, which at the moment counts three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the most appreciated by fans, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't watch the games that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them the same way, if not better," points out the Hradec defender.
Hradec should not look back on last year's balance with Sparta. They lost three of their four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague in overtime. In addition, the management of Sparta has brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but from what we can tell, they are really busy this year," admits Nedomlel before the first game at the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in the Thirties.

This is all the fault of the press.
How is it possible that this petition got an order of magnitude more media attention than the anti-petition by the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled, and the company took the fall.
Czech TV was dying of covid six months ago.
Lucy White's father was no fan of hers. You won't believe what she did for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and own name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when she was a little girl performing at the cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the foam still lives.
"And I can remember exactly where my mother sat. I was born a singer," she admitted to Impulse Radio.
Her father, however, was a little worried about his daughter's future, and advised her to pursue a craft that had a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft, girl, craft. Keep your feet on the ground!' He even begged me to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks don't work anymore, I kind of do. I'm a trained seamstress and I make beads and pendants at home, which I then auction at auctions and use money to buy wheelchairs," she added with a laugh.

Comment by Jan Šindelář: Running the railways like a business
Sky's election, though perhaps not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and it hasn't changed since Wednesday night because one of the members resigned. The makeshift lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the outset, if only because the requirements for candidates were significantly relaxed, especially in the field of practical experience. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate should have worked in the past have been reduced. First the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský submitted perhaps the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without the experience of a large company he beat experienced guys from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting private sector managers was perhaps the brightest aspect (and the best hope) of the whole process. By now, those concerned know that they played only the role of narrative backdrop in the political game.
He may surprise Sky, show great talent, and eventually prove to be the greatest railroad boss of all time. But, at least in the beginning, it will have the taste of a political travesty. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, it has to cope with competition in market liberalization and lack of employees in operation. Drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What motivation do they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant in a china shop in the top management?
The second important group is creditors. We will see how the games at the head of the railways will be interpreted next spring, when the railways defend their rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, someone else comes to Moody's every year from Czech Railways to defend the rating. The Agency has been critical of the frequent changes in railway management and political influence on the company this summer.
The ANO movement, among other things, spells out the motto that the state must be run like a business. For starters, it would be enough to run a large state-owned company as a business, rather than as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it was led by the best. They volunteered, but the state scorned them. One can certainly argue that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political affair. Then we can dispense with the antics of the selection process.

Another government shuts down and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository is missing.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs a fundamental overhaul.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected when choosing and permitting a deep-sea repository for high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delay.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The municipalities expect from the Act a stronger strengthening of their possibilities when deciding on the repository, as mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and as required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticised by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the site selection for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Management to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a substantive plan almost completely ignores public involvement and makes municipal citizens practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of locating and selecting the site for the repository, its authorisation and operation.
In reality, according to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a site for a repository.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they make comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or the minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
An action, if any, shall have no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of self-government that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
Moreover, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, vice-mayor of Cejle municipality from Hrádek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: "After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis the state authorities in the search for a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction in a similar way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for potential storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Though he hadn't felt the need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he'd been spooked by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on which boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that's expecting readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, perhaps a college text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
Plus, there's more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so the "boss" is kind of like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (only Catalan is interesting, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for a story or game, a computer-controlled opponent stronger than all the others and guarding the completion of a level or a task.
And where are the spectators? Doha Can't Be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere that prevailed at the sold-out stadium in London in 2017 and at the European Championships in Berlin last year.
Giant banners on the walls of the Doha skyscrapers invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified its scenery will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings," organizers say.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with brightly coloured sails depicting the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics in Qatar went to an area where, despite the annual Diamond League meeting, it has no roots.
No wonder, then, that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for the ten days of the Championship, even though their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, or less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling the uncovered sections of the stands by at least half. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (though the organizers themselves deny it) giving free tickets to migrants working as laborers, as well as to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can also comment positively: "This is how we can inspire future generations."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, and after athletics, it will be football in 2022. The financial offers of an oil power will always be lucrative, even for rich sports federations. This is the reality of today's sporting world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot help but feel a purely sporting sigh that the IAAF leaders should have timed the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula better - and for a different year. The extremely late deadline imposed by the climate disrupts the entire schematic of the pre-Olympic season and thus the preparation for the crucial Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for this with the technological innovations with which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it's 37 degrees right now? Already the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built right into the blocks, are supposed to give television viewers a detailed picture of what happens to athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been wanted since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow memo about her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech Police is working closely with the British Police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information on the case," she added.
The search for Petra was announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin, with brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
The MP Harriet Harman has also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We're very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
It's not clear who he is or what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month's attacks intensified significantly as the year ended.
We had a big campaign on Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
So far, the attackers' strategy remains the same.
An infected attachment in an e-mail is meant to draw the user's attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its name, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November caught rather global campaigns.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months, recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity.
Today's demo of brainiacs who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or sections of the population has led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-dragons and associates couldn't have filled or paid for a parade this big.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are growing in popularity, reminding me of A Million Moments for an Upside-Down Democracy.
Sometimes I think they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It won't be a left-wing or a centre-left movement, you can bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to have a booster every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant scientific achievement of which mankind is justly proud.
End of stalemate: Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office in a few days.
The country’s political crisis has been ongoing since April, when the last government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties, preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power, failed to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
"Secret" footage is a global hit.
Concerns were growing in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived is also calling for information on the staff of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behavior, and we're getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncová worked, said in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, 28 November and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her coworkers.
Srncová, according to the British media, worked as a "nurse's assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health establishments said in a Twitter post.
"We would urge anyone who may have any information that might help locate her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The Šumperská amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the county pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous tipster to be violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court accepted that the paintings of Mole in the rooms of Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was life and death.
The Municipality referred complaints to the RMD, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to gape.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership and after a month the RMD began to "intensively address the situation".
Microplastics have reached human intestines, study confirms for the first time
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwable has published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human faeces. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia, small particles of plastic measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in samples of all subjects. None of the eight subjects was vegetarian, six of them avoided sea fish, all of whom drank water from plastic bottles and plastic-wrapped food.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example, for the cosmetics industry, or are produced by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soft drinks; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the human digestive system was therefore only officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
Of course, both the layman and the scientist know that this is not a good thing. But humanity still doesn't know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "It's the first study of its kind, and it confirms what we've been thinking for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of the presence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health," Schwabl says.
It is now known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, making it easier for toxic chemicals and other pathogens to be absorbed into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But that will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, mankind will consume one-fifth more than it does today. The current rate is a staggering million bottles bought per minute. Around eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and poisons the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already adopted restrictions and other measures, such as Kenya's ban on plastic bags, on pain of draconian punishment. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws), and the Czech Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures, while nice, are wholly inadequate.
