When I tried to buy the entry package, I got a blue and orange package.
The orange one is more than double the price.
What's the difference?
I didn't understand it when I looked it up, so please tell me.
Right now, there should only be blue.
If there is, it may just be an old product left over.
They are both the same, just different in appearance.
Karate vs Jiu-Jitsu

Was the destiny plan in "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" the one where Durandal was dumped by Talia?
Is the gene so correct because he broke up with Talia because they couldn't have children because of a genetic mismatch?

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Does that mean it's no longer possible to be a comedian? TV is full of comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff were laughing behind their backs even when they were saying something that wasn't particularly funny.
Even though it's clearly not a funny place, it's creepy to say, "I'm a popular comedian, so I have to laugh at everything I say."
But if the staff don't laugh, the comedian will be in a bad mood, and it will be unsavory for work relationships.
Like the black companies of the past, that industry is like a sports club, and it seems that some entertainers' egos are too big and they usually have a bad attitude, otherwise they wouldn't be able to make a living.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say, "Don't underestimate comedians," as if the comedians themselves are heaping on the difficulty of their work.
I know I make a lot less money before I can sell, but people keep telling me I'm at the top of the list of the worst jobs to be a comedian.
It only sounds like a justification for the glorification of one's own career and the over-elevated status of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is pretty tough, but I feel like it's getting harder and harder to get in touch with the entertainment world.
I'm sorry for complaining so much.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart...

Items ordered from Tsukumo Online Shop were replaced without permission
Summary: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, received a wired version of the mouse, and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund
It's more of a mail-order problem than a topic of self-made PCs, but I can't agree with it no matter how I think about it, and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It all started when I found MSI's wireless gaming mouse for 3,280 yen (link: Uotaku) at Tsukumo's online store's Tsukumo Day sale that started the previous Friday.
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so considering the possibility of a price mistake, I checked the wired version page and it was 5,071 yen (linked fish print), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake
The order email arrived normally, and the next day shipping email also arrived
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written in these two emails as well as in the purchase history on My Page.
At this point, I thought I would receive the wireless mouse I ordered because there was no notification of a mistake or cancellation from the time I placed the order to the time it was shipped.
Here's the problem: a few hours after shipping, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in the registration of the product.
According to the email
* They were selling the wireless version at a special sale price, but it was actually the wired version
* We've already shipped wired mice, so
1. refuse to receive and cancel all
2. return only the mouse for a refund
3. use a wired mouse as it is
Choose how to respond.
The wired version and wireless version of the product page are separated, and even though it says wireless version in the purchase history, email, and delivery slip, it seems that it was sent by replacing it with the wired version without permission
Isn't it terrible that I was sent something different from the product I bought without my consent, and if I want a refund, I have to send it back here?
Even if I eventually accept the refund, I want to fight back somehow, so please lend me your wisdom.

Isolated twice... Typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple their stockpile of food < Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture > (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! news
Matsumoto Yoshiro from the Takahara district of Yamatsuri-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.
The typhoon that hit eastern Japan in 2019 had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "at first, it's like," Are you serious? "
I wondered if it would break down so quickly, or if it would be washed away. "the only road leading to the Takahara area, the Takahara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan Typhoon, leaving 30 residents from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to use the JR railway bridge, which is not normally open to traffic, to transport necessary supplies.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "normally, cars can come to the garden, but when I get out of the car there, I hold it in my hand or carry it on my back and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt grateful for the means of transportation and the car." the emergency bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Matsumoto Yoshiro: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I want to make sure I have enough for two or three days. "
Matsumoto Misako: "it's not someone else's problem, I don't know when a disaster will hit me, so I felt again that it would be better for everyone to stock up a little." meanwhile, Yamatsuri Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" where a bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Takahashi Ryuichi, Director of Yamatsuri Town's Education Division: "we have made an announcement that we would like to designate October 12th as" Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day "and make it a day to think about preparedness for disaster prevention next year and beyond.
I think we're more aware than ever that the unexpected can happen. "

However, as far as I can remember, in Hiroyuki's video, he said that people who are bad as parents go to organizations that provide food, clothing and shelter, and even if they are told not to come, they will do something if they go (I remember), so there seems to be such an organization.
Para-marathon experience in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! news
On December 12th, 2021, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event where people could run a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.

The participants... "The scenery was so different and it was so much fun."
"while running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's hard when you're running, but it's great fun to be able to run while having fun, and I'm glad I was able to compete with everyone else and work hard until the end." a representative from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said, "We want people to be able to enjoy it at sports gyms in the future," and they hope to install it at the beginning of the year.

Be careful when buying a second-hand home!
Pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! news
● Newly established "Building Condition Survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Second-hand housing transactions are strong.
Prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a home has increased due to the coronavirus pandemic, the popularity of properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station," "large-scale," and "tower," which are soaring, has concentrated, and the number of relatively inexpensive new properties has decreased sharply, which may also have had an impact.
[see image in this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a survey of the condition of buildings, so-called inspection, for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of secondhand houses (https: / / www.mlit.go.jp / common / 001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with housing checks the current state of the property, including deterioration, and the condition of the building, compiles a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will bring benefits to both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale transaction, giving buyers peace of mind.
This, in turn, will lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the second-hand house they are planning to buy and buy it convincingly, and at first glance, it is a system that has great advantages.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative to investigate the condition of the building.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate company in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain that "when brokering a property, we can introduce an architect who will investigate the condition of the building" or "we can't," but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used car market is booming.
It is a system in which buyers request a building survey from a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" before buying or selling a home.
In the U.S., for example, inspections are carried out on 70-90% of second-hand home transactions, depending on the state.
In the sense that the "buyer" takes the lead in the inspection, the nature of the Japanese-style inspection, in which the "seller" is the main player, differs greatly.
The seller tries to make the condition of the building look as good as possible and sell it as high and as fast as possible.
On the other hand, buyers want to live with peace of mind by carefully examining the contents of the survey and making appropriate repairs.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap between the goals and thoughts of both parties.
For this reason, the following risks have been pointed out as being of concern to the Japanese system.
The scope of investigation for seller-led inspections set by the government is kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that inspections will be carried out in a "discreet" manner, such as not reporting adverse findings to the seller.

It was pretty tough.
However, I was mentally healed (?), so I was full of motivation.
My body couldn't keep up, and I was working as a researcher, so I fell asleep at work.
It was the second time in a year, so I thought lightly that I would take a month off and say goodbye to the shitty garbage company, but it was more serious than I thought and the medicine didn't match, so it lasted longer.
Anyway, it's important to go to a psychiatrist and have them deal with it correctly, as well as keeping a history of hospital visits (very important).
As long as you have a history of hospital visits, even if you leave the company for personal reasons, you can change it to retirement for company reasons at the discretion of the doctor in Harowa, so the hurdle to receive unemployment insurance etc. will be lowered dramatically
Even if you can't find a job, even if you want to take a break, you'll be able to relax your mind and heart.

Ginza was an island?
5 trivia you can talk about while wearing a silver bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! news
"this used to be a peninsula.
As proof of that...... "It's only in Ginza that you can show off a little trivia.
Here are some fun facts about Ginza that will make you want to tell someone about it.
Going above Ginza!?
First time sneaking into Kinza
As you walk through Ginza, you can see the vestiges of the history that the area has carved out, such as strange place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
When I was walking in Ginza with my girlfriend, I was suddenly struck by the silence, and I thought, "This used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
"Ginza" in Chuo-ku, Tokyo is synonymous with the downtown area that gave birth to "XX Ginza" in various parts of Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a mint for silver coins, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At the time, it was called "Shinryogae-cho," but when it moved to Kakigara-cho, it came to be known as "Ginza."
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" sticking out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, an inlet ran from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is today's Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the bay and developed the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city blocks and laid out moats to develop boat transportation.
They then cut down the earth from the moat and Mt. Kanda to fill in the bay.
In front of Tiffany's Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument that marks the site of the Ginza government office as the "Birthplace of Ginza," so if you're interested, why not look for it?
Ginza's "pilgrimage to sacred places" known only to those in the know
In Ginza, there is an annual "pilgrimage to sacred places" known only to those in the know called the "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour."
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the one that stands out the most is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of Kabukiza.
Many people visit the shrine on the far right of the Kabuki-za Theater before or after watching a play.
On the other hand, Ryuko Fudoson is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and Ginza Shusse Jizoson is located on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi on the Ginza Terrace.
"Hodo Inari Shrine," "Azuma Inari Shrine" and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley and are hard to see, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for being revered by the famous kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon, and "Success Inari Shrine" located at the 1st floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places where Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu are enshrined, but most shrines enshrine Inari as their deity.
The Inari Shrine, where a fox welcomes you in front of the main shrine building, was built in large numbers in places where there are many farmers, as it is believed to bring good luck for a good harvest of rice.
As a result, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said to bring prosperity in business, and the faith spread even in Ginza, Japan's busiest shopping district.

Man's body found in Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! news
Just before noon on the 12th, a man was found dead lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya.
Police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to the police, just before 11: 30am on the 12th, a passerby found a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidanmi, Moriyama-ku, and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but was pronounced dead on the spot, officials said.
Police are rushing to confirm his identity and are investigating the cause of his death.
Meanwhile, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Sunagawa, Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki, and was confirmed dead.
There was no disturbance in the man's clothing, but there was a bicycle lying nearby.
Police are investigating the circumstances at the time, as well as rushing to confirm his identity.
In the middle of February, the benefit will be paid to households that are exempt from resident tax, but will it be paid if one person in the house is exempt from tax?

Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy to expand overseas gas field business (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! news
POSCO International announced on the 12th that it has signed an agreement to acquire a stake in Australia's Senex Energy, as well as an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, the acquisition process is expected to be completed in March next year, with the approval of Senex Energy's shareholders' meeting and the approval of the local subsidiary still pending.
The acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M & A) since POSCO International was integrated into POSCO Group in 2010.
POSCO International and Hancock Energy have agreed to invest 50.1 percent and 49.9 percent of the total 770.9 billion won, respectively.
POSCO International explained that it decided to make the acquisition because demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and in the hydrogen market, blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the market along with green hydrogen.
With the acquisition, POSCO International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local onshore gas field operators in Australia.

The pain in the knee may be "osteoarthritis"!?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! news
Editor: I've been suffering from knee pain recently.
What kind of diseases are possible?
Maruyama: there are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, "osteoarthritis" is common among Japanese people.
Editor: does this mean that the joints will be deformed?
Maruyama: that's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, cartilage can become worn out or distorted.
As a result, it can lead to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knee?
Maruyama: yes.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers of the hands, neck, hips, big toes, and hip joints.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee, and it is called "osteoarthritis."
Editor: in the first place, what is the structure of a joint?
Maruyama: the joints are made up of two bones that are joined together in an uneven pattern.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage," and the area around the joint is wrapped with "articular capsule."
Editor: it's a complicated structure.
Maruyama: that's right.
There is a tissue called synovial membrane in the inner layer of the joint capsule, which makes the joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That's why it's said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movement."
Editor: what kind of symptoms occur when you have osteoarthritis?
Maruyama: articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly with each other.
It's like a cushion, so to speak.
However, if this is worn down or distorted, it can deform and inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
It's basically pajamas, but when my pajamas are in the wash, I sleep with my jersey on!

Well, there are two kinds.
An acquaintance of mine was heavy, but he quit completely.
So he decided to give it a try, and just quit.

Three gambling and games from the Kaiji series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! news
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series is explosively popular, especially among men.
One of the best parts of this game is the extreme game that puts your life on the line.
[photo] Just looking at it makes my feet tremble...... Challenge yourself to walk across the steel frame!
So this time, I'd like to examine Kaiji's games that can actually be played or that are being practiced in the planned video.
Swamp This is the trap-filled pachinko "Numa" that appeared in "Gambling Broken Record Kaiji."
In the original, Kaiji was surprised by the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball.
In this "swamp," there were large traps of "nail forest," "mobile role" and "three-stage croon," and it was said that it was almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of tricks, and in the end, he went into the rough business of placing a plastic water tank on the building to sink and tilt the ground, and he succeeded in capturing it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball," and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you will be able to enjoy the feeling of Kaiji.
Steel frame crossing At the "Star Side Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, Kaiji and other debtors were asked to perform the steel frame crossing in the "human horse race."
Debtors compete for speed as they try not to fall over a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people take part, and the top two can win cash prizes, but there are only four steel beams, safety measures are inadequate, and the chance of death is quite high.
This steel-frame crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can have an extremely close experience at the Eagle Bridge set up at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.
This Eagle Bridge has a single steel bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and beyond that, "Sky Swing" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared, and you can walk to it.
Of course, there are safety measures in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi became a hot topic when he posted a video of himself walking across Eagle Bridge on YouTube, saying, "You can experience steel-frame crossing in Japan."
E-Cards E-Cards is a two-player card game.
A total of 10 cards are used, including one emperor card, eight citizen cards, and one slave card, and the players are divided into the emperor side and the slave side.
The game is very well done, with the emperor being strong against the citizens, the citizens being strong against the slaves, and the slaves being strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, he will have his ears cut off.
In the end, Kaiji realized that the ear-destroying device attached to his ear, like an earphone, was reading his mind by sensing and transmitting changes in his pulse and body temperature, so he confused Tonegawa by cutting off his own ear to the limit and making his body abnormal, and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of her competing with Fujiwara Tatsuya, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, using an E-card, which caused a stir.
Is it possible to experience the feeling of being Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's also true that when you read manga, you get a taste of what it's like.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A gentle boost for the new year: Tora's large votive tablet at Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Newspaper
At Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the new year are underway, a large ema (votive picture tablet) of the next year's zodiac sign, Tora, has appeared.
Students from Tohoku University of Art and Design, who designed the statue, visited the shrine on the 11th, and a ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has been asking students at the University of Arts and Technology to draw the original picture of the ema.
This time, the work of Tsuchiya Yui (22), a third-year student, was selected from among the nine students in the Japanese Painting Course of the Department of Fine Arts, taught by Professor Suenaga Toshiaki.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and the center is about 1.8 meters high.
Tsuchiya said that she painted it with "the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing my back as I step into the new year."
The image of the tiger stopping to look at the cherry blossoms expresses the hope that "even in a rapidly changing world, we can afford to appreciate the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's designs are also depicted on ema (votive tablets) that are distributed to the public.
Chiba Kenichi (44) of Gonnegi said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano, where we want to continue to live" 4th high school students workshop in the city to make a proposal: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-digi
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano, where people want to continue to live."
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center, an intermediary support organization, the young people's voices will be compiled and presented to the mayor and others.
"when is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, the students said things like, "When you get excited with a lot of people," and "When you play the drums."
The first event was held on November 13th at Hinode Fureai Kaikan.
Using the "World Café" method, in which 18 high school students and members of the local community move around the "island" where each theme has been decided, they thought about "an interesting town," "a comfortable town to live in," and "a town where you can feel a sense of purpose in life."
Each idea was written down on sticky notes and put on imitation paper to organize them.
"a town with a lot of young people looks interesting," he said. "transportation such as trains and buses are essential for livability."
We will continue to discuss whether there is anything in common.
"I used to think Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is fascinating," said an 18-year-old third-year student at Tamano Commerce and Industry High School.
A third-year student (18) from Binan High School said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to be in a place rich in nature," and by talking with adults, they seemed to have noticed not only the issues in the area, but also its appeal.
In the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to sort out the content of the proposal.
The mayor and superintendent of schools will be invited to make an announcement in February of next year.
Higashi Rie, the director of the center, said, "I hope it will foster a love for the hometown among high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to become actively involved in community development."

How to find a new way to wind a stole (Sankei Newspaper) - Yahoo! news
Stoles are an essential item in winter, but don't you sometimes feel that the fabric is loose around your neck?
It's a good idea to adjust the balance while looking in the mirror after winding, but I've heard people say they don't know the trick.
I thought it would be nice if there was a stole that didn't cling to the fabric and could be rolled up quickly, but then I found something novel.
The stole of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is a more compact size than the general one.
When I first saw it, I thought, "How can it be so short and rolled up?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is made into one piece by knitting a long and narrow piece of cloth, and the whole is like a mesh.
The mesh allows the end of the stole to pass through.
So you don't have to tie the ends together, you can just roll it up and fasten it.
It is made of fleece material and is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular as outerwear, but many people wear them in combination with stoles to prevent their shoulders from getting cold.
I'm sure it's convenient to have a stole like this.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's called Get Buck and it was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's fresh in many ways, like a life-size Beatle...
I'm giggling because it's just before the break-up, but it's not the dramatic giggling I imagined.
Paul who is annoying like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" while trying his best to organize, George who is groggy like "But, but," John who is late and unmotivated while saying opinions and jokes rather calmly... Ringo who plays the role of coaxing doesn't actively interject, and sits in the back with a face like "I'm in trouble"
We don't hate each other enough to fight like that, but there's a strong feeling in the air that "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance started, everyone was really talented.
The process of turning a little phrase into "that famous song" while both of us are saying "how about this?" is dangerous
Especially the moment when the title "Get Buck" is completed is amazing
It's amazing that the scene where a casual hum like a hum gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics enter is well recorded.
It's amazing because you don't get to see the songwriting process like this.
Also, it's only natural, but everyone is so fat that just watching them perform makes me happy.
It's still only one of three episodes, but so far I've had the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
When the four of them started writing songs while complaining about something, they seemed to be having fun, but when it came to the question of where to hold the concert, the producers and publicity people started saying things like, "The Beatles are the best in the world!" and it was easy to see that they had already left their hands.
Well, documentaries also include the director's interpretation, so it may be that Peter Jackson felt that way...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising, so I thought that might be why there are so many scenes where Paul looks like a bad guy.

Frequent tornadoes cause major damage in the U.S. The effects of unseasonably warm weather and strong cold (Weather News) - Yahoo! news
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern part of the United States.
It is thought that the atmospheric conditions became very unstable due to the strong cold air moving south from what was a record warm place for this time of year, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record-high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the high temperature on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time has risen to nearly 30 ° C.
In the midst of this record-breaking warmth, a strong cold air mass of -30 ° C or lower moved southward at an altitude of 5500m, causing an active front to form due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It is believed that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern part of the United States is originally prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this time.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during the winter, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and wind gusts on Friday, the 10th, local time.
According to this, there are two main areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of tornadoes, reached EF3, which is the third strongest of the six levels, and it is believed that gusts of around 70m / s were blown momentarily.
Depending on the future investigation, it may be determined to be EF4 to 5.
In Japan, JEF (Japan's Improved Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Improved Fujita Scale and is tailored to the conditions of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the tornado in the United States this time, has a good chance of occurring in Japan, and it is at the level of collapsing wooden houses.

U.S. tornado "largest in history" cries for help in live broadcast from under debris (Daily Sports) - Yahoo! news
Regarding the damage caused by tornadoes in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden on the 11th (12th Japan time) said with a solemn look that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States."
CNN TV in the U.S. and others reported.
"we're going to do everything as a federal government," Biden said.
"we still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives have been lost," he said.
The death toll is feared to be more than 100.
More than 30 tornadoes touched down in at least six states, including Kentucky, from the night of the 10th until the early hours of the 11th.
A record 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of tornado damage was recorded in Missouri and other states in 1925, but a CNN weather expert estimated that this time it was the largest, at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, one of the hardest-hit areas, a candle factory that had been operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also badly damaged.
There were 110 people working there at the time, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of it.
In the darkness, a woman trapped under 1.5m-thick debris felt the weight of rescuers searching on top of the debris and called for help via a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the woman's cries for help, the live broadcast also featured screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which another woman is believed to have sung while crying to distract herself from her fears.
Amber Brown, a convenience store worker in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued. she was unharmed.
Looking back, he said, "Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more of a terrifying sound, like something erupting from the ground."
A Mayfield Police Department officer said, "We will continue the search until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months or years it will be, "he said as he continued his desperate rescue efforts.
At least six people have been confirmed dead after a warehouse belonging to online retailer Amazon partially collapsed in Illinois.
Train cars have been derailed due to the impact of being cut off, and highways have been blocked one after the other due to overturned vehicles.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.

If you have a "live-in job" like an inn or resort part-time job, it would be nice to have both an address and a source of income, but in the current social situation of the corona disaster, there seems to be few options

There's a related search for "live-in job with translation," so it looks like many of my colleagues are like that.

It has long been said that there is a difference in the way people think about star rating systems.
The argument is that while other countries use five stars as a standard and deduct points from there, Japan adds / subtracts points with three stars as a neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars has a completely different meaning between "there is a point deduction factor" and "it's not a masterpiece, but it's an honorable mention."
If you base it on 5 stars, "works that have no flaws" and "works that are of the highest standard in everything" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, I think it's a flaw in the system that doesn't present the meaning of stars, but since it's actually being operated in such a system, I'd like you not to give it 3 stars (bad reputation).

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB that can be plugged into a common hose size?
Since the capacity of the power supply that can be obtained from USB is approximately 2A at 5V, it is at most 10W.

"fried seasonal fish caught in the nearby sea and fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce" from "hakobune" | Life and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Bento box: "fried seasonal fish and shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
"Hakobune" is a take-out specialty store that offers colorful bento boxes and deli (prepared side dishes) made with plenty of vegetables.
Kazuki Takayuki (39) and his wife Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year, "so that people can enjoy the feeling of a restaurant at home."
One of the popular bento menus is "Seasonal fried fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish are selected at the market according to what is good at the time.
Takayuki says, "For fried shrimp, I try to make the bread crumbs as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients," and for fried shrimp, you can directly feel the plump texture.
The lunch box comes with four kinds of vegetables and deli, rice made from Hinohikari rice grown in Saga Prefecture, rice with minor grains, and soup.
The vegetables are home-grown from the buckwheat fields or purchased at direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the time of year, but Takayuki is trained in French cuisine, and dishes such as lape and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, "it has a familiar and comforting taste" like dashimaki tamago (rolled egg) (Yumi), and it is a blend of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
The bento box "Hand-kneaded hamburg steak made with domestically produced snoring meat" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, they will also release a "charcuterie set," a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and found something interesting, so I used it.
Ride comfort It's not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not so much that I get drunk)
Speed, of course, is slow.
Safety I slowed down when there were people around, and in some cases I stopped completely, so I think it's safe, but I thought it was dangerous in some places
The eyes around me hurt, it's good to be seen, but it hurts my heart to be seen as if I'm in the way.
Overall review It's not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it would be easier to use if there were a little less people, or if there was consideration such as having them move closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create a dedicated lane so that it wouldn't interfere with other people walking.
However, I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little less people because it was relaxing and you could relax while watching the scenery.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a very patient heart, with the excitement of the near future wondering if this kind of automated driving will become mainstream in the future, and the comfort of the pain of the eyes around you.
I was so embarrassed.

If you look very closely, you may be able to see a little bit, but it's a rice bowl that doesn't use eel at all.
It's actually "! eggplant!" (if you tap it, the correct answer will come out)
I like eel, but if you actually think that everyone is just eating it with sauce and that the eel part can be anything other than how it's actually cooked... I thought that the texture and volume of the eel was quite important.
I don't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat them.
Recipe used: EGGPLANT "UNAGI" - Woks of Life (I used Japanese pepper instead of green onions.)
It's just a steamed one grilled with sauce on a frying pan, but it's a dish that takes about 30 minutes to make.
I'm 20 years old.

Work doesn't go well.
I'm considering taking a leave of absence around October, and if I extend it with a half-hearted sense of responsibility, it's finally reached its limit.
I think I'm going to quit my job and quit IT.
But I don't know how to live from now on.
I used to work part-time at a supermarket, but I couldn't even do that kind of work (so I worked part-time as an engineer)
Have any LLLers ever taken a leave of absence or retired due to illness?
I think the new Roadster will be NE, but does that mean E = EV?
If you follow the order, it's just alphabetical order, but there is a possibility that it will be an EV after E.
If so, I think I'll go with Ne.

Attempted murder in Daizai, Saga City on the 12th after a man was slashed and fled on a motorcycle | Incidents and Accidents | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1: 25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s or 40s on a street in Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.

A family's long journey to establish environmental protection in China's frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! news
(Kato Yuki: corporate Consultant, Find Asia, a Hong Kong company) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest variety of mammals and the third largest variety of plants.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists in addition to the environmental protection carried out by the local government.
Xishuangbanna, located in southwest China's Yunnan Province, is one such area.
Her younger sister, Lee Wan-soo, is currently active as an actress. Sisapanna is a region that shares borders with Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people, who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flow through this area.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture Xishuangbanna is only 0.2% of China's total area, but it is home to about 25% of wild animal species and 20% of plant species.
This time, we met Mr. Lee Min-ka, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and heard about the details of his activities.
Started environmental protection activities with her German husband -- I heard that it's been 20 years since you started environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger for this?
Mr. Lee: our environmental protection activity, "Tenchu," started in 2000.
It all started with my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China science project.
It was the only tropical rainforest in China and had one of the highest biodiversity levels.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of tropical rainforests was previously carried out in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and study biological resources.
Then she met me, who was a reporter here, and we got married.
Q: did you not have an interest in nature conservation before that?
Lee: I'm from Sisapanna, but I wasn't interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
That's why my husband and I decided to push ahead with the project without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though they don't have a well-formed face or are not particularly tall. why do you think that is?

It's something that comes out naturally the moment you have confidence in yourself.
I'm sure that person has a firm confidence inside.

I suddenly think, is it fine to say that the other person's clothes are homey or the color is good?
It's not detailed, is it?
I can see it though.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been praised for being detailed, so I don't know what it means.
I wonder if he praised her in detail.
What would you do if Yokomine Sakura confessed to you?
I reply, "Sakura confessed to me, and my heart is in full bloom, so I'd like to ask you to do the same," and go out with her.
And to keep in touch, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like with each other.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open one later when I want to?
The procedure will be completed faster if you open it at the same time.
Now, it takes about a week to complete.
Separately, there is no fee, so we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

[Omakan / Personal Memo] It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of CTD in the MOD's own environment
CTD due to multiple factors has been occurring while stable data until March has not been able to play much since GW, and it took a lot of time to identify it as I only looked at it little by little on holidays.

Is it due to the additional armor worn by some actors / NPCs or a shader setting error in the body mesh?
At first, I focused on checking site attacks and OnHit-related motion / combat mods (.dll ones), but the result was like this.
I don't think there have been any similar bug reports, at least not at the English, German or French level.
I thought it might be helpful as a reminder if anyone has similar CTD problems in a Japanese environment, so I posted it.

Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Home Visit Nursing - After Today's Home Visit Nursing
Since I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving home-visit nursing care for a long time, and I think I have built a very good relationship with the nurse (female) at the home-visit nursing station that I am currently using, as I have known her for a long time.
We talk about a lot of things every week.
Of course, they also do things necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but above all, today's home-visit nursing made me realize how important it is for people with mental illness to have fun communication.
Today, we're having a chat about gender differences between men and women, or even discussing gender theory, lol.
We also talk about the sexual desires of men and women, why she got divorced, and whether it's okay to do things like that as a visiting nurse.
Sometimes, I dress up as a woman.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of home-visit nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, elderly nurses who are no longer able to work in the wards come in and only provide administrative support, or that occupational therapists come in for home-visit nursing, but they give instructions from above, saying, "We're doing medical care."
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are really good nurses who face me frankly on an equal footing with me, who has a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing care, and some of you may be considering receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very helpful for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves of it, you should take it.
And choose a good home-visit nursing station.

Korea's hydrogen technology patents one-fifth of China's... "Delay in implementing hydrogen economy roadmap" (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese version) - Yahoo! news
In 2019, the Korean government announced a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
The plan called for 65,000 fuel cell vehicles to be distributed (cumulative total) by 2022, and 310 hydrogen stations to be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price has been set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations, the core infrastructure, is 38% (about 117 locations) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is far below the target value.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Economic Organizations (Zenkeiren) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem."
According to the report, the fact is that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, which is the core material of fuel cell vehicles, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (USA), Gore (USA) and 3M (USA) supply membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020).
However, the Federation of Economic Organizations said, "In effect, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually ranked lower than other competing countries."
The ranking of patents by country is China, the United States, the European Union, and Japan.
The gap has widened since 2017, when China overtook the United States to take the top spot.
In terms of the number of patents registered in 2020, Korea ranked fourth with 1033 patents, surpassing Japan (974 patents), but at the 22% level of China (4,721 patents).
"hydrogen technology should be designated as a" national strategic technology "with a large tax deduction for capital investment and R & D expenses," the Federation of Economic Organizations proposed.

It's free competition, so if, for example, a brand-name item becomes rarer than the list price
For example, it's legal for a painter to become famous and raise the price.
The fact that the Ps5 is being sold at a high price is because it's rare, and it's only worth more than the list price.

Assembly reform underway in Takasu, MP's' report card ': Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique council reforms, such as the creation of an unusual flyer to announce regular meetings and the introduction of a "report card" that allows town residents to evaluate council members.
The town council election is the third consecutive election without a vote, and the aim is to get the town's residents interested.
On the 9th, about 1,800 new flyers were distributed as newspaper inserts to inform the public of the Sunday assembly on the 12th.
"morning Raw Gillon," "Tetsuko's Room," "Sawaguchi Jin Exploration Series..."
The leaflet distributed by the town council to all households on the 9th has wording reminiscent of the name of a popular TV show.
Katayama Hyoe (43), a member of the assembly who created it, said, "I want people to smile and come to the assembly."

U.S. aid arms and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, engage in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! news
(CNN) -- U.S. State Department officials reported by the 12th that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance program approved by President Biden.
The military aid, worth a total of $60m (£68m), will see the last of the equipment shipped to Ukraine at the start of the year, including four radars that can spot mortars and other projectiles.
The aid included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile, according to Pentagon spokesman Kirby.
The military support is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's national defense capabilities in response to Russia's troop buildup near the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. has grown wary of Russia's moves and is consulting with NATO members to figure out what to do if Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
Biden had approved the weapons aid when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House on September 1 this year.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine has reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has reached more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, it deployed the U.S. National Guard from Florida under a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
U.S. special operations forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held a virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, which included a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

Amari Akira, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission, on the future of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes gift giving "prohibited" while alive!
The first feature in the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Family Talk During the New Year's Holidays!
It's the art of gift-giving and last-minute inheritance. "
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, it was postponed in the 2022 tax reform outline, which was a concern, but in the near future, there is a great possibility that gifting during life, which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand."
How will inheritance rules change?
Along with a direct hit on the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission, Amari Akira, a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifting and inheritance to tax-saving techniques in order to make a great last-minute gift before the end of the year.
(Miyahara Hiroaki, Diamond Editorial Department)
"from the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with a full-scale study to establish a tax system that is neutral in the selection of the timing of asset transfers."
A sentence in the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year caused a major stir not only among the wealthy, but also among the middle class.
This is because what they are trying to say is that they are going to drastically change the rules of inheritance and increase the amount of inheritance tax by making "gifts before death," which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, a "forbidden hand."
The ironclad rule for tax-saving measures in inheritance tax, which is highly progressive, is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation."
The strongest trump card, gifting during one's lifetime, has been widely used not only by wealthy people, but also by company employees who are subject to a small amount of inheritance tax because they have homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
In the midst of all this, the debate over the "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.
Although it was not included in the FY2022 Tax Reform Outline announced on December 10th, which was feared to be the fastest introduction, the policy towards unification was announced again with more in-depth language, such as "the current inheritance settlement taxation system and calendar year gift system will be reviewed" and "the gift tax exemption measure is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit (snip) and will be constantly reviewed."
In an interview with this editorial department, Amari Akira, former secretary-general and former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Research Council, said.
"the most important thing is to lose the advantages and disadvantages depending on the timing of the transfer of property, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when you go.
At the moment, we are running a simulation to see what kind of problems will arise (from the unification). "
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future there will be a major shift towards invalidating gifts made during one's lifetime as a tax-saving measure.
So how exactly will the inheritance tax and gift tax rules change?

"my Righteous Brother" terrestrial broadcast from January 10, 2022 Furukawa Yudai "Please look forward to it!"
FOD's original drama "My Righteous Brother," starring Furukawa Yudai, will be broadcast terrestrially on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10th, 2022.
[photo] Yamaya Hanazumi playing the heroine Based on Moriesatoshi's manga of the same name, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE ・ LOVE" since 2018, this is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who are burdened with the past.
Furukawa plays the main character, Kairi, and Yamaya Kasumi plays the heroine, Riyo.
Riyo, a university student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia on a daily basis, is a mysterious young man who somehow manages to sleep soundly when he borrows Riyo's shoulder.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who bears a resemblance to her older brother, who was separated from her after her parents' divorce, but doesn't Kairi turn out to be a murderer?
Comment from Furukawa Yudai The drama "My Righteous Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10th!
For those who couldn't see it on FOD, I hope you will look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, I think you will get to know this work more deeply if you know the development and see the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Riyo, and the state of the two people who struggle and change.
I hope fans of the original will also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

[NFL] The team that won with three passes in one game What did the players feel and how did they feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! news
In that game, Jones threw only three passes for the Patriots.
That was the fewest passes in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills recorded two in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bills had a prodigy running back named O.J. Simpson, who surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time around was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and its latitude is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at 18m, and there was a blizzard before the game.
The Bills, being local, didn't make many changes to their play selection.
He passed 30 times and ran 25 times.
Allen's passing was 15 / 30 for 145 yards.
He didn't have an interception, and he wasn't bad.
There were scoring opportunities, with four red zone incursions in the 10 offensive series.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three innings, they were only able to score three points on one FG.
The defense in front of the goal in the final minute of the game.
Chasing four points, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd-and-9 to make it 3rd-and-14.
It is 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd-and-14, QB Allen came out of the pocket and drifted to the right, surrounded by a rush from the Patriots defense.
He then attempted to throw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
On that play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was outside right, was free in front of the end zone after running a shallow across, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.
On 4th-and-18, Allen attempted a pass to WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from outside the left, but the pass fell short when it was tapped by Patriots DB Miles Bryant.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bills WR Cole Beasley when he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley to respond to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw passes in the end zone on both occasions.
The pass on the 4th down may have been decisive, but on the 3rd down, there was no need to aim for a TD.
All you have to do is get a first down on two plays.
Since it was still 2 minutes before, Allen's ability to have his own run should have been alive if he had made it to 4th and short.
Her hair is shiny and put together.

Three items that tend to stay in the kitchen for a long time, when it's time to throw them away and replace them (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! news
Sponge
No matter how often you change your sponge, you're probably not changing it as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can harbor a lot of bacteria, even if you microwave them every day (though it's still a good idea to microwave them).
The German researchers behind the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture notes that cutting boards should be replaced if they begin to wear out, become scratched or grooved.
This is because once the wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean and bacteria can grow.
If you're still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in a gallon of water.
Dip the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and allow to dry naturally or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken tableware
It may be gut-wrenching to dispose of your favourite mug, but a chipped surface can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
It can also cause you to cut your lip where it's chipped or spill your drink.
Yes, it's your chance to buy your new favorite mug!

I thought the BIOS was damaged and tried to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't work at all.
According to MSI's blog, it will end in about 5 minutes, but it won't end in an hour.
The possible cause is that the USB memory that I tried is too old and the SD card is converted and used
Either he's sleeping too much and tomaho's gone.
Is there anything else that could be causing this?
Don't you like a man who always has a straight face?
Ah! there was an acquaintance.
He always looked like a Vagabond.
He didn't really hate me.

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to have brand-name products.
You can have it if it's inconspicuous, but you can't have it with a monogram that says Lv on it like Vuitton.
Why is that?
I think it's good that it suits your length.
By the way, if it's Japan, I think it's good.
In Japan, it is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it early, "Why am I the only one calling you out / talking casually?"
So if you start to think that it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, it's better to simply say that it's uncomfortable.
I don't think he's ever dreamed that there's a fair chance he's uncomfortable.
I was living abroad on the way, but there were a lot of Japanese people who went outside, including me, who came because they didn't like the Confucian customs of the upper and lower classes, and they misunderstood that they could say anything to the locals because they were out of line.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you're doing it with a kind of sweet or friendly feeling, not a pure offense.
Even my friends in the West call me by my first name, but when I speak in Japanese, there are times when I'm a little confused about which one to use.
Well, it's still good if you're friends.
I guess it's purely normal at first, but if you overlook it, you might not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because you're a gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Since it's Japan, could you please speak according to Japanese rules?
Henshu: it doesn't matter, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if I do that, younger and older people won't look down on me, or treat me like I'm Japanese.
Japanese people (myself included) are shit at looking at details like that regardless of personality.

Thank you for 50 subscribers!
When I opened reddit today, this sable that I just made had over 50 subscribers.
I'm really happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to get to 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today alone, so I'm very grateful.
If you subscribe to this sable today, I would appreciate it if you could tell me where you found out about this sable in the comments! (I don't know, so I'm really curious)
I'm the only one who's currently doing it, so I'd appreciate it if you guys could do it too.
Even if you don't make a thread, it will be encouraging if you make a comment.
Maybe people use reddit but not many people use twitter.
If you are using twitter, please set up a thread as well!
Last but not least, thank you so much! the sable I made before didn't attract as many people as I would have liked, and I was frustrated right away, but thanks to everyone, I think I can continue without being frustrated this time.
We will do our best to make Sable easy to use by maintaining the wiki and rules, so please continue to support us!

Oh well, please let it go!
I only understand a little bit of English, so I only judge based on the translated text.
I think the translated text is at a level where I feel a little uncomfortable with the text, but I understand what I'm trying to say and it doesn't hurt to play (I just feel this way, and I think it's better to ask others)
I often see this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel that for a small company, it's a good translator.
I think it's important for non-native Japanese speakers to be able to understand the subtle nuances of Japanese, even after studying for a long period of time.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people don't feel uncomfortable with, I think you should look for someone else.

Consideration "Kimetsu no Yaiba" training is the battle.
"equal exchange of effort" is a hymn to humanity < Commemoration of the start of the anime "Yukaku Edition" > (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! news
What makes "Kimetsu no Yaiba" particularly different from other recent boys' manga is that "there's a lot of training."
It is an established theory that the training edition, which generally has no battles and trains day in and day out, is not popular with readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in the same jump manga, "One Piece," when the Straw Hat Crew were separated, they had two years of training, but they only drew the touch and skipped the rest with gusto.
Well, one of the charms of the one piece is the eccentricity of the place where it travels, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
Well, it can be said that the training of Tanjiro, the main character of "Kimetsu no Yaiba," began when Tomioka Yoshitake, who saved his life, got down on his knees and begged for the life of Tsuzuko, who was about to take his own life, and was told by Yoshitake, "Don't let anyone else have the right to kill or take your life!"
The weak have no rights or options, they can only be defeated by the strong through force....
With that in mind, it was the kindness of Yoshitake that introduced Rintaki Sakonji, a "trainer" who trains those who wish to join the demon squad (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
Tanjiro's first contact with Rintaki was when he was asked, "What would you do if your sister ate someone?" when Tanjiro was stuck for an answer, he said, "Your judgment is slow," and fired a shot.
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that's talked about even among fans.
However, walking with her sister, who has become a demon, carries the possibility that there may come a moment when she will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that it is an initiation into training from the state of mind.
However, he takes Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri, and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air on the mountain is thin and full of traps, catapults, and traps, and I feel like I'm going to die before I even start my training.
Still, with his keen sense of smell, he is able to sniff out the faint scent of traps that have been planted by human hands, and somehow avoid them, which is barely a "hero correction."
Still, it's the essence that makes Kimetsu Kimetsu that makes Tanjiro say, "That doesn't mean that my physical ability will suddenly become so high that I can avoid it all of a sudden!!"
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any backing, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills they have honed up to that point" to their true potential.
The "Equivalent Exchange of Effort," which rewards only those who make an effort and nothing for those who don't, is a human anthem that is different from demons that have unfounded paranormal powers, and it is an unmovable rule that is consistent in this work.
Is this old?
It's not a bed yet, it's a way of sleeping where you lay a mat directly in the house and sleep on a mattress and a comforter.
Because the house is not an apartment.
That's what I do too.
If you have a large room, it's better to sleep on a futon rather than a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Are you obsessed with it?
People who work part-time and want to work full-time at other stores are greedy?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, I don't think it's "gamey" as I think.
I think it's "obsessive" to try to get more profit than effort with the least effort.

Korea's Samsung Electronics establishes "DX division" integrating consumer electronics and mobile, "emphasizing user experience" (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! news
Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided on the name DX (Device eXperience) following the integration of the CE and IM departments as a set department, and that this will be reflected in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be read that the intention is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the DX division, which was newly established by merging the CE and IM divisions, will consist of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience) and networks.
"the name change reflects the company's medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and global leadership," a Samsung Electronics official said.
He added that the intention was to make it easier for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through services and solutions that reflect their needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones and telecommunications equipment.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the name also reflects the company's strategy of creating company-wide synergies across organizational boundaries and building a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council, Samsung Electronics is already planning a strategy that will allow users to freely access content and services through the interconnection of devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

It's a bit unnatural here.
Hanmyo larvae lie in wait in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, and only their disc-shaped heads can be seen through the sand.
I think it should be.
I'm curious.
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
Are you looking at it from an ant's point of view?
Or is it?
If you translate "armoured heads" as "disc-shaped heads," I think the part that says "on the scale of an ant, it's a behemoth wearing a helmet" would disappear...
Aichi 24-car crash: trailer driver has no chronic illness, careless? (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! news
The driver of the trailer that was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, in an accident in which 24 cars collided, had no chronic illness, and it was found that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, leaving 12 people with minor injuries.
Police arrested 54-year-old Nomura Katsuya, who was driving the trailer, on suspicion of first causing a rear-end collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and sent him to a prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to move forward without stepping on the brakes after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to those involved in the investigation, Nomura did not have any pre-existing medical conditions, and it was determined that it was due to some kind of carelessness.
Police are searching the homes of those involved and investigating the circumstances at the time in detail.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! news
The 20th Chojin Olympics, which started in volume 3, will be completed in volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted everything from the opening match to the semifinal match in one go, this volume is full of new tricks because it focuses on only one match!
"Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Reviewer Name Oginuma X ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Chojin Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are carefully and carefully depicting the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first of all, I would like to point out that this is not a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
It started with the signing ceremony, and then there was the tug-of-war between the two teams and the special training, so it was quite a change from before, and we didn't go to the games, but it wasn't boring.
This feeling in the story, where the tension is gradually increasing as the battle of the century finally begins, is definitely connected to the heightened tension of the reader, and I am impressed that even this period is a really calculated production.
And before the important final, there's one more thing you can't miss: the 3rd place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Not only is it gorgeous as a match card, but what I like is that before the match, backstage, Ramen Man turns to Kinnikuman's poster and says, "From now on, it's my turn to aim!!"
And he tries to hit the chop.
However, Terryman, who happens to be passing by, catches the sword and stops him, and they stare at each other silently, and the scene ends with just that.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and there's no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.
But there is such an agony over that Kinnikuman.
When I see something like this, I can't help but think about what they will do in the distant future!
As a manga artist, it's a scene that still makes me keenly aware of what it means to have a character stand up!
Such a fight between the two ends without much of a break, but the famous scene is Ramen Man's tearful appeal after the match.
Directed at Kinnikuman, "Don't just rely on the strength of divine luck!!"
That's the line.
This is a grand meta-statement about the work itself, and I think readers have felt that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character after all, and that he is somehow winning in areas that are not his ability.
But by letting Ramen Man make this statement, Yudetamago sensei got ahead of himself and told him that he couldn't use that hand anymore.
With this one sentence, the reader asks, "So Kinnikuman is going to beat Robin with his own power?
How? "
From another writer's point of view, this is a line that Yudetamago-sensei, who makes the work, has imposed on himself.
I thought this was an amazing thing to do.
I think it's definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter illumination weekend held Takahama-cho Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! news
The first winter illumination has begun at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination, which began on November 26th, features a 20-meter tall camphor tree, as well as 50,000 LED bulbs scattered along walking paths and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there was such a place.
It's so beautiful and I'm relieved. "
The illumination was planned for the first time to give people a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and it will be lit from 5pm to 8: 30pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25th.
There will also be a Christmas event on the 25th, the last day of the festival, where button pots will be served and a movie will be shown.
I think there's only so many people who can read through a document in order.
I have a friend who can read a lot, and when I asked him, well, he was the one who could do it, but he was steadily building up from the basics of Linux, and he read the table of contents in a reference book rather than a document, and read it from where he was interested.
(in fact, it's easier to apply and understand if you learn from Linux rather than suddenly touching something with a high level of abstraction like docker.)
It's pretty tough to pull that out and suddenly understand everything.
I wish I could understand..
You don't have to do it in order.
Also, they don't remember the contents, they just remember the parts they skipped before and read them when they need to.
I didn't read anything and suddenly destroyed it with practice and then read it over and over, so I gradually started to read.

Online distribution and promotion of agricultural and livestock products: Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association relays from Yonezawa | Yamagata Newspaper
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which is made up of municipalities and JAs in the Okitama area, carried out PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," in which products are sold while streaming video over the internet.
Yamagata Ai no Bushotai made a remote appearance on "National Collaboration MINATO (Minato) Market TV," which was planned for the first time by Minato-ku, Tokyo, and delivered the charm of the region along with specialty products.
The "Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project," a collaborative effort between the Okitama area and Minato Ward, led to the decision to open a store, which was broadcast live from Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa.
Kuroda Mika, who is active as a "Satoyama Sommelier," wore a stole from Yonezawa textile brand "nitorito" and introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
He also reported on the imoni party with the Ai no Bushotai.
At the Tokyo studio, Kawamura Emiko of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and more than 300,000 registered YouTubers will sample Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, and more.
When the deliciousness was conveyed to viewers, comments such as, "Even though it's a live stream, you can feel the smell," and "There are so many delicious things to drink, it's the best" were exchanged.

I had some bad luck this morning.
My NAS PC won't turn on
What Happened
1.) Open windows in the morning for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is energized.
2.) When I came back to the room after a while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from the PC and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan was only slowing down due to the drop in room temperature (6 ° C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) It doesn't start.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is turned on for a moment and the fan moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I won't say anything.
I pulled out the power plug and tried again, but it still turned on for a moment.
4.) I connected only the motherboard and the ATX 20 pin and 4 pin, removed the other parts and tried it, but it didn't start.
5.) I suspect the PSU is the cause because I've been hearing a buzzing sound from the PSU fans as if they were hitting something.
I will try to find a spare ATX power supply at a later date.
Maybe.
If it doesn't work... what should I do?
Or change the case and mother together...

Top emoji used in 2021 (Gizmode Japan) - Yahoo! news

Recently, there are many messaging apps and chat tools that allow emoji reactions instead of stickers.
Speedy, easy, no need to reply, soothing factor.
Emojis are a must for the soft atmosphere that is so useful in modern communication!
So, I wonder what kind of emoji everyone is using.
[see all images] Top 10 most used emojis in 2021 Top 10 most used emojis around the world in 2021!
Overall, positive and upbeat emojis rank high.
According to Unicode, the source of the story, 92% of the world's internet population uses emoji.
In first place, it accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
The crying and laughing emojis in 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are really easy to use.
When it's funny, when it's happy, of course, I did it!
There are many people who use it in a self-deprecating way even when they feel like they can't do anything about it.
On the other hand, if you've never used one of the top 10 emojis, it's the rarest of the rare.
I want them to stick to that style.

How do you dispose of computers and peripherals?
* Computer farm
I've brought it in once, but even though it's in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, they don't collect it for free from Saitama Prefecture.
(if it's relatively new, it's free)
* InverseNet
I've never used it, but Sagawa seems to be completely free with cash-on-delivery shipping.
I'm thinking of using it, so if anyone knows about it, I'd like to hear about it.
* Oversized garbage, etc. (fees apply), additional notes > Local government collection boxes (small home appliances free)
* Sell second hand.
PostScript > Mercari, hard off
I wonder if there are people who sell at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It might be wise to sell it while it's still profitable.
* Postscript > Lynette Japan Information provided by: / u / CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers, old UPSs, etc. that won't be picked up anywhere are getting in the way.
It's not bulky, so it probably won't cost much, but it's kind of been put off.
I collect coins as a hobby.
If you know how much this coin is worth, please let me know.
The coins circulating in foreign countries are worthless...
In Japan, paper money is exchanged, but coins are not.
Commemorative gold coins are also valuable because they contain gold.
You don't like him even though he didn't do anything wrong, right?
Yes, it's natural to have likes and dislikes because we're human.
"I don't like something (for no reason)," that's what people who don't like it are like.

She can't do it, but is she discriminated against because of her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that it can be decided by appearance.
Because you can't show what's inside.
What did you do with your school uniform after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^ _ ^
I threw it away right after I graduated.
Yome used to wear loungewear until they started living together lol
Is it possible for a person to become a full rear at any time, even if they are over 90 or 100 years old?

If you are healthy.

Ryujin Nippon tops 8 for the first time in 29 years! Japan men's volleyball team advances to final T Coach Nakagakiuchi: "it was a big goal"

Fencing men's foil team loses to U.S. instead of winning Japan medal
It seems like they were in a different league than their opponents up until the semifinals, but why would such an opponent be in the third place match?
I would like to plant a tree in my garden that will serve as a blindfold, but if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
The hope is that it will be an evergreen tree that is easy to care for and, if possible, will bear fruit.
Thank you very much.
In order for feijoa to bear fruit, it is better to plant other fruit-bearing trees nearby, such as olives, blueberries and plums.
How much of each other's savings do you need to live together?
It's different for everyone.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It's better to stop living together.
There's a good chance they'll break up.
It's better to have a proper matchmaker, have a betrothal ceremony, go to this and that bridal party, have a wedding ceremony, and a reception.
There are no benefits to living together.
I don't think you should do that.
Today I went to a game center and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Gamba Rising.
Oh! I thought it was a legendary rare, but it turned out to be a re-recorded legendary rare (^ _ ^;)
Do you play card games like Gambarizing as a hobby?
I think it's ants.
