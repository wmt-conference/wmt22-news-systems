The app will help you equip your workshops. For points earned by moving
Equip the woodworking workshop of the Hodonín Integrated School with new hand tools. This can now be done by everyone who downloads the EPP Help with Movement app on their mobile phones.
"By your movement you collect points, which you then credit to our project account. You don't have to be a competitive runner or cyclist, the points are loaded even if you walk your dog or go shopping, go for a walk or walk to work," said Eva Schmidová, the director of the Hodonín school. The project was one of the most interesting among a huge number of other applications for the ČEZ Foundation. The application will only be active for one month.
The great return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough time in his career in recent months, is heading back to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalie for Litvinov, Plzen and Chelyabinsk in Russia was injured in preparation for the NHL this October.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he was substituted and has not appeared on NHL ice since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalie was moving from one stick to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to goaltending in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
He was called up from the farm on Sunday morning U.S. time, where he played four games and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he posted a 94.5% save percentage.
The Pilsen-born hockey player wants to finally prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
He had problems with his hips last year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "The Frenchman" has played 36 games and his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille's veil on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also posted his wish, using a photo of him helping his daughter Camille put on a veil at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
The wishes are sent to friends, associates and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte is also wearing a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared shirt, as are Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not specify who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The image, which serves as a Christmas card, was also posted by heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at Ascot Racecourse in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and face veil, helps Camilla put on her veil colour-coordinated with her bright dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminal investigators in a current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was promised CZK 1 million by Prague-based Slavia for the 2018/19 league title.
The server efotbal.cz reported this, adding that it had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, said that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt acts.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretaps, which mainly feature Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berber and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berber a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the first league title.
The police had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia's chairman Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial benefits to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdik.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was sparked by a police raid in mid-October last year at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer in any of football's positions.
Like former Vyšehrad sports director Rogoz, he was released from custody in mid-January.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the cold war.
The guns will be new, but basically of an inferior type (gunners have to get out of armored cabs and carry rounds by hand without cover).
The cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, plus they've managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent but at the end of their lease, transport- too small with short range but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we have none at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
SAMs: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
Technically a perfect mess with a weak scenario. Gemini with Will Smith did not outrage critics
Dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith takes on a younger version of himself in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on 10 October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute best in his field. He kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang up his career. Naturally, his employers don't like this, and send another hit man after Henry. The catch is that the assassin is Henry himself, or rather a younger clone of him created from DNA. Can one determined man win a fight against himself? This time, literally.
A sure guarantee of quality should have been three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. This may be his first sci-fi film, but he has plenty of experience with dramatic action movies, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tiger and Dragon and the western Ride with the Devil. Six writers collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. But according to the first reviews, even all this was not enough to make a good film.
"While Ang Lee tries to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Screen Daily's Fionnuala Hannigan.
"This underwhelming film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the filmmakers' technological wizardry," Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summed up his opinion.
"Gemini is a case where a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly frustrating action film," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"A confused product born of a bizarre idea," summed up IndieWire's Ella Kemp in her review of the film.
"It's hard to care that one man is a doppelganger of another when neither acts like a human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap website.
I have this story.
I have a chase right next to town.
There were nutria coming out of the river and doing damage to the crops, so I went there to sit.
When I walked in, I saw there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came up, but sure enough, a fox went after a while.
I let it come within 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman nearly shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got down from my perch he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a bummer.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging camera, which almost everyone has these days.
So get somewhere visible, put your expensive stuff in a sleeping bag at your feet and you should be fine.

The Interior Ministry got the respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of respirators, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases made by each ministry and found that in a single day the amounts spent on respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramatically?
Which ministries behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature-length documentary
This unique film by Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate a minute! It was and is a great honour for me to film with a man who endured more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary about Karel Gott, whose art has brought joy to three generations of listeners, as a commitment to this legendary singer," says director Olga Špátová.
The first day of filming took place on 22 October last year thanks to a quick arrangement and agreement, and the last shots with Karel Gotts were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his fans, as a painter, but also as a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in this country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has etched himself into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of Karel Gott's undisputed fame and achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film, The Gott Phenomenon, with this current one. Each is different. At least in the fact that we filmed them at a different stage in Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in the personal, almost intimate confession he gave us, which confirmed to all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The filmmakers captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at his cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's frank openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close-knit team, so that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, which allowed me to talk about quite intimate topics. With my husband, cinematographer Jan Malíř, they actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my anniversary. But since I still had a wonderful summer with my family, I wanted us to film for as long as possible. Well, and since I was all over the place in 2019, my wish was to have it released in theaters next spring. This documentary is a thank you to my fans and everyone who has supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself about the film.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We don't even have large stores of equipment for the trained to seize, we don't really have modern equipment even for existing professionals, plus modern equipment is getting more complex so the skills of reservists will rapidly diminish over time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts where anyone can deploy them will happen very quickly, there won't be time to train anyone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense is of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to lead a mass guerrilla, and a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
The only time we will fight on Czech territory is in a conflict of this scale and intensity, where a gerilla is irrelevant, and we don't even have the geography to do so.
XXX Lutz can buy Kiko's competitor, the authorities have allowed. But there's a catch.
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has cleared the merger of the competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other - subject to the fulfilment of structural commitments set out in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
XLCEE-Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it absorbed the Kika chain, it would have too large a share of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it has to divest part of the company it is buying.
XLCEE-Holding is also buying Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. The antitrust authorities have to approve the transaction there as well. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of Kika from Signa Holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is the number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by Austria's Signa, it had been owned by South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. The latter faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
The only ones. Reproduction is not certain, but we don't need to be scared
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even though they only convey the state of affairs. These include the word "only child". It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but it does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," one says, with nothing to add. Interestingly, this is a trait that "only child" has carried since ancient times, back when terms like "demographic crisis" were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no country in Europe today achieves this figure. At most, France and Sweden come close, but European countries do not have a simple reproduction rate. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with a fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation made for alarmism. "There are almost as many only children as two-child families," she told LN in an interview. But she left out the devil hidden in the details.
Yes, it is good when the problem is highlighted instead of being downplayed or ideologized. For example, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children can easily be labelled fascist (in the style of "that's what Hitler supported"). It's good to be reminded that many couples are directly planning for only children. It is good if politicians show a willingness to remove the barriers that lead to these decisions (for example, the poor uptake of working from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let's point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many only children", there is a grain of demagoguery. That statement was made twenty years ago. Let us recall that the last time the fertility rate in the Czech Republic ensured simple reproduction was in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it declined to an appalling 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost 50 per cent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. This is still not enough for simple reproduction, so politicians need to be active. They can only tone down the alarmism a little.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and tackling the housing crisis. It will buy 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing units that the city sold 15 years ago from a private Luxembourg firm, ADO Properties SA, for 920 million euros (CZK 23.8 billion). The move comes in response to public pressure, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rent prices. Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke) said it was the biggest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition has criticised the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and to give tenants security," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. The municipal firm Gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimates that it overpaid for the units by about 10 percent above their book value.
The German opposition Liberal Party (FDP) says the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation by their actions. The FDP said this in a tweet on Friday. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party called the move a "waste of money".
Already in mid-July, the Gewobag took back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not disclose the price at the time. The dispute over the flats on the former GDR-era exhibition street was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper said.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has become more attractive. Rental prices have doubled in the past decade, according to AFP, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
We mainly don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them play like they have it.
Then you watch a guy who missed an empty net 2 minutes ago go on the offensive alone between 2 or 3 Swiss and go, "what do you think is gonna happen now?"
Well, of course he's gonna get taken for the average taxpayer.
The "bring on the defender" situation is so horrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our striker managed to outrun one opposing player.
Wife swap: Ondra was brutalized by his parents! He ended up in an institution
It was nerve-wracking. Allegedly troubled son Ondrej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with his snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in Výměna. Dad Lukáš made little Ondra kneel in the corner for hours! Off-camera, he reportedly had to suffer like that on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and told me - auntie, I'm only making these troubles and remarks so that I won't be here, because I want to go to an institution," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the door of the studio apartment. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after the shooting and placed for a month in the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned briefly to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then he went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was mostly interested in whether we had received money. I hardly reacted to that at all. But then she texted me that the little one was in an institution, then they returned him to them, now he's in a diagnostic centre. They are both out of work," says Lucie, a mother from Plzeň.
Of course, Blesk also contacted the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," Aneta said and hung up the phone.

Prague Stock Exchange rose slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight growth. The PX index rose by 0.13 per cent to 1038.45 points. It was driven up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 and technology firm Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and media company CME did not fare well. This is according to the results of trading on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually ended with a small profit. "However, it (the PX index) lost slightly over one percent for the whole week," noted Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved 0.82 percent to 803 koruna and Moneta Money Bank 0.41 percent to 72.80 koruna. Shares in Avast rose 0.89 percent to 113 koruna and operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to 216.50 koruna.
Kofola's securities rose the most, up 1.38 percent to 294 koruna. Tobacco company Philip Morris gained less than a percent, with its shares rising to 13,640 crowns.
The securities of energy firm CEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
Three titles were losers - Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurer VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four cents against the euro to 25.85 koruna/euro, and three cents against the dollar to 23.62 koruna/USD. It follows from data on the Patria Online server.
The first swallows
Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal for the next weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time and, as is well known, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it may cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired through previous exposure to the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon also entered the covida equation this week on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalisation by a third and can be treated at home.
And it is soon to be complemented by Pfizer's paxlovide, which reports a success rate of 85 per cent so far.
But the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for the incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company also ended up on the tape first because the drug began development long before the current pandemic broke out, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for the viral disease in horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
In contrast, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beaks have grown".
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you without hesitation that they do not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Ono in France alone Le Pen and Zemmour, both polling over 20%.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables will open the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and the two acting award winners from this year's Berlinale, the directing award and the jury prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the Berlin, Venice and Cannes film festival. Once again this year, Be2Can will bring a selection of the most remarkable and thought-provoking work presented in competition at Europe's three most important film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the filmmaker Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The premiere of the film in Prague will be personally introduced by the actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga, who play the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit. Alexis Manenti also co-wrote the film's screenplay.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art Cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
Ladj Ly's feature directorial debut has been screened and awarded at many festivals around the world after its success at Cannes. It won the Best Film and Best Screenplay awards at the Durban IFF, and has also screened at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be screened in San Sebastian.
However, audiences can also look forward to Synonyms, Young Ahmed, Disruptor of the System, Goodbye My Son, Sorry We Missed You, Ghost Town Anthology and The Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh releases from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: the sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph The Painted Bird.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so the soldiers don't have to relearn where what is, so all the objects are exactly the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR didn't want nuclear warheads on their own territory, either for security reasons or the speed of warhead deployment due to the more westerly location.
Those underground shelters ( there are two in each maple tree) only held warheads not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy that weapon, a special unit came and retrieved that warhead and mounted it on some sort of launcher.
Except for the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate condition.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Ground Zero memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today at the end of a five-day visit to the United States at the New York memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. On this occasion, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"This is a very moving place," the Prime Minister said as he, accompanied by his wife Monika, laid a white rose at the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. The two were among the more than 2,750 people killed in the attack by hijacked planes on the former twin skyscrapers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, and a memorial with a list of names of the victims now stands in their place.
"We need to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The prime minister described the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States as a reason why the UN should work together in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists then crashed a hijacked plane into the Department of Defense building in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, presumably the White House or Congress. But this plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, this is where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech prime minister said.
In the second grade of primary school we had a classmate who was a gypsy, we were with him for four years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often came and wanted to explain things, he missed little, came regularly, played sports with us, didn't steal lunches or phones, came cleanly dressed.
He also went to outdoor schools, did all sorts of monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, his siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, threatening and menacing the other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something on an advert (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and have often sold to gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't make any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already signed it over to himself..
I say myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (working, working, not hitting women, just normal behavior).
But if someone comes along, reaches out, trashes apartments and houses, just messes around, makes trouble.. it doesn't matter what color they are, they're going to bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, as long as they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene despite resuscitation care," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was transporting the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot was probably driving in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, went into the opposite direction at a curve.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot ended up on its roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After being freed, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and was airlifted in a stable condition to the hospital in České Budějovice, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU parcels, customers often fail to provide details
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postage is often free," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and give the post office his customs details.
He receives an email telling him that customs is expecting a package to arrive.
He then just needs to fill in the details of the parcel and if the trader has not already included VAT in the sale, customs will charge it on the total amount of the parcel and the shipping costs.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
However, according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I tick one or two boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
But not all deliveries go smoothly.
Because of new customs rules, the number of daily shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, another problem is that people do not respond to requests to provide the information needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Strict, but fair, the clock keeps us entertained! That's how Benesov grammar school students see their favourite cantor, the writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school Czech and history teacher is also a poet, novelist and builder of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind over Pavel Hoza's texts. His poetry, his images. Bare trees, white-washed country buildings, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and the people who have walked them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor to Reynek teaches Czech language, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs the equivalent of Prague's Viola in the local Café na slovíčko and organises the annual Benešov Literary Festival.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or offset this growth?
For example, we see in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and petrol, do you think this is the way to go?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
For example, how much of a raise did you get (who is an employee)?
I got a 2% gross raise this year, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote by the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed a rumour that has been known for days: Canada is revoking the honorary citizenship of former human rights legend and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for her efforts to bring freedom to her country, has been stripped of her honorary title because of her involvement in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to strip Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago and senators have now unanimously backed it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," commented independent Senator Ratna Omidvar on her colleagues' decision. "We must make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada - even less so as honorary citizens."
The Canadian Parliament's verdict does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it sends a strong message. The silence of a long-time human rights activist on the atrocities that the military in majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months against the Rohingya Muslim minority is intolerable.
The fact that officially organised genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto Prime Minister of that government - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently brought to light by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should be brought to justice for crimes against humanity committed in actions which, the report says, 'are shocking both in the horror of their acts and in their sheer scale'. Suu Kyi and the administration she led, the UN said, were complicit primarily by covering up the soldiers' actions and releasing a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".
With Suu Kyi's removal, five individuals remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims, and Malala Yousufzai.
Developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy have also been reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile has been updated to include information on atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of her honorary citizenship. "We have also dimmed the light on her photo on a board depicting the timeline of the human rights struggle and are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesperson Rorie McLeod as saying.
Thus, in the current upheaval, the only thing that remains for Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her in 1991 at the suggestion of Václav Havel for her enormous contribution to the struggle for democracy. "While Ms Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten told Canada's CBS.

The Attorney General has reinstated the prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father over a long period of time. She was facing charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, but Zeman disagrees. His appeal to the Supreme Court suggests that such conduct may constitute a criminal offence.
The Supreme Court's decision could have wider implications for other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also in terms of guiding further application practice," Zeman's appeal states.
Last year, the district court in Svitavy initially found the woman guilty of both abuse of a ward and endangering the upbringing of a child. She had formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even when she was supposed to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalised. She had threatened to harm herself if she was handed over to her father's care.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years' imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offence. The regional court repeated the same verdict after the Supreme Court ordered it to decide again.
The Regional Court stated that situations where one parent manipulates a child against the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in custody proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth welfare authorities. Only rarely is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the Attorney General, the woman had committed both abuse and endangering the child's upbringing. "The accused acted quite purposefully in arousing negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and purposefully reinforced those negative emotions. In doing so, she not only pursued the unlawful intention to restrict or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must necessarily have been aware that this would have negative consequences in the minor's psychosocial sphere," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to send the case back to the regional court once more. The appeal states that the child is now in the custody of the father.

Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven convicted rapists are only put behind bars for even 6 months?
This just boggles my mind, how the court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for years, negatively affecting his/her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also discourage potential future rape victim reporting?
First Miss Christie finally came into her own: She dropped a few pounds, and she saw right through it.
The first modern Miss 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had for many years had problems with being overweight, which not only caused her physical problems, but mainly mental ones. She suffered from the fact that she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she has taken those criticisms to heart and has taken up the fight against the extra pounds. It's a long run, though.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But it's been 30 years since then and Ivana Christova can only remember the beauty pageant. Not only because of the fame, but also because of how thin she was.
As time went on, she decided not to conform to the strict modelling rules that required her to be as thin as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started indulging in whatever she felt like.
But she went from fasting to overeating, which immediately took its toll on her figure. She tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothes, which added dimension to her plump shape.
Now it looks like Ivana has really gone all out. She has visibly lost weight, started dressing tastefully and appropriately for her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone present at the book launch of Miloš Zapletal (75) by saying that she has seen through her looks again and has regained the features of the charming brunette who made history in 1989 not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will always be the first beauty pageant winner, but also the very first one who was booed like a madwoman by the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava when she put on her crown.
The renovation of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has postponed the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was 20 September, said Radek Drahný, spokesman for the national park. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is a reduction in the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits a bid that is acceptable, the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the museum's renovation is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a contractor selected for the construction part by the end of last year and to start work this spring. According to the national park administration, the CZK 123 million in European funding for the project is not in jeopardy.
The KRNAP administration has not been able to select a construction company for the museum repairs. It launched a second tender this summer because in the previous tender all the bids from companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of CZK 65 million. The bids exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. After the transformation of the expositions, a KRNAP visitor centre should be established in the now vacated building by the end of 2021.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exposition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful Stone and Life exposition, should serve as a representative gateway to the Krkonoše Mountains for visitors. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most comprehensible way and motivate people to explore and protect the mountains. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities to organise concerts, festivals, theatre performances or lectures in the open air. There are plans to build a new entrance to the building, a research room or a café.
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was the subject of an arrest warrant.
He called them to her himself.
But he took a roundabout way of doing it.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
The officers, after calling the emergency number, reached the spot and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made it all up so that the officers would come to the spot.
In reality, he only wanted the officers to advise him on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
On checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, under a nationwide search, and had a warrant out for her arrest.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not Slavic ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme of course, too bad Churchill couldn't secure the liberation of Prague for the US :')
Of course I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
The unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region.
Unexplained cases are called "memorials" in criminal slang. But even these are investigated if new information comes to light years later. Especially when the death of a child is discovered. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič managed to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí Valley, then already 12 years old. "A case from 1955? That will be difficult, very difficult. For a start, it would require finding a file that may no longer exist, talking to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really hard," Markovic said.
Under the previous regime, violent crimes were not widely reported to the public, but Markovic said that certainly does not mean they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminologist believes. The problem may be that material from the 1950s may be destroyed, although cold cases should not be shredded.
Tech firms want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama has been somewhat burned by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing ... is the final point in the ideological evolution of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, we are witnessing rather illiberal models triumphing and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thriving from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: the Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to counter these forces. As his interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he rethinks many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be brought back into the public sphere, and Marx was right in many ways. Though he also insists that his thought is still in line with the position of the 1990s and that critics of The End of History and The Last Man have misunderstood him.
"What I said even then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what the good life is. It leaves that up to individuals who feel alienated, who don't see the point, and so they band together in identity-based groups that give them a sense of belonging."
In its day, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a powerful argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked about how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we're talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear public services are demanded, I don't think it will work. But if you mean redistributive programs that attempt to address the huge income and wealth imbalances we are seeing, then yes. I think not only could it come back, it should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the fore, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama attempts to calm the current situation as well, warning all liberals that even the rise of new not-quite-democratic regimes will not be the end of history.
I don't know, it's quite questionable whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit them.
I personally wouldn't consider such a case to be a true belief.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should one choose then?
I'd say it's quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
After all, even the Ten Commandments say there is no god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god rather than risk choosing the wrong one out of those thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed will send me to hell or some such place for it?
The uncomfortable one wants $45 million from the state
According to spokesman Vladimír Řepka, the Justice Ministry has received six requests in this regard and is now analysing them. The young man was jailed for two years for assaulting the woman, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
Neither the Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor Justice Minister Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of the hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec state prosecutor's office accused Nečesaný, a 20-year-old student at a grammar school at the time, of the crime. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times on the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The woman was found seriously injured by her son and her life was saved by doctors at the Hradec Králové hospital.
Nečesaný denied any guilt from the beginning. "I am innocent and I swear it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny having been in the hairdresser's on the fateful day, said in court earlier. He said he wanted to get a haircut. However, he left after the woman told him that she was closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor when she questioned him, but later identified Nečesaný as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové Regional Court handed down five verdicts in the case. First, it found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison; the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Nečesaný went behind bars twice, but each time he was released after the Supreme Court intervened. After a change of the trial chamber was ordered, repeated acquittals were eventually handed down, the last of which was upheld by the Supreme Court in March this year.
At the same time, however, the president of the appeals chamber, Jiří Lněnička, said in his reasoning that the decision was wrong, but said he had no better option given the procedural situation. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict even though her appeal objections were justified.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but the evaluation of the evidence. We consider that sufficient evidence was gathered in the preliminary proceedings, which in another criminal case would have been abundantly sufficient for a guilty verdict," Lněnička said.
However, both the Hradec Králové and the Supreme Court viewed the case differently and their opinion would probably not be changed by further reversal of the acquittal.
Other: voluntary training followed by inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialties, X months per one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If one does well one can get a pro offer.
All branches of the Army could use something like that.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: There is constant mention of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only when we grow up, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
There should be a similar blending between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you see NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is trouble.
Oh, my goodness.
All it takes is one election in the US to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already proven that all they have to do is show their backs and they'll take what they want.
The only thing that works in the long run as a guarantor of independence is an armed to the teeth army and a population that knows how to operate the military technology of its time.

Kovosvit's selling the office building and the other halls. He's expecting worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, while consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Kuchař counts a lack of staff and shifts of subcontractors among the main problems last year. Demand for machine tools has fallen this year, down 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is linked to an expected drop in turnover of the order of 10 percent," the CEO said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of CZK 1.3 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally uses. This includes the office building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet fully. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to make Kovosvit leaner, more efficient. The sale of the assets is not part of some momentary solution, be it cash flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all our resources to investment development," the CEO said.
Kovosvit exports about half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, and to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, Kuchař counts India among the most interesting, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Another order in the same volume has been negotiated, which we would like to fulfil before the end of the year," Kuchař said. Kovosvit is facing restrictions on the Russian market and elsewhere due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a company that is a subcontractor to Airbus. It delivered another machine to it in May this year and is expected to deliver one more at the end of the year or in early 2020.
The company's main investment this year was a CZK 20 million switch from steam to hot water heating. Kovosvit employs 500 people and the average worker's wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting grinders for the foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Bat'a. The company had up to three thousand employees at the time.
Thank you for dancing! Singer Leonard Cohen's final album to be released posthumously
The album Thank You for the Dance will include unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, You Want it Darker, an album Cohen collaborated on with his son Adam, was released. He asked him to help him finish each song. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the material left over from his father. He brought in a number of musicians to collaborate with him - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas and singer Beck, to name a few.
"When we came up with the music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So he's still with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What impresses me most about it is the reaction of those who have heard it. One by one they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The album's first swallow is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his trademark honeyed voice. He was singing about death, sensing he wouldn't live to see the release of new material. He admitted as much in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in English as The Flame on December 31 by Argo.
How not to drown in the box tsunami
Unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're at home overwhelmed with boxes and stuffing?
This "waste" is once again being used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
That's why we've created a map of shops that welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it's a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to a participating shop (the KAMsNIM.cz map contains nearly 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overflowing blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and the money saved, as packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50% in recent years.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, this also strengthens their brand.
One of these shops is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brna by individuals who have accumulated them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use all of them for packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the app www.KAMsNIM.cz does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to dispose of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to drop off expired medicines, tires, old electrics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
This way, all the rubbish can end up in the right place, plus reusable items can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
"It gradually adds collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste", adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Ukliďme Česko association.
Managers of state-owned companies will now have to go through a selection procedure. The law can be circumvented, says the opposition
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary club.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies has approved changes to prevent the future opaque distribution of functions - critics talk of "trafics" - in state-owned companies. Candidates would now have to go through a selection process at the relevant ministry and will also be considered by the government's personnel nominations committee.
However, this is a compromise solution, which ODS, for example, does not like because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection committees are responsible for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the committee will not be binding on the minister. The amendment still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students don't understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron's presentation of the priorities of the French EU presidency - starting in January - before the weekend was spectacular.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they are impossible to do in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And France will hold new head of state elections in April.
The electoral calendar has affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticise Macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is more concerned to prevent history being rewritten.
The far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is now going around France saying that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is having some success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for a history book seriously and ignore what's going on in France.
Wouldn't there be a need for one?
Students in European countries are often taught history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated who in which battle.
But unless they have an enlightened cantor, they no longer learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" didn't win.
The story, which harkens back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for directing and best actress for Jasna Duricic.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it topped the audience rankings.
Best Actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the regular flu, it was worse.
I don't get diarrhea with the flu.
(Just a personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, to be published on December 20, will include the traditional literary supplement.

We are enclosing the book ones for you, the subscribers, in addition to this digital edition, so that you will have enough time to buy books as Christmas presents.
Prose texts that follow on from a previous similar collection by Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another serving of observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with unusual poetic insight, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose work, photographer Šesták has attempted to capture the essence of small towns and Czech society.
It is a story about a return to one's roots, which turns out to be a longed-for illusion.
The bohemian and comparatist translates the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood into the setting of a contemporary village.
Her rendition surpasses the folk versions in brutality and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the road back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental tale of return from emigration than we have become accustomed to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make it worth living together.
Kristyna Pliskova fails to reach the final, a second title eludes her
The environment in Tashkent suited Pliskova, she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit here in 2016, and she was very impressive this year as well.
After wins against Paolini, Kawa and Kuzma, she broke into the top four players.
But the match against Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristyna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Pliskova's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck went up 3:0 early and Kristyna was unable to turn it around, although she did manage to convert one break point. In the last set she fended off one more break point, but the second one was the end.
Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
An undated image shows Adolf Hitler visiting Czechoslovak border fortifications. The role of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies became involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have taken the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would have been none of these weapons, even though the Germans had overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks in them. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses - because of the blisters.
Zeman to be monument keeper - Man straining constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who are in a camp-divided society and don't want to go completely mad will welcome situations where they don't have to root only for their own. When he can also give credit to those he otherwise criticizes. If only so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to pre-assigned labels. Such situations include the list of badly damaged monuments that President Zeman uses during his favourite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it is. And anyone who occasionally wanders through the Czech Republic sees many of these devastated monuments - from the centres of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and estates - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagoguery can come into play here too. That if we accuse the town hall of not caring for monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatised building whose owner is untraceable. The head of state challenges local politicians: "A section of the Landmarks Act allows you to fine owners of buildings who don't take care of their property." But even if the owner is untraceable, it must be admitted that the president is calling for law enforcement. Which even critics of his Constitution-bending should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex issue. But he is standing up for a good cause, much like the squatters he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "For all the name-calling, the squatters draw attention to an issue that stands outside the current concern. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is de facto doing the same thing.
If you come to the historic centre of Jáchymov, you are amazed at how devastated it is - including the houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and the minting of thalers (dollars to Americans). Why? Because of a quick-fire sale of houses in the 1990s, local officials say. But why is it that Ostrov, seven kilometres away, the seat of the Šlik family who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has its historic core nicely repaired? It is good if the president draws attention to these things.
Trains are starting to run according to a new timetable, and in some places the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains on the railway will start running according to a new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route will be slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, ČD plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections daily, of which 478 will be long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services, the new timetable will also see the railways running services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be deployed in northern Moravia and western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
Railways take inflation into account in their fares every year.
The biggest change in RegioJet's timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will be replaced by ČD here after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 daily services on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the journey times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned closure works.
The operation of trains of Arriva and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change trains on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of ČD.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare.
As with ČD, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil and die.
I've never in my life heard teaching from the slave party's perspective or from that time, no one is advocating this, just condemning it.
No one even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
No one teaches you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, right in the schools, both the more northern schools and the southern schools.
I haven't come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I've heard it happening before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are pretty taboo).
My point was more that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to pass judgement without the perspective of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good accomplishments of their own, and I find it absurd to dismiss them.
Plus, the North wasn't much better than a lot of people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder, and a lot of things went against them too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately leave out some facts, lie and manipulate, plus for example our perspective doesn't exist with them (there was even a video on YT where they shut down someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, those students were pretty radicalized and the schools encouraged them in so many ways.
And to think that these people are going to be a lot older someday, it makes me a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it should have and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's become radicalised.
Nowadays, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are labelled as feminists, so are other groups like LGBT, and it leads to radicalisation on the other side too, where it often leads to resistance even on quite sensible things.
Plus the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I haven't come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery either.
More like I encountered bad geography, but that was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Plus, I find the concept of nationality in general to be useless in terms of any personal identity.
If I have anything in common with people it is interests, world views and shared experiences, not where we were born.
Police have charged CzechTourism manager Ales Pangrac over promotion contracts
Police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Ales Pangrac, over promotion contracts. Pangrác confirmed to SeznamZprávy that he accepted the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers were investigating contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Police said some of the money was going back to Pangrác, the server said. In the case, detectives were also interested in Regional Development Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO), under whose ministry CzechTourism falls. According to the server, the investigation into the case is still ongoing.
Detectives from the National Centre against Organised Crime secured evidence in the case in the second half of last November. They have been to the headquarters of the CzechTourism, the Czech Ministry for Regional Development, the Most Autodrom and the Sport Invest agency. They also took a service computer from the minister's apartment. The court order for the search of Dostalová's home, which was previously quoted by ČT, stated that in 2016, when she was deputy minister, the minister made decisions about CzechTourism's spending in favour of selected persons indirectly and outside of standard official procedure. At the time, Dostálová said she felt absolutely innocent, she had not made any mistakes, she could document everything and she was cooperating fully with the police.
According to the agency, this was misconduct by an individual. The media had previously reported that the former director of the Regional Partnership Department at CzechTourism, Ales Pangrac, had been dismissed because of the audit results. It showed that CzechTourism had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I was accused. But I don't want to comment any further," Pangrác told Seznam Zprávy North.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, prepares second generation Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in the world, it still put it on the menu. Not a completely standard one, the customer really had to target this car, but no one else was offering such an option at the time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Indeed, Toyota still believes these cars have a future and will match hybrids in price within a decade. Of course, this is linked to the development of refuelling networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often mentioned in connection with the need for environmentally friendly operation, not of passenger cars, but of large tractor-trailers, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to cover long distances on a single refuelling. Pure battery versions cannot offer that. Thanks to its vast experience and long development, Toyota could find new markets.
It remains to be noted that, like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion and now offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.
There are up to 60 times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more abundant in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and it says the situation is even more serious than humanity has realised.
The study is based on field research in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists replicated a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, there are "ten to sixty times fewer insects in the rainforest today." This is a decline in the entire population, not in the number of species, and the survey covered all arthropods, not just insects. Because of the insect die-off, the population of other fauna that depend on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs and lizards, is also declining.
The authors of the research link their findings directly to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the rainforest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become a driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. The study thus shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought, according to the authors.
The report was the subject of a major story in the Washington Post on Monday, which gave the new findings a hyper-alarming headline. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whom the paper quotes as an independent expert, told the paper.
The insect die-off is also affecting Europe. "In our country, the decline is also of the order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. However, he says that in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it has just been running for a significantly longer period of time than in Puerto Rico," Čížek adds to explain why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the rainforest compared to the 1970s.
Nokia sues Brno firm over Lokia name. People won't confuse us, Moravians believe
Nokia has filed an opposition to the Lokia trademark application with the Industrial Property Office. However, according to CCV, confusion of products is unlikely.
Brno-based software development firm CCV is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns do not like the fact that the Brno firm's warehouse management software is called Lokia WMS, the E15 daily reported. Nokia has therefore filed objections against the Lokia trademark application with the Industrial Property Office. CCV believes that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrasek said that two dozen customers are already using the programme, which has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a trademark that we believe may lead to confusion or dilution of our brand, we take action to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
The Brno-based developers say they did not have the brand, famous in the past for its mobile phones, in mind when creating the stock programme. According to CCV, the name Lokia is based on the Latin name for a species of dragonfly whose rapid movement is meant to be analogous to the movement of warehouse workers through a warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really targeting the mobile phone manufacturing sector. And we don't want to be compared to a brand that may be missing the train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák told E15.
CCV applied for brand protection with the Industrial Property Office in August before the program was launched. "It applied for protection for goods and services belonging to classes 9, 35 and 42, as software belongs to class 9, related business management services in warehouses belong to class 35 and computer software development belongs to class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's opposition is based on the fact that Nokia's earlier trademark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services, and thus naturally overlaps also in classes 9, 35 and 42. "The CCV does not dispute the opponent's claim as far as the coincidence on these classes of products and services is concerned. However, in reality they are completely different marks aimed at different target groups," Ondrášek said.
According to E15, brand disputes can take months and can complicate a company's operations.
I'm not a believer, but from what I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovakian parish priest is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always yells some bullshit about the coronavirus that puts everyone to shame.
Then of course there's the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they're Protestant, but in reality they were born out of Catholic Modernism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to services with the Hussites because it's theologically very similar, but the members tend to be more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square is under the Dominicans and they even do a Mass there every Sunday at 3:00 pm in Latin, like they did before Vatican II.
The crib from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flamingo lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The Scouts did not go to Vienna to get it this time because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Breclav.
They also took it at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the troop, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, the scouts take the train to Vienna to collect it.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
Traditionally, the scouts set off with the Bethlehem light by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, 18 December, by Scout couriers who will travel on selected express and passenger trains.
Local Scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations and will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic, even where the tracks do not lead.
Also this year, the Scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
This is similar to last year.
We are giving recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear veils, of course, try to keep the spacing as low as possible, not to sing colleagues, just behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and tranquillity along with the flame.
For believers, the Bethlehem Light is a symbol of hope, of light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been spreading it for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can pick up the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics background, so I don't know the basic economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer on the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology(e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces a useless product and it crashes the free market and the "natural life of a company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-funded by xy project" signs in the corridors and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't supporting a company that gives jobs to x people, this is holding back development when that company is somehow holding on and taking contracts/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's demise
Purposeful slander? The zoo's looking for a new vet, no one's interested.
Last seen later this month. The city's management attributes this to rumours that have been circulating around the zoo's former director and vet Václav Poživil that he was killing exotic animals he was taking care of on purpose. For example, the female rhinoceros Zamba, the elephant Kala or the orangutan Ňuňák.
The city council therefore issued a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of performance of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the city's Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of performance of CZK 2.8 million excluding VAT," said city spokesperson Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it an outrageous dishonesty of such a high-quality professional," she noted.
She said there are very few experts specialising in exotic animals. "It is certainly not a pleasant thing. Meanwhile, the zoo is providing veterinary care through orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "But the zoo has to comply with the law on public procurement as far as financing is concerned," zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská explained.
Václav Poživil himself is a respected expert. For example, he took part in a unique operation in which the cheetah Jane from Ústí nad Labem received the world's first total endoprosthesis. He served as the zoo's director from 2009 to 2012. He has not commented on the anonymous defamation of his person. He did not take phone calls or respond to text messages yesterday.
As for the zoo contract, some zookeepers believe that the zero interest in it may not necessarily be due to fears of such purposeful accusations as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, Jiří Král, a veterinarian in Ústí nad Labem, has not heard of it yet. "This is the first time I have heard it from you. No one has approached us. I think this kind of thing will spread quickly," he said.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age (translated as M*dat Age) calendar, Simona Krainová released her latest photos of herself completely naked! "I was a bit afraid that people would judge me for taking pictures of myself naked at my age. I'm a very shy person. But so far I've had only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, you can have a firm figure even at 46. Of course, there is hard work and sacrifice behind it, but there is no other way."
"Lukáš Dvořák and I have taken about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'll be naked," the model confided to Blesk, who also came very naked to her christening.
She wore an extended jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she forgot her underwear. Running every day has firmed up her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. Her husband, her friends, even Lucia Bílá.
I totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age gets caught in a trick or trap too - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don't move me, but then I still catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always avoid it.
That's also why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament that currently want to put a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) ads...
It's all crap, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internets.
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, the mining company's spokesman Ivo Čelechovský told ČTK.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in the tunnel at a depth of about 1,200 metres. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. Bánsk rescuers immediately intervened at the site and eliminated the fire by direct intervention and also carried out a survey of the area. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South. Mining at the Lazy Mine is expected to end this year, while the other mines are also expected to gradually decline. OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, with last year's production of 4.62 million tonnes. About 9,000 people work in the mines.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mostly in) point 1:
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I will claim is cryptic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has bucked the trend of Christmas movies, with two hundred premiering this year
Los Angeles - Movie theaters, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies, premiering a record-breaking two hundred-plus of them to their audiences this year.
The operator of the IMDb movie database has done the math.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring points with audiences in recent years and has seen a significant increase in viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being made.
Four times more Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb only includes in its total those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so realistically there will be many more festive films.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales in particular are associated with the season, while popular films worldwide include Home Alone, Love in Heaven and the 1946 classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful.
However, the real boom of Christmas movies started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special series of films, the BBC reminded.
Its Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers in on 22 October and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, with popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't matter that much, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"It's a form of escape for the audience and a way to feel a little bit of peace, at least for two hours, in the midst of all the holiday madness and craziness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
He said Hallmark Television, for example, uses the same formula for its films, which, while uniform, is successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's some misunderstanding about a half hour before the end, but it's resolved and the two kiss.
It's like that over and over again, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he will not be involved in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for covid-19 and will not take part in the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place that he took in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin of Haas will not be racing in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher starting from last place and Max Verstappen from first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and showing no symptoms, according to a statement from the Haas stable.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
That's because any replacement would have to complete qualifying or drive in another part of the weekend.
The first driver is not struggling with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for covid-19 at the start of the season just ending, and last year Sergio Pérez or Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You can get arrested for that, too.
And nobody will give a shit that the boss said
Legally, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
In the same category as HIV, plague, hepatitis or typhoid.

(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph (1).
A pike in a pond or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš has chosen statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment, and low national debt for his optimistic view. Or the fact that our country is, according to a recent study, twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, also cited other, far from "rosy" figures. For example, that the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction procedures. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant construction legacy as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also a slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet managed to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, modern and fast travel, quality cultural venues, and to live without unbearable environmental burdens.
However, in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has been impossible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a rapid transit or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd tug-of-war over architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism that adheres to the slogan "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something bolder might be possible, it is almost certainly thwarted by the conservationists or other somewhat conceited associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new National Library building, even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the diggers.
But the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is unable to complete its motorway network or start building high-speed trains, so Germany finally decided to run its superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna via a "detour" through Bavaria. Moreover, repairs to existing infrastructure are often drowned in shenanigans. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a conundrum.
Babiš came into politics promising to "make things work". But in terms of meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened. An amendment to the law on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure has been in force since 2018, but we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects of, for example, easier land expropriation. And the new construction law, approved by the government, which is said to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people would probably not bet on it.

Declaration of the End of the Right in the Chamber of Deputies or What kind of "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
In the media and commentaries, there have been reports recently about the upcoming coalition of the above-mentioned parties. Many are applauding the fact that the "right" is finally getting its act together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter what the entities call themselves or what labels the mainstream media parrot. ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and so hypocritically labels itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that in its conception, ideology and electoral targeting is basically merged with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU even labels itself as centrist for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel I've taken everyone out of the same water? No, I'm basing it on the actual policy actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classically liberal right-wing voter, my highest value is individual liberty, free markets and minimal government interference in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wingness? How many laws chopping away at people's freedoms in a salami-slicing fashion, raising taxes, endorsing new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to the socialist EU, or promoting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingism.
I would not be surprised at all by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and, apart from the Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see any obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing party" and by associating itself with these three entities it is already revealing its true political alignment in a disingenuous way.
By the way, since I briefly mentioned the labels. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite uniformly and cheaply label critics of the dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can they not or just do not want to understand that there are many people who do not like Euro-socialism and growing unfreedom as much as they do the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not hiding their utter argumentative incompetence and their gratuitous or blind adoration of the EU?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic politics other than centrist politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Perhaps this is the kind of association the voters really want. Perhaps they want left-of-centre politics under the guise of 'right' because they are ashamed of their political convictions (or cannot even identify them). I don't know. But I am certainly not one of those voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Prindiš was fourth, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth in Friday's qualification. Three more Czech athletes will be in Spain to try to reach the semi-finals in the afternoon qualifying heat.
Vavrinec Hradilek failed to make it out of the strong group of national kayakers, receiving a fifty-second penalty for a misjudgement at the start of the heat. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal of making it to the top 30 in the first run, which I managed to do. It's not that I didn't care how I ended up, because Sunday starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a bit higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising his comfort in Seu. "Before the patrol race I felt the worst I've felt in the 14 days we've been here. But then during the race it was good and today it was better again. It's beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so it's good," he smiled.
Prskavec was also happy. "In qualifying you don't want to make any unnecessary mistakes. In the first gates I was not good at all. Then I drove the middle very well, without any problems and I knew I had mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go down the straight and I turned the wheel. Overall, I can't be unhappy. The form is there, let's see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both athletes praised the fact that they will go for the start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not an early bird, plus it's cold here in the mornings, and when you're here at eight o'clock, it takes a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Prindiš. "All in all, the semifinals take an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Prskavec agreed.
Of the three Czech women's singles canoeists, only Fišerová succeeded, with Eva Říhová finishing two places behind the top 20 and Kateřina Havlíčková 35th. "I did the upper part as I wanted, in the middle passage I felt like I was not keeping up and not going according to plan, but I managed to get into a comfortable track that I wanted to ride. I made two shuffles and I'm just behind the winner with a clear time. I have a good starting position for the semi-final," praised Fischer.
A hunter was injured in a fall from a sit, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before 7.30 p.m. in the top part of the mountain near Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with proper equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for the cooperation of the Moravian-Silesian Regional Health Service. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," described the circumstances of the intervention Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service.
The rescuers found the hunter in the selected locality with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty, transported him on a so-called Austrian trolley across the rough terrain.
"The transport over a route of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after about three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the chief in charge of the Beskydy Mountain Service and also an intervening rescuer, the hunter's colleague was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured was.
"We found him relatively quickly. However, if he had had the Záchranka app on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been with him sooner and the 155 dispatching line would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," Radan Jaškovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka app activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Step aside, Schiller urged Czernin for her words about opposition dirt
"I find it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such totalitarian language anywhere, let alone on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of a draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition could not muster enough votes and the draft constitutional action, which was presented to the Senate, was thrown off the table.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like how taxpayer money is being spent here, how empty straw is being beaten. And I'll even take the liberty, I'm not using harsh language, of quoting one of them: It's opposition and senatorial dirt," the finance minister said.
"The Nazis used these terms to denigrate citizens of Jewish descent and the Communists used these terms to denigrate their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for people and their opinions," Czernin, the vice-chair of TOP 09, wrote to the minister.
"I was quoting one of the many messages I received dozens of during the House proceedings. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dehumanization we witness daily in domestic politics, which was also the main motive for Thursday's House session. I am surprised that anyone would apply the term to themselves," Schillerová told the Czech Press Agency.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It's responding to a directive from state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which is seeking to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then have the bank pay the oil firm's suppliers in cryptocurrencies. The staff is also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies against foreign exchange reserves, which are now near a 30-year low. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
Sanctions imposed by the United States on President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has exacerbated the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different methods to move money around. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency have failed, the ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither the Venezuelan central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ether, nor how much value it holds in these currencies. The company has struggled to get payments from customers through conventional channels because large banks are unwilling to do business with sanctioned entities. Last month, the company received most of a $700 million (16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties were unable to find financial institutions to facilitate the transaction.
PDVSA may be reluctant to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require it to register with the exchange and undergo due diligence, so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank to pay the entities to which PDVSA owes money. Oil company officials believe that the central bank is less exposed to potential obstacles that could arise when paying with cryptocurrency.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are enabled without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are engaging in digital currencies because of the money laundering and customer information issues that come with them and complicate compliance.
Cryptocurrencies are experiencing a comeback this year after the debacle of 2018 due to expectations of greater adoption by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain volatile. Bitcoin is down nearly 20 percent in the last four days, but has gained about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It's clearly a compact SUV, but it doesn't offer all-wheel drive. That leaves this item to its larger Sportage sibling, which is a direct answer to cars like the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to these, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes that, by sloping down the rear, can remotely resemble the world of SUV coupes, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed can't just be placed alongside the plasticky versions of classic compacts, which include the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so those who don't want to may not see the Ceed in the shape of the newcomer.
Unlike the Ceed compact hatchback or wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a base atmospheric 14-cylinder. The XCeed starts with a supercharged litre and also offers a 150kW turbocharged sixteen, reserved for the sibling GT version. Don't expect a sporting gear here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesel is only offered in mild-hybrid form, meaning the combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps with fuel consumption and emissions. From 100 kW onwards, it is also possible to pay for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic alongside the manual.
The range will soon expand to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that can travel around sixty kilometres on electricity alone. The batteries can also be charged from a normal socket.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds.
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in my home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his piece over six months.
He bought the silk in Italy, the 24-carat gold thread in France and the 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk adds softness to the sweater," the designer praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If MZ is out of touch with reality, it doesn't matter much - he'll have the faulty circuit flipped and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that FB's departure from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under the influence is unlucky).
I think it would clean up the social climate quite a bit.
Possibly it would also clear up better the channels of "Soviet fraternal aid" to some of our political parties and leaders.
Then the people who vote for them would also be clearer about whose interests they really care about.
Too bad they don't own TikTok as well.
A lot of teenagers would suddenly be amazed to discover that the sun is shining outside too...
Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Plzen. It appealed against the two-match penalty
Football Sparta has appealed against the two-match punishment for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for the expulsion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letná club announced this on its Twitter account and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeals committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now seeking to get the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to start in Sunday's 11th round First League clash in Plzeň.
It could be a repeat of last October. Back then, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Simon Falta, who on Thursday was given a one-match suspension by the disciplinary committee for a sending-off against Liberec.
The appeals committee didn't have time to hear the case, so the punishment was postponed and Falta was allowed to start on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match punishment for the Olomouc midfielder the following week and Falta missed the next game against Zlín.
The disciplinary committee suspended Tetteh for a foul on Slavic player David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the opponent's captain Tomáš Souček was not proven.

Spilková v paru. In Indianapolis, she's on the verge of advancing after the first round
Golfer Klara Spilkova is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies and two bogeys at the LPGA series event and finished the opening day in par. With a score of 72, she is tied for 69th place, which is the projected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical layoff and did not make the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took time off due to fatigue and exhaustion from her illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is in her first year on the LPGA Tour and so far she hasn't done too well. She has made the cut three times out of twelve tournaments, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. So she is fighting to keep her card for next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round she has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over her three opponents.
Petra Cernocká changed her image and did well! She's rejuvenated her blonde hair.
Film Saxana Petra Cernocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her jubilee in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped it even more. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother, with her hair streaked with grey, wearing sedentary clothes and going out sporadically. She's always taken care of herself and the older she gets, the more she's able to let go of her image.
Fortunately, she hasn't succumbed to the plastic surgery trend and takes care of her skin with good old indulgence. And her anti-wrinkle prescription is paying off. But now she's changed her hair color and completely lost her mind.
When she arrived at a social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only was her hair lighter and shorter, but she was dressed in a yellow jacket that made her look even more radiant.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with their appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks 50 at most.

On the situation in the US with a leading African-American reporter.
New cases of police violence are coming to light in the United States, this time during a crackdown on nationwide protests.
Demonstrations that erupted after African-American George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest have opened up a debate about systematic racism, police work and incidents of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelova talks to one of the leading African-American journalists, The Atlantic magazine reporter Adam Serwer.
But what would increase that funding?
The Union is pumping money into us in subsidies.
If it stops doing that, we stop having that money.
I really don't see how the union stopping giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the grant money could be put to better use, but that's a whole other discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Pick the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine if you're the warm or cool type. Try a simple test - examine the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if they are green, you are a warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, the first thing to do is to sort based on undertone. Only next consider the texture.
If you are a woman with a cool undertone, then purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose lipsticks that are like that too. You can tell by the fact that they gravitate towards orange, coral, gold or brown shades.
You may find that some veins look green and others look blue. If that's the case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and can just focus on your colour preferences.

Still, quite often they don't give me a receipt or take it and throw it away.

The end of political trafics? Critics say the new law won't help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to absolve ministers of their responsibility to choose while they continue to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 MPs voted in favour. The law passed thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state companies will have to go through a selection procedure before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation for the minister binding. This ultimately failed.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD are concerned that the nomination law will favour ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind a decision of the commission and thus will not have clear transparent responsibility," SPD leader Tomio Okamura believes. Martin Kupka, vice-chairman of the ODS party, says similar things.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These would include criminal record, no debts, a minimum age of 25 years, and the main selection criteria should be professionalism.
The law will still have to pass the Senate and then be given to the president to sign.
The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
The engineers, scouts and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help their Polish counterparts protect the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in the wake of months of action by the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries into its territory with the false promise of easy crossings of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Police union chairman Stepanek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union Milan Stepanek has decided to resign from his post. Czech Radio - Radiožurnál reported this on Friday. Štěpánek had led the union since 2005. He will continue to be the union's chairman for two more months. He will remain with the police after his departure from the union.
"I can confirm that this week I have handed in my written resignation to the presidency, after which I will continue to hold the post for two more months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be tied to the union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said of his reasons for leaving.
The Independent Trade Union of the Police of the Czech Republic unites members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union has participated in police protests against budget cuts and petitions for better conditions for the security forces. It also got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister Radek John in 2011 and organised a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, maybe a reality
Sabre combines a conventional aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It's designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of Concorde. "When the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And the distance between London and New York, for example, could be covered in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which five times the speed of sound is exceeded, are complicated by engine overheating. But Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super-cold helium to prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about Sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and aircraft engine, powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets have not evolved that much in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft ones have. So if you combine the engines, you can have a very lightweight and efficient propulsion system and essentially create a space plane," he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights will then begin around 2030.
I have the heart of a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just take a few infusions, joked Zeman.
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the hospital's director Miroslav Zavoral, doctors found no "morbid conditions" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors checked the president and found slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low blood pressure were caused by insufficient hydration. "In order to fix the dehydration of my body, I will take several infusions to get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
However, he said the director of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral had received several hate messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So, a brief recap: the heart is beating like a bell, the lungs are clean as if he were not a smoker, the liver is working as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are also fine and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially during last year's presidential election or during some of Zeman's public appearances, during which he clearly has problems walking. According to Prague Castle, the president has difficulty walking due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and has difficulty hearing. He has cut down on smoking because of his health.
Only with a credit card on holiday? NEO account offers free ATM withdrawals worldwide!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have already got used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include convenience, security, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travellers in almost all parts of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more frequently, for example for work, don't have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even 'holiday makers' don't want to rely on cash to make ends meet. Moreover, some foreign currencies are not even available in Czech banks or exchange offices. Therefore, we have solved this with the NEO account so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs, wherever they are, free of charge," says Kateřina Petko, Marketing and Communications Director and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.
Moreover, a payment card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. If a full wallet is lost, its owner may never see the money he or she was carrying in it again. However, if he loses only his payment card, he can easily block it instantly by phone or through online banking. By acting quickly, he may not suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages besides its reliable protection. In the case of the NEO account, for example, the interest rate of 1.6% per annum is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It is set up and managed completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to EUR 100,000 and the maintenance of the account is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko.
Travel insurance should be a matter of course for anyone who is going abroad. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a credit card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with the embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries around the world. Holders of these cards can also insure the family they are travelling with. This often eliminates the need for any additional arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all the activities that the travellers plan to undertake.
Basketball players didn't win a medal at the U17 World Championships, they finished fourth
The American women won the third World Basketball Championship for 17-year-olds, beating Spain in the final 77:75 despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be a potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start but couldn't hold on because they outplayed us under the basket," regretted captain Karolina Maleckova. "But playing in front of such a crowd was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Plzeň.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two threes and dominating the court throughout the first quarter. At that point, it looked like they would avenge their 85:88 overtime defeat. However, the referees whistled 15 fouls in the half and with questionable decisions helped Hungary come back into the game with a 12:2 streak.
"I'm convinced that all we had to do was make two more three-pointers, run it to 20 points and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I don't care about the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent get caught," coach Richard Fousek assessed.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything go and fought to the end. The opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were kept in the game mainly by Petra Holešínská's accurate shooting from distance and Tereza Šípová's peacock shot. However, the top Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and was absent from the court for a large part of the third quarter. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they maintained, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"The first five games were very difficult for us, we turned the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Already against Spain we could see that the girls were tired and there was no place to take. We were not consistent on defense because of our physicality. We didn't play fast counterattack, we lacked rebounding. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win," Fousek added.
He believes his charges have a promising future. "In two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the 16-year-old European Championships and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, this is a quality team with good character and we need to continue to work with them and develop their talent. Now it's up to the federation to decide which coach to assign them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Omikron mutation spreading in South Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspected variant reported in another child from Adamov, from a preparatory class.
There is no direct contact with the previous cases from the Adamov primary school," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that the cases are two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases in Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of the cases have mild symptoms and four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected of having Omicron has travelled abroad
None of the people mentioned had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had there been any contact with anyone abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championships for any of those named, Ciupek said.
Earlier, chief sanitary officer Pavla Svrčinová said the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being investigated.
Players from South Africa were there and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict arms sales.
It wants to follow Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain guns in America's most populous state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after detecting the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court opinion upholding Texas' abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
But the court was now deciding not the constitutionality of the entire law, but a technical question arising from the measure's innovative design.
Indeed, the enforcement of the ban in this case was delegated to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in the usual court of law.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed Texas' ban on most abortion services to stand, and largely endorsed Texas' maneuver to protect its law," California Gov.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continued.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state legislature and the attorney general on a measure that would empower members of the public to enforce bans on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is a term for homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (more than CZK 220,000) and court costs from anyone in California who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for "ghost guns" or kits to make them.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," said California Gov.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban here in June as unconstitutional.
If the state were now to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict warned against extending that legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing select officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, where they gradually figure out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also make improvements to the vaccines themselves based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of the 4th dose are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, there will be a vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early to tell.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is expected to be on the market shortly, and according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises to be up to 10 times more effective.
The amount of teaching is safe to leave out.
But rethink what CO is teaching.
Our civilization and technology has advanced a bit since the days of Maria Theresa, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks doesn't make much sense anymore, and it's really a waste of time.
We could really cut back brutally on these things.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things they're going to need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is an online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and I pay for a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and internet providers.
Poland has threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
Ziobro said the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw down €36 billion from the EU's fund to rebuild economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also reconsider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes the Polish judiciary has undergone under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles", Ziobro also said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on rule by the most powerful and a Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would result in a reduction of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to give Poland the status of a colony," he said.
A homeless woman was killed under a bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to Prague police, the murder occurred sometime during the early evening to late night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police appeal for possible witnesses relates.
"Some of the drivers who were driving on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on Pod Krejcárkem Street could have filmed the murderer, for example, on a dashboard camera. A witness may have seen him and could have described him. In short, we welcome any testimony about this case and will take it on the 158 number," said Jan Daněk, spokesperson for the Regional Police Directorate.
According to the spokesman, the murdered homeless woman was unconflicted, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene of the crime. "She was most often in the vicinity of Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, carrying large blue shopping bags," Daněk said, adding a description of the victim that could also help any witnesses.

Mahulena Bocanova has broken her year-long detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Blesk that she quit alcohol. "During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my 50-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline of forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. I haven't been doing well mentally lately. I'm getting up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year's abstinence is said to have been enough and the actress has found her way to alcohol again. "Sometimes I'll have a bubbly or a fine wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun until the morning. I might have a bottle of wine in my fridge for a week. I also like non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink anytime," boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová has also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will be joining the Ordinace in the Rose Garden series. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I overreacted. But it's getting better," smiles the actress critically.
But to know herself... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yoghurt more than once too, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they had all the selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If there's an avoidance, I won't even go to any market anymore, no action, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
Lidl to take my holiday.

And I don't care anymore.
I've watched two years of data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little more out of touch than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion does take place on a professional level, but only extreme views make it into the public arena.
Wall to wall all the time.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colourful cakes instead of robust analysis.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way and we have it this way.
But the fact that the data collection methodology is different in the two states is not addressed.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day, y'all.
I was punished with a boil when I was a kid.
It was never for grades, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc).
At the same time I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" she would just bring the cooker and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a couple of whacks on my bottom (through my clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishment (when done reasonably and in moderation) is beneficial because the child responds to it much more than words.
I think the warning part is important, because in a way it gives the child the choice of disobeying and getting it, or getting better and not getting the punishment.
For me, in the end, mostly just the warning was enough to get me to listen.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, public memorial service on Sunday.
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media reports citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to bid farewell to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a memorial service at the Invalides in Paris, where Chirac's coffin containing his remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace said.
Crowds have been streaming into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign the book of condolences, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. Then on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a state of mourning.
Meanwhile, more reactions are pouring in from around the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as "a Frenchman in the true sense of the word".
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love of his country and the sport of sumo. The news of the former French President's death has appeared on the front pages of all the Japanese newspapers, including the sporting ones, the French press notes.
The museum of tribal art on Paris' Quai Branly, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
Defending the system
In 1999, when Vojtěch Cepl, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, answered a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether it was a sacred document sworn to and taught at school, or an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he was strongly inclined towards the former.
Once we have agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a country and its citizens, it is better to be sparing with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just like Czechs like pork and cabbage dumplings, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its authors (of which Vojtěch Cepl was one) could not have foreseen, for example with the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be well thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies across history have faced.
A constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians their power.
Covid does not choose, in the Brno hospital they are fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases, which hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novosti.
The course is usually much simpler, easier, and often without symptoms.
However, there are paediatric patients who are severely ill with coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently," Dominik said.
The doctor said there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place in the pediatric infectious disease clinic.
The really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in the ARU.
Children with post-coronary syndromes have been on the ward continuously throughout the year according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects adolescents as well as several-month-old babies, in addition to adults.
Hospitals are also seeing children in a severe condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, we have children of several months and adolescent age lying in our hospital," the chief minister said.
However, he is happy that the Children's Hospital of the Brno University Hospital has not yet recorded any child deaths due to coronavirus.
According to available data, as of 6 December, there have been six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 years in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus ward - the cooperation of a psychologist is an integral part.
He also points out that, as in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-coronary syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is recommended even in children," the doctor added.
New Tube architect to oversee D line, brings experience from London Underground
Prague's transport company has selected an architect to oversee the design of the metropolitan metro. Anna Švarc will become the architect from October and her primary task will be the appearance of the new D line, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro should not only be seen as a transport structure, but also as an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who has been involved in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other candidates took part in the tender. "The tender included a cover letter and CV. Apparently, my previous experience in London, where I worked in a team of three people to create a kind of aesthetic manual for the underground there, was decisive," says the new metro architect. Her experience at the Institute of Planning and Development of the capital city could have also been a decisive factor. Prague.
She sees the metro not only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved. However, I will only know how it will actually work in the coming weeks, when the transport company will fill me in on its ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather a series of recommendations, the main aim of which is to maintain the context of all the stations in case they are renovated," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve the public space in the Prague metro is questionable. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is the ideal or whether a personality can cover it, I really don't know yet," concludes Švarc.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
You can see them on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the game preserve).
You can't ski/bike in the woods outside of marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course it's not policed that much outside of national parks).

China is building the impression of a contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jiroush: China is building the impression of a contained contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing deflected criticism for failing to contain a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are vying for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are helping fight the coronavirus in many places, including in hardest-hit Italy.
What is the perception of Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, while Reuters, citing the police commissioner, said there were over three hundred children aged five and up. Some were chained together, while others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out following a tip-off. He described the school as a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was razor wire over the walls. He said it was a case of slavery.
Several people were arrested in the raid, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo, who was a teacher there.
The children told police they were taken to the school by their parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who are from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by their parents from the northern Nigerian states," spokesman Sabo said on the identity of the victims. The Nigerian states in the north are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school masqueraded as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freedmen were taken to a stadium where they are being given aid and food. Some have already been reunited with relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided free of charge by banks. However, the offer should be considered as some additional services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation for banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic maintenance is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the fact that the waived fees will one day come back to them. With the small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts can. A child gets his or her own payment card, can enter payments, track account movements, and somewhere has his or her own electronic banking. Banks may set up the account, but it's up to parents to teach their children how to use them and also monitor their payments.
"In a relatively flexible way, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services and so on. But above all, they can keep track of what's happening on the account, either by peeking online or through SMS information. Beware, these may no longer be free," Kuncová adds: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their child's abilities and capabilities."
Jaromir Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him peace of mind
Host and businessman Jaromír Soukup (50) does not shy away from any question. In his show "Call and Write to the Boss" he publicly comments on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he glosses over in a sparkling and witty manner. Although he wasn't laughing this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news of Karel Gott's very serious illness. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel has fallen ill and he said it fairly, without the tabloid journalists poking around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I wish him a successful treatment and, above all, peace! Peace, which he needs now," said the owner of Barrandov television.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself decides to give to the media. I don't even like the various statements about what his old friends and various celebrities think about his health. And I can say for our media that we will only cover his illness and his person if he expresses interest in it. I think other media should consider a similar approach."
The couple wrapped the bitch in tape and drowned her in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in a village around Valašské Klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog, aged one to two years, which she wanted to take care of. However, her partner, who was ten years older, did not like the fact that it was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated its vocal expression. He placed the dog in a jute bag, which he tied up. Then they drove the animal together to the river, where they dumped it in the bag. At the moment the dog was thrown into the water, it was clearly alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, children playing by the river found the jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. They called out to a woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency line 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the town's residents, the police have identified the likely perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," the police spokeswoman added.
An expert opinion from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in an unequivocally agonizing manner as a result of suffocation, with the animal suffering for several minutes before dying.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at any cost in this despicable way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín charged the pair with the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. If convicted, the two accused could spend up to three years behind bars," Kozumplíková said.
Two people did not survive the crash
The plane was carrying two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane was requesting permission to land at the Chaloupky airport near Klatovy at 8:30 p.m.," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. That was also the last entry, at that time it was supposed to be near Vojovice near Žinkov, according to GPS coordinates.
It never made it to the Klatovy airport. The search for the lost aircraft, which sent out a distress signal, began immediately. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter got involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. But the search did not have a happy ending.
A helicopter crew spotted the wreckage in the woods near Petrovice near Měčín, about six kilometres from where the plane was last seen, just before 9am. "We found the plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches, with pieces also falling to the ground nearby. "The cause of the accident will be investigated in cooperation with expert experts and the Institute for the Expert Investigation of the Causes of Aircraft Accidents," Korandová added.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, he defends himself
The traditionally high-profile battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medallist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American leads the world charts with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. But his start at the top of the season has been jeopardised by a case of missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges on a technicality. Coleman did fail three doping tests last year and this year, but not in the space of 12 months. Indeed, his first offence was backdated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to April 1, 2018, the start of the second quarter, but he did not miss the actual test until June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman committed the misconduct of three failed controls in 12 months.
Coleman's defense was that he merely forgot to update the athletes' whereabouts on the app. "I don't do drugs or take anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of the World Championships.
He suffered his only defeat in six 100-miler starts this year right at the start of the season at the Shanghai Diamond League, where he was beaten by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Championships.
Twenty-two-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru is the second fastest on paper with a 9.86, but he has only been successful in American university competitions.
Thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who shone at Stanford in June with a 9.87, will defend his title. But he ran only 10.29 in his last 100 in Zagreb because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
South Africa's Akani Simbine, triple Olympic medallist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favourites. The fastest Jamaican is 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100 will start on Friday with prelims and heats. Semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medals will be awarded at 21:15 CEST.
A friend of a friend meets a friend of a friend and says, hey, you want an elephant?
I got one and it's awesome.
My wife likes it because it cuts the grass, washes the car with its trunk, the kids play with it.
It's just great.
I'll sell you an elephant for 5,000 if you want.
Friend: All right, let's high-five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains: "Dude, what kind of elephant did you sell????
The lawn's trashed, there's giant shit everywhere, the car's trashed, the kids are scared of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says: you talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that...
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring you their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people know she is a foreigner.
There are hundreds of foreign doctors studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. The paediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, has tried to recruit some of them.
Tara Hussein Tayeb had to sleep a lot to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague at around 5 p.m. The Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimaniyah, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a paediatrician in a hospital and treats young patients in private practice in the afternoons. In addition, she teaches at the university.
World events are dominated by the superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, this is working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by mid-century the mood will be different and it will happen.

I thought of that too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm being wordy.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and tangerines" makes it clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that the American complexes are operated only by Americans.
So in other words, I expect it's already included in that broad term and there's no need to specify further for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just being wordy :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical requirement

Britain's Vicki Holland tortures Milly the cosmos monkey
Horrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it down the toilet and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, with no regard for its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a terrified cosman.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon again.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and ordered to pay an estimated £12,000 in court costs.
Small Monkeys team leader who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue."
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
For a long time the monkey refused even to eat.
Even now that she is settled and comfortable with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will always follow her, Sawyer said.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her flat on drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her home, £1,600 worth of cocaine (less than £50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
How do you take away the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, with honourable exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
As long as you get an A on the test and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can identify the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't bat an eyelash and tell you they're completely fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning it for?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't have the need.
And at that point it's pointless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of the reason it's taught is for the many people who will need that thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all that stuff to stand at the machine, I was totally serious... ...because you just don't.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time where not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Our communist past and the incitement against the educated and the elite probably plays a part in this) However, the price of having barbarians standing by our machines is simply high.
If only journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these proportions.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrea's war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to nosy fans' probing questions about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Things have been sizzling between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move out to see her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri reacted angrily to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's now ex-wife's supposed honesty didn't sit well with his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things and we never really talked about it much in the family either.
I certainly don't want to cause any pity.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can't help it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it the most despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information that is probably quite out of context.
I would dearly like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, reads the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he ended up stealing less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
He then thought of nothing better than to climb to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One of the security cameras then shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene, eating a banana in the process.
When the owner of the apartment woke up the next morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
The police subsequently arrested Cao.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and tied in effect to a pandemic alert.
If it's repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections for the four municipal councils.
People voted for new councils on Saturday in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected councils broke up.
A total of 99 candidates ran for a total of 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected councillors is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and especially the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said Eva Krumpová, the deputy chair of the CSO.
She recalled that the covid-19 epidemic made the elections more demanding in terms of equipment and staffing.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections in Komno in the Uherské Hradiště region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of voters giving them their vote.
Jana Křižková, the current mayor of the municipality, who is a member of the Private Party, also won re-election to the council on their behalf.
The Komňans - independent candidates won one seat on the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the Pro Rovná association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the re-run elections in Lužice in Most.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The Municipality for the People candidate came second, with 43.27 per cent of voters giving it their vote, so it will have three representatives on the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves won the elections in Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and they won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened its position compared to the regular elections in 2018, winning one more seat and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
His epilepsy has complicated his love of sport, but thanks to surgery he has new hope
The first time Honzik's parents noticed something was wrong with him was when he was a year and a half old. He would always stare into space for a few minutes, become immobile and not respond to anyone. The paediatrician therefore sent him to the paediatric neurology clinic where, after a series of examinations, the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, but it did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of medications that stopped his seizures altogether. So at the age of five, the doctors took him off the medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents assumed that Honza was healthy and started to encourage him to play more sports. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven he had another seizure and everything started all over again.
The doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, and the seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honza always stopped perceiving during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and replaced downhill skis with cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although the sport gave him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who was always on the lookout to help him in case of an emergency.
When Honz was 15 years old, his parents decided to try a change of doctor and turned to the specialists at the Motol Hospital. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the lesion - the source of his epileptic seizures - from his brain. "I had to undergo 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain, which sensed its activity, then only they could remove the deposit. It was hell for me for several weeks. I had to lie down and hardly move, wires were sticking out of my head, which were connected to the computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the rather large lesion. "The first days after the operation were very mentally difficult, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and hardly spoke. Compared to how lively and communicative he normally is, it was a frightening change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," says the mother, adding: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors it happens. He has been seizure free for 3 months since then."
This school year, Honza will graduate, besides sports he enjoys languages and has started working with the E Society, with whom he travels to schools to give talks about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports slowly. "I'm learning how to do sports properly, how to breathe well so that I don't put my body under sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, he will therefore not yet be actively participating in the traditional EPPI paddling triathlon, which brings together epilepsy patients and healthy athletes and which will take place this weekend on 28 September 2019 at the Veselská sandpit. But hopefully next year it will be.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff people write here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, that's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic standpoint (which, after all, was the goal, to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, I do mind how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, like the 30 years
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have no business together
Download the free Metro 2033 Redux and Everything on PC, you have until Thursday
The link to both games is on the Epic Store here. You can also add games to your library directly through the site, but you'll need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play. You have until October 3.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original 2010 game, adding graphical and gameplay changes from the Last Light sequel.
Based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's book of the same name, the story is set in 2033 in a post-nuclear war Russia. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity has had to take refuge underground, in this case in the vast complexes of the Moscow metro.
"Take the post-apocalyptic world and the oppressive atmosphere of the unknown environment, take away the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action passages and tradas: Metro 2033 is born," we wrote in a contemporary review on Bonusweb.
Everything, on the other hand, is a relaxing game-within-a-game in a procedurally generated world that carries the message of English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. The player can become anything, from animals to trees to a planet.

A French chef is suing Michelin for taking away his star. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after he won it. He plans to sue the publisher of the red guide to receive the exact reasons for the demotion. Veyrat also questions the competence of the Michelin inspectors, who he says mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is due to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. He will be taking the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin to court because he believes the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. In addition, he said, the withdrawal of the star had taken place without any notice. "I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the chefs?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin reportedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef had put cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspectors did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I've been lovingly working with Savoyard ingredients since the beginning," Veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are frauds who are just stirring up controversy for commercial reasons." An outraged Veyrat does not understand "how they could dare to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé". "They insulted our region, my staff were mad about it. We have eggs from our own chickens, milk from our own cows, gardeners pick fresh herbs every morning," he fumed.
The distinctive chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners and is calling for his restaurant to be removed from the red guide. But the publisher refuses. "As long as the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful charge yet and his lawyer has yet to help him formulate one. "We regret Mr Veyrat's rude communication with us. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
The man fell upside down from 12 metres.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
A man in Ostrava survived the incredible fall on Sunday night, with the help of rescuers from the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Workers at the regional operations centre received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ambulance crews - medical and paramedic - immediately went to the scene.
On arrival at the scene, the paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of around twelve metres and landed head first on concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should have, and the fire brigade went into action.
By the time the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of death.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further pre-hospital emergency care measures, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma centre for further care, informed the spokesman of the MS Region's Emergency Medical Service, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the front line in the fight against the disease is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Rezac.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever from a mosquito on its territory. It is related to climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit, for example, malaria.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito. DPA news agency reported. So far, all the patients have contracted the virus while travelling or through contact with sick animals. Experts say the groundbreaking case of infection is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a 70-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. He had a severe illness and was treated for brain inflammation at a hospital in Leipzig. He is now well.
The West Nile virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. It has since spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe and, in the 1990s, to the United States. It is carried mainly by birds and also by mosquitoes that become infected with their infected blood.
The legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends his belt
MMA had a great gala night full of interesting results.
For things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peña managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hadn't found an opponent in seven years.
Lightweight Charles Oliveira didn't falter, showed a great choke against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a win, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
It came in the women's bantamweight bout between the renowned Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary "midget", because Nunes had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of the paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peña was not going to be forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with an arm bar herself.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents graced each other with plenty of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena took Nunes to the ground where she began to choke her out.
She had to give up the effort and tap out.
The American gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the lightweight title fight between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
Although Poirier fared better at first, the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, as he tried to hit his opponent with an arm bar.
He was not very successful, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of shots.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost for the first time in two years.
In the next fight, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph by landing a hard right hand on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He then finished him off with a series of accurately aimed punches to record his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to get the better of Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her young daughter, now losing for the first time in seven years.
The hip or the hip?
On the face of it, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it's no problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a fairly large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they take on double endings and in some cases remain in their uncloned form.
For example, the words "svízel" or "hip" are both masculine and feminine, the former inflected according to the pattern "machine", the latter according to the pattern "song".
Another group of nouns have different forms in the first singular case, for example, "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are spelled the same way, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, as are other Czech-Moravian word pairs: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih", etc.
Some of the words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally non-cloned, but gradually they are adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the word 'image', which is both masculine and feminine, or the word 'bufet', which has remained uncloned in the middle gender but has masculine endings like 'hrad'.
Civilization in the borrowed tense
Recently I remembered a beautiful "line" from one of the great stories by Simek and Grossmann, set partly in a cemetery, which goes like this: "I pointed out to her that she was crying all right, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They behave as if humans ruled planet Earth. In reality, we are but a speck on its surface, which it can blow away with its enormous forces like a gust of wind blowing out a candle flame. Probably few of them watch the famous British and American science documentaries about the destructive powers of our blue marble. After all, all it would take is for one of the larger active volcanoes to get a good "fart" and our advanced civilization would go down in flames.
And that this is highly likely to happen in the near future. A number of large volcanoes have, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, become "charged and armed" (Katla in Iceland, for example).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it must happen one day, were to happen as soon as possible. Before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, because any properly angry volcano, together with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more of it into the air than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
It therefore makes no sense to forcibly limit CO2 production. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that, with a significantly higher proportion of CO2 in the air, plants produce more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, any warming is much more favourable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
If we take into account the as yet understudied influence of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we have only one reasonable conclusion: let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot compare in strength at the lowest possible cost.

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped obstructing them.
European politicians are pledging support to Greece, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make the uncertain journey?
And what is the situation on the ground?
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says European ExxonMobil chief
Renewables will not be enough to meet future energy demand in the Czech Republic. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented by other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the US corporation ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says this in an interview with HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, which could store unused energy from days when there is plenty of sun and wind, are still too expensive.
In Prague, Ducom visited ExxonMobil's 1,200-employee hub, which is tasked with supporting the company's business activities and providing logistics and other services needed for the company's operations.
We haven't seen a blue sky in three months and we're suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires, now in their fourth month in Australia, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the people themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic impact, as critics claim?
And what will the country need to prepare for in the future in the face of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney-based journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to lock it away.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I do know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how those people are often treated by their neighborhood or even the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who make false accusations.
It's disgusting and a spit in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China plans celebrations at massacre site
The army rehearsed the parade over recent weekends. Shops in downtown Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to draw their curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square and warplanes circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country was putting its military might on display. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would make other countries uneasy.
She was apparently referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming up. But there may also be concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-installed administrator.
Celebrations are also afoot outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen has already put on a special light show on Thursday night. Sia-men lies across from island Taiwan and is one of China's top ten most innovative cities.
Ahead of the anniversary, the list of banned items is growing. It already includes drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices that use radio waves, the Guardian pointed out. China's popular social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information", it added.
"It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) despite all the predictions," said Maura Cunningham, a historian who studies China. "It's a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, won their battle with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators, both students and workers, in Tiananmen Square with tanks.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly adopted elements of a capitalist economy. Critics say it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
The Czech Republic is awash with half-built houses, families have no money to finish
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a difficult situation.
This is because they do not have the funds to finish their houses under construction and banks are refusing to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction work is also rising.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the houses they have already built.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people are moving into unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year and fifty percent of them have been built.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult in that we have to keep certain things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we are making no profit," said the owner of the construction company, Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to experience financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house to cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň said.
Of the materials, copper and iron have become the most expensive, as well as plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction firms are also struggling with labour shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic and a pandemic is holding back the influx of foreign workers.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We are doing well and we will do even better.
But real visions are missing, says ČRO commentator - mujRozhlas
Apart from the traditional celebrations, the entry into the New Year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What did we learn?
The Ministry plans to introduce a flat-rate meal allowance from 2021.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which employees would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, i.e. about one million people who do not receive meal vouchers yet, will be eligible for food support.
However, according to David Rýc, chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, many small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or by making agreements with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, it will not be used to pay health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also remain.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to reimburse a maximum of 55 percent of the cost of a meal voucher. The remainder is paid by the employee, and in some cases the employer, but without the tax credit. The most favourable value of the meal voucher for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
As in, I find the thesis great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write the written part.
The internship is totally fine here, unless you are a total macaque and have something left in your head, the committee won't choke you on theory unnecessarily.
For example, I studied for a week for the state exam and when I was stumped, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I got right away and I got it right.
Otherwise, about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do their term project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the course that incorporates the knowledge gained in the project, not just a defense.
Auto tune brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the headline of a lengthy text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative afterword then goes on to say that for decades the medical community has ignored the facts about obesity and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war on overweight people that has not only tainted public opinion but also ruined many lives. But now it is time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states right at the outset is that there is often a very long and tedious road from knowing and understanding the facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, where some captains as early as the seventeenth century gave lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that they would prevent disease. However, the British navy abandoned this practice because of fears about increased costs. The clear effect of fruit in preventing and treating disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the navy to take note. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the automobile, but only became compulsory in the 1960s, just as the first confirmed asbestos-related death dates from 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - no matter how significant - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society in which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obese. More Americans are now living with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Yet obesity is seen as a uniquely personal failing of the individual, which is said to burden the health care system and reduce GDP. The fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on diets subsequently gain more weight than they lose.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic here, with faculties teaching future doctors, for example, devoting only 19 hours of their entire studies to nutrition. Which at a time when 60 process calories that Americans take in come from ultra-processed food - that is, overly processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is again illustrated by reports from doctors' offices, where overweight people typically experience shorter appointments, are treated with less empathy by doctors, and are considered more problematic patients.
But obesity is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, Since 1980, obesity rates have doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has been able to reduce or stop the increase. Absolutely none.
All ok but don't flood the emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they have to play along, otherwise something might happen to them.
But you might as well put a statue of Putin next to a statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it so that he's grabbing Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite Insta throwing sticks at artists.
Once you don't put up stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Plus they keep changing what feature is more important, whether to like, comment or save.
It's pissing me off terribly lately, so I may have to downgrade to tiktoku, where a lot of artists in my industry have success and barely give a shit.
Eventually I might even be happy if something more user-friendly came along that didn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Donbass Workers' Party
Union - yes, break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Belovezhskaya Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open acquiescence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With a stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with a population of almost three hundred million.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has shrunk by ten to eleven million.
Even ignoring the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They have deliberately deindustrialised, put the brakes on agriculture, severed from the world's greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first of the socialist camp and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a 'power vacuum'.
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day, mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Accident on the D5: The motorway was closed by a collision of trucks
The incident was reported at around 08:00 on kilometre 22 in the direction of Prague. "The motorway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Cars can go through the petrol station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said this morning. Traffic was able to resume around 2:30 p.m. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least CZK 2 million, and police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian firefighters, said one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was carrying plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were displaced, which firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the vehicles had a damaged fuel tank, which leaked about 200 litres of diesel. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 litres. Staff from the environmental department of the Beroun town hall were called to the accident because of the fuel leak. The removal of the crashed vehicles and the clearance of the motorway was ensured by a private company, which also removed the contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs CZK 189 per kg.
I buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain discounts it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the expiry date - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
The Germans elected Keller to head the football association
As expected, the current head of Bundesliga side Freiburg, Fritz Keller, has become the new president of the German Football Association. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, caterer and hotelier was elected unanimously for a three-year term and had no opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over an affair involving undeclared income. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will again go on trial over possible bribery in the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of his main goals will be to restore confidence in the federation and lead it out of the crisis. "It will not be a one-man show, many people will bear responsibility. The federation is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do it.
Keller left his post in Freiburg after his election as head of the union.
The Děčín zoo is delighted with a small macaque
"Our troop currently has seven members. Its youngest member was born on 17 August, given birth by the female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. For the first few days after giving birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed against her body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. However, at about three weeks of age, she gradually started to put the cub down for a little while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín zoo has successfully raised 12 cubs of this species.
The macaques are so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. Their typical features are their black fur and the chocholka on their head, which gives them their name. Macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they eat both plant and animal food. Their diet is dominated by the fruits of rainforest trees, supplemented by flowers and leaves. They meet their protein requirements by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"Leaving aside the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else is man's fault. Locals hunt macaques as a favourite prey with tasty meat and for their fur. The burning and cutting of the rainforest is also fatal to these animals," the spokesperson added.

Přerov: Driver crashed near Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
A tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia failed to control the steering and drove off the road. The car overturned on its roof and he was wedged underneath. He did not survive his injuries.
"According to the initial information found on the scene, a passenger car travelling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned on its roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Miluše Zajícová, a spokesperson for the Přerov police, told news server novinky.cz.
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take things like this to help the temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I suspected it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like, it was good stuff, full of completely unnecessary lectures about how I should wash and not be a pussy.
It's a shame about the paper, they wouldn't have to cut down the forests for this.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail gets you to comply because you like the person without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or when I tried to leave her apartment early, she'd break down in tears and beg me on her knees not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she went nuts.
Then I ended the relationship, telling her I was breaking up and insisting that we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and keep her from having another fit.
A man like that sucks the feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better to keep your distance
when insurance companies are rampantly ripping off people who wouldn't even know about this horrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we accomplish is complications for companies, carriers and others because of their employees getting five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the west, they've stopped the shenanigans and recognised that there is no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he has to steal some more and fuel his ego by inventing faggotry.
I see we're getting the good old scumbag back again.
After a few years of decline and suppression of this crooked business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight again.
I was one of the recruiters, I gave it a try (I was 20 years old, freshman in college), the initial promises of product and sales skills training quickly morphed into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering as I wanted to help people, however the training was more on how to scare and talk people down.
When the first money came in, you quickly realised that if you wanted to make money, you had to pitch a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made you feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump on every tip and to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone together.
There are people in this business who are successful and even helpful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. Media speculated during the week that the army planned the last farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence as bombastic as soldiers can, despite the wishes of the family. There were also discrepancies over the date of the funeral. Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the Friday date of the funeral has been agreed from the beginning, nobody has changed it. The same applies to the military honours. We are still discussing the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place on Friday and will not lack all the military honours, including a flyover by fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the final farewell to the popular general. The organizers have decided not to have people who worked with the general in the past attend the funeral ceremony!
This includes, for example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hard-working, intelligent and a "good guy".
In addition, in recent years he regularly met him at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I would personally go to Milan Jakubů's funeral," Šándor told Blesk. But he can't.
"I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates are usurping the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize a funeral in this way," the security expert said. He is also not happy with the alleged consideration of closing the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of the army top brass.
"The leadership of the army is not classified and neither are the leaders of military intelligence, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, for example, we see them there. If the media information is true and the family has indeed been overlooked by the military, it is of course a family matter. I personally would never allow the army to overrule the family and its wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer was about to enter the opposite direction in a curve, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to avoid the collision. His wife (47) sustained serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit in the accident on Thursday.
No Czechs or children allowed. The CTIA has uncovered discrimination in restaurants
These included misinformation about prices and failure to comply with the principles of fairness in sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refused to let smaller children into the establishment. According to the CTIA, its website states that the establishment is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically by a consumer whether it was possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four at that restaurant, an employee of the restaurant replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under eight," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague establishment refused to allow Czech speakers to sit at the table, while allowing English speakers to do so. "The Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit down at the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," a spokesman for the CTIA described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As the cases have not yet been definitively closed, the spokesman could not provide further information on the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination was found only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination mentioned above, it found other irregularities in 64 cases. Most of these were failures to comply with the principles of fairness in sales and to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the Inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. Fines of CZK 60,000 have already become final in these cases.
I haven't seen much of this in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, the managers mind their own business and don't stick their noses in our business.
So regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form it's done here it's quite good (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll see what worked and what didn't) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you by some numbers, etc.
Company events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you get the feeling that we are a kind of almost-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us too much as long as there are results.

Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police have been searching unsuccessfully for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, 12 December, Jakub Kulhánek, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the resignation, announced on social media that the woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon the British police confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
In respect of the family, we will not give any more information on the case.
Our condolences, Kulhánek tweeted.
The young woman was last seen on 28 November on a bus on her way home from work, before she was due to withdraw money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
London police subsequently launched a manhunt for her, with Interpol listing her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police had already arrested a man in this connection a few days earlier.
However, it did not disclose what role he was supposed to have played in the case and what it suspects him of.

Four municipalities gifted themselves new councils towards the end of the year
On Saturday, 11 December, the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region elected new councils.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils broke up.
99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats in the new elections.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won seats.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men ran for 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of Saturday's election results symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeat elections to the municipal councils and, above all, the much-watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last polling station was processed at 03:49 on Sunday 12 December.
On Monday, the results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
May the fans be positive, Hasek wishes. Sparta will play in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. We'll do our best to get through the match, both in terms of play and results," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for the club's television.
In the week he decided the cup match in Jihlava (2:1) with a goal. Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a must for them. They are relieved, but they continue to struggle.
Even though the season is slowly moving into the second period, Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it is still Sparta that has very good players. It's going to be a difficult match," warns Roman Procházka of Plzeň.
The last time the Spartans came to Štruncové sady, in mid-May, it was a clear-cut affair in the extra time. The visitors left after a soulless performance with a 0:4 drubbing, the biggest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the game, Sparta are now nine points behind after ten games of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for us, nor for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different than it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would be happy if they would continue to support us, stay positive and get behind us."
Sparta doesn't know if it will be able to use Tetteh in Plzen, who received a two-game suspension for the sending off but appealed on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the squad who remembers Sparta's last win in Plzeň in 2011, remain on the injured list.
The home side, who have won their last five games including Wednesday's cup game in Hlucin, should only be missing midfielder Cermak. And defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan alumnus, should lead them into the match as captain.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and Saturday in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, open both days from 10am to 6pm.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archive looks at the written heritage from the reign of Václav IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, said Jan Vojtíšek, the author of the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopaedia of agriculture, or to a breviary, i.e. the prayer book of one of the Benedictine nuns of the St George's Monastery at Prague Castle, dating from the early 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why people should see the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts the semi-detached figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslaus IV, also contributed to the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see John Wycliffe's Latin collection of treatises from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the library of Wenceslaus IV has survived on Czech territory. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king longed to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. The library, however, disappeared soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed during the Hussite conquest of the castle. A few codices were saved, however. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a condition that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public, so to speak, live and not only in the form of the digital library Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, a free exhibition entitled What Lies Beneath the Floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be open in Klementinum.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease here at the very beginning, but it went off without a hitch.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of much of the population at all levels of the population is something I still have a problem with.
I'm most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He'd be stripped of the presidency and eligibility to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are very slim as others here mention.
Plus, I'm not sure if the mapping of the dossier could even be considered treason.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who go without sex for a year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who are sex-abstainers rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women aged between 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of media, social networking sites and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, may also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged between 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common among people in marriages, with only 5% saying they had gone without sex in the past year in 2021.
For single people, the figure was 29%. Stone added that married people under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religiosity also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although married people are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided in their opinion of premarital sex, with about 30% considering it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting the trend," Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the prevalence of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend caught on especially during the lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they are good with money. The survey did not confirm this
"So it turns out that young Czechs have a little more confidence in their knowledge of finance than is the reality. A significantly higher proportion of wrong answers were given by women and respondents without a high school diploma," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university graduates are more likely to trust their knowledge about financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the workings of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), through self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in third place from lessons at school (21 percent).
It is mainly women who consult their parents about financial matters, while men are more likely to look for information on the internet. Getting information about finances from parents is prevalent among young people of all ages, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Brochures from financial institutions, professional magazines and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of children being brought up by their parents, who are the authority in all major areas of life, becomes apparent. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents, who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring, is crucial," Palendalova said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 per cent of young people.
Young people are unanimous on the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather than save and own a home.
The strategy of saving and investing in fixed assets is shared by 94 per cent of respondents. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The survey strategy is then 100 per cent held by married people with two or more children and public sector employees. On the other hand, people living alone and with an income above CZK 30,000 per month are more likely to want to enjoy themselves.
The whole issue of mandating vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a section of the population to engage in behaviour that they do not want but which could save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question, and one on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be to blame for the death of an eighty year old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, heard some misinformation, and as a result didn't get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a die-hard opponent of vaccination, who is here shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
The Brno Grand Prix? Tickets are about to get more expensive
The most expensive item before the Grand Prix every year is the entry fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno for the Grand Prix spend money on accommodation, food and entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with the event, including the entry fee," said Petr Pelc, an economist.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have that many world-class tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Turin airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
The Grand Prix in Brno
- Cost over the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five editions: 682 million crowns
- problem: lack of money for the organisation, increasing registration fee for the Dorna promotion company
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the next five years
According to Filip Hrůza, director of the Institute of Public Administration, the organisers must now evaluate whether the race is profitable for Brno. "The Grand Prix siphons money from public budgets for other matters. To some extent, however, this is a political question, not an economic one," he said.
In the future, the costs of the motoring event could be even higher. The option of almost doubling the registration fee is in play.
"The situation is not closed, we have to try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is prepared to contribute to the organisation of the race. If the worst scenarios come true, I am afraid it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising because of the difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," Vaňková explained.
The organisers can also raise more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the re-pricing of tickets to that," said Brno's opposition ANO deputy and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
I still see myself as a kid who is still just getting his bearings, says Jan Cina
"It was a great school for all those who worked on it. I fell in love with Afro dancing there. The way I have something Romani in me from my dad, I was completely enchanted by it," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the First Step series of his role as a cameraman in the new film National Class. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have tempted him a lot. "It was a tough job, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I used to drive as a non-driver. A lot of filming also took place in the South Town in Prague," he said about the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for a Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it a career highlight. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a kid who's still just figuring things out. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he hadn't even thought about the thank-you speech in case of a win. "Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, that's what I always imagined speaking to people."
Jan Cina has lived with his colleague Petr Vančura for 13 years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To like each other and to see problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the Czech Lions award ceremony when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn't long before he was on the floor. He managed to make a virtue of it. He had a Vanchur's Stairs workshop where he taught how to fall down stairs safely at VIP events."
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, for its plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - something many countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement, however. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to switch fully to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of its buses or taxis running on electricity.
The official tourism organization says that roughly 95 percent of its energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica ran on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The density of forestation also contributes to reduced emissions. The rainforests with their diverse flora and fauna, which cover more than half of the country, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, as well as around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot considering the country's small size (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or mist forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pristine waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
A snow-free Czech Republic.
How will a mild winter play into the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent memory in the Czech Republic.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather also complicates the preparation of the Jizera 50 cross-country skiing race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it is not about the pan-bikers.
Once in high school, a teacher took us across town to the boathouse so we could ride boats on the river.
On the way there, we walked down this one fairly wide street and who do we see in the middle - a follower of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
Luckily I ran away, but they got into a fight with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are very spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already breaking down, says Orozovic
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in our relations," Morawiecki told a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The chancellor said the crisis, triggered by worrying Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy Group", bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he had informed the Chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially created a migration crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, as night after night we see hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He has discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
Vandal damages cemetery in Dobruska
According to a report received by the police, the vandalism at the dispersal area inside the Dobrush cemetery was supposed to have occurred on Wednesday between 1 pm and 5 pm.
"The material damage was estimated at CZK 60,000. Police officers are asking any witnesses to report their findings in person at the police station or by calling the toll-free number 158," police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná said.
Crimestoppers are investigating the case as damage to foreign property and disorderly conduct, which carries up to a three-year prison sentence.
Drunk Polish nun caused accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene after a while, but another nun was driving the car and tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her licence for failing to yield the right of way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle had been hit by another nun who had asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and immediately revoked her driver's license after finding that she had over two milligrams of alcohol in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
Slovaks succeed, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in its appeal against the closure of a stadium for racism by fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualifying match against Wales without spectators, but instead the federation will now only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during their recent qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting team of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. It closed the stadiums of both associations for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000 and Hungary €67,000.
The Slovaks, on appeal, were only fined 15,000 euros for offensive political chants. The national team's next match in the European Championship qualifier against Wales on 10 October in Trnava will thus be open to fans.
Shops destroyed, fires in the streets, riots accompanied the commemorative parade
Five years ago, 43 students of a college in Ayotzinapa went missing and despite extensive investigations, the case has not been solved. The students were allegedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is unclear exactly what happened afterwards, but investigations suggest that the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial parade was held in the Mexican capital on Thursday as families sought to express their frustration at the continuing failure to find answers and explain their children's disappearance.
But the mostly peaceful march was disrupted by small groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, vandalised monuments, set fires and smashed windows around the city.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything possible to catch them and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people have been arrested as part of the investigation, but not one of them has been convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, with investigators allegedly torturing suspects, APTN added.
Hugo the dog is doing his best.
But Juraj Šajmovič has not protected his film.
Czech family comedy filmmakers have looked to American stories about pet dogs.
But in doing so, they forgot one important thing: the laws of film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitsch film Gump - The Dog Who Taught People How to Live, another film is now competing for the audience's emotions.
Co-writer and director Juraj Šajmovič Jr. is loosely following his previous film, Here I Watch, from 2012.
Hugo the talking dachshund and some familiar characters return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Sumava guesthouse, which is failing and so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie's father and his partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmović (who is also the film's producer) had already struggled with the narrative techniques in their previous dog film, but there at least the children and the dog had fun.
This time, the creative duo have written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, though a scientist, succumbs to the darker delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever the coordinates specify - on the hood of a car or a church steeple (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), Mojmír, a retired colonel, despite his years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the woods, who falls into a coma, whereupon she is taken by her family to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude with a dog.
Nothing against the cleansing healing of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed to convey this message.
A pair of female staff thieves, a dog-walking contest, a Sumava charlatan, cops arriving on a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs the fertilising power of bone meal - which the drunken family at the guesthouse, of course, get drunk on.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and sits, toned and made-up, with a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father's whiskey and flakka as a cured vegetarian, it's impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the filmmakers explain to the viewer that "sometimes that happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a sense of character and punchline, and directorial direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression muddy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parts, they don't have much to play.
The only positive point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a couple of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more folksy vulgar expressions the characters commit.
Nor is years of membership of the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the lady producer - an argument.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and human-dog friendship, there must be a knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much eroticism and minimal sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass muster.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from exactly the kind of morons you are.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here it's obvious you don't understand shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to these kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job for extra income.
Thomas Cook: Czechs were thrown out of a hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees weren't enough.
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency this week. The future of the Czech subsidiary is currently under negotiation, with a decision expected by the end of September.
According to Jan Papež, vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be declared, the company will be sold or the team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, however, cannot be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to the two prematurely terminated tours, the CK is also dealing with cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own pocket, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. The CK has promised to reimburse its clients for the payments, according to Pope, and the company has sufficient security to do so.
Problems in hotels have arisen especially in Mallorca, where the company has asked for help from the Czech consulate. In this context, Pope described to ČTK one of the cases when a hotel there kicked out all the tourists of the office. "The hotelier was unable to determine who belonged to the German and who to the Czech company. Therefore, he kicked everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up nearly 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. The company's net profit, on the other hand, fell by around CZK 7 million to CZK 15.3 million. However, the company was left with an outstanding loss of almost CZK 103 million from previous years. The subsidiary comprises two core divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the Global Travel Lufthansa City Center business.
The Middle East has been plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore more of an exception.
That's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas setting, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
The rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests that are at stake, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water managers warned of drought long ago.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, there may be less rainfall," predicted Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tankers on the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year my orders are up seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," reported tanker driver Imad Suleiman in September.
Clashes have erupted between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely without water.
The region has experienced its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defence minister said that talks in Vienna had produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington that preparations were under way for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who is staying in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a news conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna have made "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing them."

About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wanted from me.
I eventually found out that my suspicions of a pyramid scheme were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I pestered the lady with more doubts and questions for a while and finally said thank you and left.
Call me a punk, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalisation room with a television showing footage of the brutal police crackdown on students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. This is also the subject of a new exhibition at the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basic idea is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said Tomáš Chvátal, the exhibition's curator.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the exception that the first demonstration in Semily was on 22 November, and then more people gradually packed in every day," he said. Among the most active at the beginning were a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the town and its immediate surroundings to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečks, who circulated a petition called "Several Sentences". According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was formed relatively quickly. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Visitors should be drawn into what was happening in the town at the time by some 50 photographs taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, has also survived and will be on loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily archive has also lent a number of preserved banners from that time for the exhibition. "On them were: Let's not get drunk on corn, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some of the changes in the town were very rapid at the time, for example, in December the people voted in an all-Semily vote to make the square Riegrova Square and abolish the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also depicts the events before the November events. "In the first part we present to the memorialists and students what was before, a kind of late normalisation. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then Museum of the Workers' Movement," Chvátal said. One room is meant to evoke a sense of what it might have been like in the living room of an ordinary household back then.
The last part of the exhibition is again dedicated to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who lived through it will remember the posters of With Us to Europe or Václav Klaus still there under the OF banner with the beautiful motto Everyone for his village," the curator added.

Skiers hit the mountains this weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators are not complaining about the lack of customer interest, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people hit the cross-country trails and the slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
Skiers were favoured by the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really worked out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Jested Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the period after contracting covid-19.
René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told ČTK.
"We have only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rental and sales shops are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokisova from Skiopava in Opava.
She expects more traffic during ski courses.
David Šinták, the managing director of Snowbear in Hradec Kralove, also feels that there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as there used to be because of the covid.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost out of rentals.
Compared to before the pandemic, we're at about 50 percent, Shintak told the Czech News Agency.
He said people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learnt to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental shop in the Novako complex in Bozi Dar is seeing a high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested in renting skis now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the resort.
She said there is also interest in the ski school, which is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to experience a quality life here as they do abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of a company really doesn't just go abroad.
But I agree with the rest.
If these people do not have a good life in the Czech Republic, and if these people do not have a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started because one fine day Orban won, ruled for a year and suddenly the annual emigration went up by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the elections in general.
If life is going to be bad here, some traditional V4k lunatic might as well win.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on a plane will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury or is it make-up for the sake of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor, from the Lambeth police department where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech left work at around 7:45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by a co-worker on December 3.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the message continued.
MP Harriet Harman, who raised Srncova's case during a press conference on Saturday, is also urging the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man in connection with the case and he remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, police have not provided any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of doing.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. approx 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
These are not "huge numbers" but ca 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you conclude that Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison to the situation in 38 is off on so many points I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the first Punic war and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it wasn't going to abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, they will affect mainly suburban connections
Passengers on Prague's integrated transport (PID) will have to face several changes from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their routes, and others have disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly joining the integrated system.
In the capital, fast trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station from Sunday.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains will start running on the route from Beroun to Český Brod through the Prague Central Station.
The R17 fast train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station.
The PID will be newly extended to other areas.
Among others, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague's Zličín and will go as far as Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection Prague - Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when the new express line 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the metro station Střížkov, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 runs via Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimon and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation on ten local lines in Central Bohemia has been cancelled or restricted, among others to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmital pod Třemšínem.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers at other locations as well.
Buses are replacing some cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague is being extended, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.

Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option for food is to go next door to Billy's or a little further down the road to Lidl.
Since I don't get any exercise after work I don't have the energy to exercise so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most pizza buns and for snack yoghurt and apple.
Question: what healthy, uncooked food would you recommend I buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a metre of snow like you do, unfortunately that's the way it is.
And it's not the trees you necessarily need to see.
Only the tip of the tree may be hiding under the snow.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from the slopes, but it's one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedved's relationship.
The famous footballer even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss the fact that Dara has caught a bear, sorry, Nedved," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She says he hit on her, not the other way around.
For three days they have been the centre of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it's jumping out of the can, or us, whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
It's as if some of you want an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough for each other, or if you insisted that everyone should know the list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and errors.
That's what you want, Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedved is a long-time vice president of Juventus Football Club.
They only came out now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana had been separated for three years, but had only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are only human too, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband too, and just as he stands by me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Pumpkin World opening delayed by ripening pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlickobrod Region) - The farm in Nová Ves u Leštiny in the Havlickobrod Region opened the Pumpkin World today for more than a month. The decorations made of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year because the pumpkins in the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipek family's fields took longer to ripen. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has been against them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some varieties did not come out. "We have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some of the gourmet varieties have failed," Pipková said. Still, there are several varieties to choose from at the farm, from the aforementioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and carving decorations to hokkaido cooking pumpkins or elongated "spaghetti" pumpkins to decorative gourds of various colours and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers hand hoe the plants and harvest their fruit, cutting the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. The Pipkas have been opening the Pumpkin World regularly since 2010, and past editions have attracted thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by straw attractions or log mazes. Visitors can also see the animals raised on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where the growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors tell them about other ways to adapt pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired too," Pipkova said. She noted that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like cucumbers.

Hi, the other commenters have probably already said all the essentials, just confirming that dorms are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends within the first semester or two and then found sublets together, which I find to be the best option because you know who you'll be living with.
Apartments aren't usually advertised very far in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it definitely doesn't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc. are pretty bad addresses), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-oriented, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it's close to most of the faculties of the BUT (I don't know where exactly you're getting in).
So I've never looked for a rent, but I'm a native Brnoer, so I can possibly advise you about Brno as such, if you're still missing some information :)
But that's an example of completely "normal" thinking to me.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it's actually perfectly fine that the state doesn't fund some schools enough.
Either let them teach what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket, or let them go by the state and the state will pay for it.
We can't let a private actor take over a piece of the education system just because he throws in a few crowns on top of the full state contribution and thanks to that he can teach whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier made such a statement about a petition drive to boycott the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against a statue standing in the town square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, five hundred Czech clients affected
Neckermann is cancelling flights in connection with the insolvency of British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r.o., operating under the business name Neckermann Travel Agency, has not filed for insolvency," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, Neckermann CK is forced to continue to cancel scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellations will affect around 500 clients. The 800 Neckermann clients who are currently abroad, he said, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flights is assured".
The travel agency admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary for clients to contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann immediately," Šrámek added.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency entered into a deal under which creditors were to inject £900m into the firm.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism, which was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as 20 September, it was reported that the creditors had demanded that the travel agency obtain a reserve of £200 million or the deal would fall through. By then, on Monday, the company had already announced that it had gone bust.
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've experienced when cataloguing/digitising that they (even long-time professionals) either throw it away by eye somehow, or write something along the lines of xxx *** or ... (depending on convention) and put in a note that it's illegible.
Truth is, in this case it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it entirely.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you could look in some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character to match what's physically on the coin.
P.S. Isn't that more of an Odryan empire (kingdom) than an Odryan one?
PSS: someone already broke it down for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse embarrassment than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because nobody understood a text is laughable.
All the important documents that are approved are examined word for word; some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in the various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relations.
Plus, it's quite interesting about the English language, after the UK left the EU.
Trump is considering cancelling the registration of Chinese stocks in the US
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking the permission of Chinese companies to trade on the US stock markets. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the affected companies on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, taking the entire market down with them.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. It confirmed a Bloomberg report that had sent shockwaves through financial markets shortly before. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
Shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges in the US, according to government data from February. They also include at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that the exact mechanism to withdraw Chinese companies' shares from the US exchanges has not yet been worked out. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries is having a negative impact on the world economy and has raised fears of a global economic recession. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC television, trade talks between the US and China are expected to resume on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not threatened, Kremlik reports. But a change of operator is at stake
The Transport Ministry on Friday started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a back-up plan that the state would use in case the current toll contract is finally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing another interim solution if the tender cannot be completed on time. Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (ANO) said this on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The ministry will file an appeal against the decision.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services for the operation of the new toll system, which is currently being completed by the consortium of CzechToll and SkyToll," the minister said.
The state would thus be looking for the operator of the toll system currently under preparation, which will be launched in December this year. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case in the last tender, nor would it involve the use of the old system currently operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlik, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on my experience with the toll tender process so far, I am deeply convinced that the Office is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period set by the Office," he said.
The ministry will therefore prepare a temporary solution in addition to a new tender procedure, which would solve the collection of tolls for an interim period until the state finds a full-fledged solution.
Thus, the state will probably not yet use the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian firm offered to operate the current system for the state in case the toll contract is cancelled.
At the same time, Kremlik reiterated his belief that a back-up plan would not be needed. The ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
On Thursday, the Office issued a decision banning the implementation of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until a year after the authority's decision becomes final. It is not final and can be appealed to the president of the office. The ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which is expected to be launched in December.
Last year, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won the tender for the new toll system and its operator. It won the toll tender with a bid of CZK 10.75 billion for a ten-year operation. The current operator, Kapsch, protested against the tender process and the validity of the toll contract, as it failed in the tender with a bid of over CZK 13 billion.
"A frightening result of the study." Islam does not belong in the West, overwhelming majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were surveyed, and the poll shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of those polled are in favor of greater monitoring of Islamic centers.
A majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices and say the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like strangers in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could lead over time to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. The religious freedoms granted to Muslims are in danger of being curtailed."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that the conflict in Austria is not between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarisation, the sociologist says.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university education and seniors over 75. On the other hand, Green Party voters, people under 30 and university graduates are the most supportive.
The Austrian Ministry of the Interior estimates that there are around 700 000 Muslims in Austria, which has a population of around 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country and Islam has been officially recognised as a religion since 1912.
I don't understand the hate on Ceylon.
This is my third year working there and I'm totally fine.
Many times I drive from work I 10 pm and never any problem.
Only someone who has hardly set foot there in his life can say it's a ghetto.
Yeah, probably most of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the centre, I'd go for it.
Plenty of apartments there are newly renovated or newly built now.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová is like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
Most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath on Sunday, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patras' words that he often visits her.
He visits, but he does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda stayed alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annika, Felix and the two grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER!
But we were still talking, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I'm buying presents all the time, and I'll definitely buy something for Dada and Lucie, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
"A parody of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish jail
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to increased cancer rates among local residents.
The researchers mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometres from Istanbul and is home to a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. People living in the area are much more likely to suffer from cancer than the international average, they said.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, despite international criticism
To Sik, the government appeared to take no action on the matter despite the study's clear conclusions. He therefore wrote several articles about the research for the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for disclosing classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that directly affect public health can be withheld. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of persecuting alarmists through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health issue," said Andrew Gardner of AI's Turkey office.
Environmental and human rights organisations have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
Following the foiled 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a widespread wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including many employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities have also suspended or dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organisations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and can't afford it, so are firefighters, and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is only capable of defending Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for long enough.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the countryside should not just be a food factory, says a journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has become scarce in mountain and foothill areas, and even places where there has been no shortage of water are experiencing lower rainfall.
Climate change is the cause of the drought affecting much of central Europe.
But the way we manage our land is also adding to the impact.
What can we do to prepare for drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
The traveller Sigismund or General Bocek. The Senate gave out commemorative medals
The 67-year-old Bocek, who was a fighter pilot in the British Air Force during World War II, thanked all the recipients for the medals. "The Senate was one of the first to remember and not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award I received today also belongs to my comrades who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we want to or not. It is from these values that our successful present is based," Kubera said.
The awardees were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of the Tomas Bata University in Zlín Petr Saha, geologist, writer, traveller and science populariser Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Association and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The Upper Chamber appreciated his heroism - this January he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. Medals were also awarded to former upper chamber presidents Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch.
Zikmund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a lot of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of broadcasting at Radio Free Europe and now works with public media. Steigerwald has also worked as a playwright and screenwriter, while musician Kocáb was head of the parliamentary commission to oversee the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was awarded in advance to astronomer and head emeritus of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs Lubos Perek on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of the year, the same award will be given to Czech-born Madeleine Albright, the first US Secretary of State, and British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she could grab people by the heart. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, a minefield. Images of her wearing a protective suit and face shield became iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe her last in a tragic car crash in Paris.
Now, her younger son Harry has scored as well, as he sets off to the same place as her for the first time in 22 years. He went to a mine clearance site in Dirico, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very thoughtful. He certainly could not help thinking of his beloved mother, whom he had lost when he was only 13 years old.
Harry gave an on-the-spot speech praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where war has taken place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity," he said, also calling for the preservation and conservation of wildlife and local rivers as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He didn't forget to mention it on his official instagram account: 'The Duke is honoured to visit the place and community that were so important to his mother, to learn about their tireless mission and to speak out for all those who (Diana) felt most needed to be heard, even if the issue wasn't exactly a worldwide one,' appeared the Sussex Royal's instagram post.
But royal fans may be disappointed that he didn't take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip to remember Diana. In fact, both have had a separate agenda from Harry since Wednesday, presumably for their protection. After all, taking a small baby into a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to put his beloved family in danger at any cost.

Yeah it's gonna be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I don't know shit about playing hockey, and the tactics (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are a total dud too.
And whether you're hockey team is "bear Russia" or "lame China" losing by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than being tied.
But anyway, listening to Czech commentators nitpicking what referees don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's the way it is with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it's like any other time, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than they've won, I guess it would be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Failure to qualify. Czech athletes have not done well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha started with qualification setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800m heat and neither pole vaulter Romana Maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who was defending her eighth place which surprised her in London last year, qualified.
On Friday, hurdler Vít Müller will take part in the heats and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw 65.46 metres on her third attempt, falling almost six metres short of her best this year, which she would need to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final she needed to clear the 460 cm limit.
Mezuliáníková, who only got to the championships at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF, finished sixth to last in the fourth heat and her time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semi-finals. She was one and a half seconds behind her best this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the turn there, which took quite a toll on me. I thought I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start again, so it was a bit uncomfortable at that point. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was happy to have overtaken at least one rival in the home straight. "She wasn't really doing well, so every opponent I beat was good. But I think it was enough for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. Winnie Nanyondo of Uganda was the fastest half in the heats in 2:00.36.
Missing in Doha is South Africa's Caster Semenya, the best eight miler in recent years, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body but, like some other runners, is refusing treatment mandated by IAAF rules from this year.
In the 100m heats, American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favourite with a time of 9.98, the only one to go under ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at 37 years old is seeking to defend his title, also advanced to the semi-finals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the number two on this year's charts with 9.86, did not start and was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 this season.
The Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form in the qualification of the long jumpers, as he reached 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in a World Championships qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with 865 cm.
The Slovenes beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championships.
Slovenia's volleyball players will play sensationally for the premiere title of European champions. With the support of nearly 12,000 roaring fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning double world champions the Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team looked much more compact than the world champions Poland in the semi-finals. They owned only the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball team overcame themselves in defence and of the players in the red and white jersey, only Cuban-born León actually scored.
However, the home line-up saw both smashers Cebulj and Urnaut in the form of their lives, as well as second all-rounder Stern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini. The Poles paid the price for having won all their previous matches at this Euro with a sovereignty, while the Slovenes gained confidence after tough playoff battles with the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenes lost 1-3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifier in Gdansk this August, but avenged the defeat at home. But now they will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena Stožica. However, after today they are already assured of their second medal in history and can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championship four years ago in Paris.
At the previous European championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech team.
Spare the planet. Scientists' Night starts in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not open to the public at other times," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissection room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the Czech University of Life Sciences and watch the film The Green Desert," Navrátilová adds. Guided tours will also be offered in nine laboratories. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "sparing the planet".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people have died in the Czech Republic, 74 others.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily count since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" major wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK's Health and Safety Executive, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects the number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospital admissions occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour boss Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz by saying that it was conducted "virtually", via computer.
However, it was attended by groups of Downing Street staff gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers threw numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV's commercial television in Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him as Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How fair can it be expected to be?
It will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because the last two elections under Orbán were not either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies in order to profit from this, and does other tricks of a greater or lesser degree.
The latest one so far is that, in practice, everyone can vote where they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition might succeed.
So just to reiterate, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether they would also have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and seats will be won by a united opposition.
This is a great unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they not play even harder in their bid to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the new developments.
It all starts with the language.

I've been beaten up quite a lot, last time I was 14, my mum's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has for a long time but then bangs her extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time I'm very choleric and used to rage terribly as a kid, to the point where I'd lie on the floor in convulsions and be all blue, I was probably taken to the shower twice to calm myself down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence now too, when I was a kid I used to fight quite a bit, now I'll at least punch something to get it out, and when I was younger I'd slap my parents on the arm like that (so I wouldn't get hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it too.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think hitting kids is just plain wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that point when it was no longer "parenting," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, I guess it's impossible not to screw up your kids at least a little bit, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws of this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not worried about loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you having the money to pay the mortgage?

Scientists look for toddlers with a birth defect called ankle valgus in their study
Valgusity (misalignment) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to 10 percent of children. It is standardly treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should speed up treatment considerably.
"We have two prototypes of the shoes, which will be worn by healthy children and children with the diagnosis, to map the effect in both groups. At the same time, participation in the research will have no risks for the children and the measurements will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunova, head of the research from the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website, where a registration form and all information is available.
The researchers are looking for fifty children with the diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The point at which parents should sign their child up is when they take their first independent steps, typically letting go of, for example, furniture that they are holding on to when trying to walk. Taking part in the research involves three measurements over the course of seven months from the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants, it also involves wearing the shoes being tested," Gimun points out.
Kocner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia's trial of journalist Kuciak's killers go?
The main trial in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová has begun in Slovakia.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It has stirred civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How significant a turning point will the trial be for Slovakia?
Sparta is really loaded this year, admits Hradec Kralove back Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. In fact, Hradec Králové defender Richard Nedomlel will play in Friday's match against the club where he recently played. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar position, even though they have never worn the Prague club's jersey.
"Everybody wants to go up against Sparta," says the Hradecky back before the game in the 5th extra league round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which currently stands at three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno and Plzeň, the most appreciated by the fans came on Sunday, Mountfield went to neighbouring Pardubice.
"But we can't look at the games that were. We need to focus on the games that await us now and play as well, if not better," the Hradecky defender warned.
Hradec shouldn't look back at last year's record against Sparta either. They lost three out of four games, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, Sparta's management brought in several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what can we say, this year they are really loaded," admits Nedomlel before the first game of the end of this week.
And the second one? Also a nice one, awaits Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinec.

The press are hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition got orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition from the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and the company bounced back.
On Czech television, people were dying with covid just six months ago.
Lucie Bílá's father wasn't rooting for her at all. You won't believe what she did for a living!
Who doesn't know that national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is originally a seamstress by profession and her own name is Hana Zaňáková, probably doesn't live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively young age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she was a little girl performing in the cultural centre in her native Otvovice, where she still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. That's when the singer in me was born," she admitted to Impulse radio.
Her father, however, was a bit worried about his daughter's future and therefore advised her to follow the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"My dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Get your feet on the ground!' He even talked me into going to the local glass factory. The glassworks is no longer in business, but I kinda am. I'm a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants out of beads, which I then auction off and use the money to buy wheelchairs," she added with a laugh.

Jan Šindelář's comment: Run the railways like a company
Sky's election, while apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad tale of the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year and even after Wednesday night that hasn't changed, as one of the members has resigned. The standstill continues.
The selection process itself was a farce from the start, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in terms of experience, were significantly relaxed. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate had worked in the past were reduced. First the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimps.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he beat out experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest aspect (and the best hope) of the whole process. Today, those involved know that they played only the role of stage sets in a political game.
Perhaps Nebeský will surprise, show great talent and eventually emerge as the best rail boss ever. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political embarrassment. The Czech Railways will not face an easy period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and with a shortage of staff in operations. There is a shortage of drivers, shunters and mechanics. How can they be motivated to continue working and respect the management if the state behaves like an elephant in the china shop in the top management?
The second important group is the creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the top of the railways next spring when the railways defend their rating. What is certain is that the lenders perceive instability. The sad thing is that someone else goes to Moody's every year to defend the rating on behalf of ČD. The agency has not escaped the frequent changes in the management of ČD and the political influence on the company, and has criticised them already this summer.
The ANO movement advocates, among other things, that the state should be run like a company. For a start, it would be enough if one large state-owned company were run like a company and not like a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it were run by the best. They have applied, but the state has snubbed them. It can certainly be argued that the post of head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the antics of the selection process.

Another government ends and the law on municipal involvement in the selection of storage sites is nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste is still not in place.
The government's Legislative Council has suspended consideration of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the municipalities concerned, which are associated in the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments are expecting from the law a significant strengthening of their options in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the repository site is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will proceed at all at a given site.
This can be ensured by obliging the Repository Authority to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposal for a substantive plan almost completely disregards public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set-up of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting and operation.
Under today's legal standards, municipal representatives realistically have few options to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a repository site.
They can only comment or appeal in certain permitting procedures, but the authority or minister whose interests are at stake decides.
Any appeal has no suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-determination of local authorities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly applied in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting repositories, such as Sweden and Finland.
Moreover, the drafting of the law is yet another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and which follows on from the contract with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for this work is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep-Sea Storage said: After the industry ministers, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We offer a helping hand in this regard.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of the lack of municipal rights in such a crucial construction project in a similar way to the municipalities directly affected in the selected locations.
The Platform Against Deep-Sea Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to advocate for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste that is not limited to deep-sea repositories.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible disposal should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was finally scared off by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new figure at the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I used to put everything in my mouth," the actor told AARP in a 2018 interview.
This time, I wanted to take it slow.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that expects a gaming reader, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text, for example, and maybe a college text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more than one kind of boss.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that don't need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even more powerful than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life where there are bosses but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's probably not possible to translate a boss in one word, English and other languages don't solve it (interestingly, only Catalan translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply an important for the story or the game in general, computer-controlled adversary stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or a task.
And where are the spectators? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, for by making the pilgrimage to Doha, athletics has willingly and knowingly forsaken the thrilling atmosphere that prevailed in the sold-out stadium at London 2017 and at last year's European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of Doha's skyscrapers invite to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns are growing about how dignified its backdrop will be.
"Tickets for the finish are sold out on all nights," say organisers.
Only that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colourful tarpaulins, which also display the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics has ventured into territory in Qatar where it has no roots despite the annual Diamond League meeting.
No wonder, then, that only 50,000 tickets were sold in total for the ten days of the championships last week, even though their price started at 60 Qatari rials, or less than 400 crowns.
The organisers have now set themselves the target of filling the uncovered parts of the stands at least half full. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (although the organisers themselves deny it) giving away free tickets to migrant workers and children. Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can comment positively: "This is how we can inspire the next generation."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, and after athletics comes football in 2022. The oil superpower's financial bids will always be lucrative even for wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today's sporting world.
But even if we accept it, and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot help but sigh in a purely sporting way that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been better timed by IAAF leaders - and for a different year. The extremely late date, forced by the climate, upsets the whole scheme of the pre-Olympic season and thus the preparation for the crucial Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes in October.
Hopefully Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations that promise to make the championships ultra-modern and attractive. Isn't it 37 degrees right now? Already the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built right into the blocks, are meant to give even TV viewers a close-up view of what is happening in the athletes' minds in the hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncova since December 3.
The Czech police have also joined the search.
The police have been searching for the 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since 7 December.
The British police are also assisting the British police through Interpol.
The Czech woman Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular about her.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police are cooperating closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
It said she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same colour.
She is believed to be from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in a London hospital.
Her friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The local MP Harriet Harman has joined the search for Petra.
She has been involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face on them.
"We are very worried about her," she told a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is unclear who he is and what he had to do with Petra.
Agent Tesla is terrorising the Czech Republic in the run-up to Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight drop in attack campaigns, attacks picked up significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We saw a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are specifically targeting the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's malicious attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was labeled as Copy of corrected invoice for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird and Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic in late August and early September, and with the holidays and the end of the year approaching, attacker activity is on the rise again.
The Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists intercepted campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October's data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still behind nearly a fifth of all detections.
Attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt also continued to appear.
An attachment in Czech may be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and suppression of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
Today's demos of smart guys who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media is reporting.
From the footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That is to say, a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joined the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population has led them to find common ground.
Anti-vaxxers, anti-Russians and others alone could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the Dead Dog Society are on the rise in popularity, reminding me of the Million Moments for Democracy turned inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be birthed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the money coming in, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-plus-dose vaccine.
It certainly won't be a left or center movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine is almost certainly going to become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we are going to have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad vaccines saved us.
An ingenious action by scientists of which humanity is justly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister who is advocating change
Bulgaria's President Rumen Radev has tasked Kirill Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections, with forming a new government.
He has already succeeded in forming a broad coalition government which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties, which claim to fight graft and abuse of power, failed to reach an agreement, leading to two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago as she drove home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer and the MP representing the part of London where she lived have been calling for information about the children's hospital worker.
"Petra's disappearance is nothing like her behaviour and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video released on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic are also very concerned about her and simply want to know where she is," she continued.
She said the missing Czech left work at around 7:45pm on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by a co-worker on December 3.
According to British media, Srncova worked as a "nurses' assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned for our dear colleague Petra who is missing," the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person for violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court ruled that the paintings of the Mole in the rooms in Šumperk do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a manhole cover had been gaping for a month.
A life was at stake.
The municipality referred complaints to the Regional Directorate of Transport, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole continued to gap.
Eventually, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "address the situation intensively".
Microplastics have reached human intestines, study confirms for the first time
Scientists have confirmed years of suspicions. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philipp Schwabl has published a study that proves for the first time the presence of microplastics in human stool. Although the study is small - with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in the samples of all the people studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six avoided marine fish, and all drank water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the cosmetics industry, or created by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soda; in short, everywhere on the planet. So their entry into the human digestive tract is only officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, lay and scientific knowledge suspects that this is not good. But humanity still doesn't know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. "This is the first study of its kind and it confirms what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will be to at least halt its steep rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years' time humanity will be using a fifth more of them than today. The current rate is a staggering one million bottles bought per minute. Some eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. The waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already taken restrictions and other measures; Kenya, for example, has banned plastic bags under threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small bans (the well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures are nice, but totally inadequate.
