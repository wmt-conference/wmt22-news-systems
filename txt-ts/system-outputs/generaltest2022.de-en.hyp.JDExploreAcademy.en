Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push booster vaccination
Ever new Omicron cases are worrying politics and science in Great Britain.
By New Year's Day, all eligible adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the corona booster vaccinations than previously planned in view of rapidly increasing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why it is urgent to strengthen vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.

I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone deserves to be able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least they could rely on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our guts."
However, this did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was even more disappointing than the bare result was the manner of the performance.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-goal ratio was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in no less than 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife, and did not implement what we had trained for."

While on Patrick's team, even the high achievers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants avoid a total debacle and still came up to eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for squabbling.

Help with first own campaign
Say hello to Boron!
I am currently leading the adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big picture is drawn, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and I'm already tripping over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further plot is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the hero and luring him into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Party size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they do not notice, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow path and flank the wagon, armed with three bows on the left and three on the right, while two stop the wagon with spears.
If there is a battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and are then found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
Of course, the cart is gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you find the deus ex machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to give myself a little breathing space with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 preview on time.
Admittedly, due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in F1, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher were again ignorant of the rules, as neither of them knew that you are allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred at Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, the two only came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on the subject to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
In my opinion, you should simply know such elementary rules when commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guessing what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' contrived commentary style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there is constant silliness, which makes both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the elimination round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV, since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the training sessions than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
Unironically, with the exception of advertising, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Here a treasure chest, shell or similar would have to be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction, ensuring low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet tube or similar by means of a 4/6 mm air hose...and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from flowing backwards once it leaves the basin and passes through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly-crowned astronauts on their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they travelled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honour of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space right away, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometres
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and many other experts consider 100 kilometres above the earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned space trip: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was attended by the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to the climate.

NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage that occurs in poultry farming is exclusively due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers consist of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.

No other vitamin supplement should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.

GDR handmade model of the old E-Lok E 95.03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayman ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts, see photos, good function, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this line.
The required maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1"Co+Co1" locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95.01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Dessau Reichsbahn repair shop, the suitability of all six locomotives for refurbishment was determined.
[4] As the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95.01 to E 95.03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were built first.
It was only when it became clear that the number of E 94s to be refurbished could not be increased further that the E 95s became the focus of the refurbishment.
[4]The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They arrived at the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate rotation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be a problem.
As a result, it often happened that contactors got stuck during gear changes.
Then Beimann, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the contactor during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was frequent and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the split classes, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one at a time, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab, would have posed a problem in train operation.
[5] After the E 95.02 and E 95.03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the last to follow was the E 95.01, which was withdrawn from service on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255,001 was therefore never used.
All the locomotives were dismantled except for E 95.02.
The E 95.02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77.10 as a switch heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The interior of the locomotive was completed in 1986.
The locomotive is cared for as a museum piece in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on restoring the locomotive to working order.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to form the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to carry out optical rework on the locomotive by hand, dusty, with traces of play, cellar smell!!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend had prompted him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I wasn't vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused, because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust."
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.

Fire in transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without power
The lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and, in many cases, probably no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours after a fire caused serious damage to a substation.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The utility thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz installers were initially only able to put some lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30pm.
Since 11.15 p.m., those last affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood help.
"What is important now is that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhoods and inform the local fire stations if help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.

Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We have been in fertility treatment for some time, but now, when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance company, they are suddenly at loggerheads.
In order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and got the approval over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are charged to the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts would be forfeited with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!

"Half a victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelische Pressedienst (epd).
The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher from the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not backing down, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"Apparently, it cannot assert itself when a member state sets its mind on doing its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to information from Poland's border guard, meanwhile, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested in the night of Sunday and brought back to the border.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, who is in power in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response is putting pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.

Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly, except for a few failures.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and this also arrives at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were also similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over power lines with fiber optics?

When it's time to switch current accounts
Anyone who would have thought that there would be a lull in the current accounts would have been mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to use all kinds of tricks to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, has long been considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has just halved the allowance and even quartered the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank group division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight deposits.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers."
Commerzbank had already previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court even got right against this regulation.

Hello lovely girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write about and maybe one or two others feel the same way...
I'm 24, have cPTBS, full-time student and dog mum - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually my child 1 to 1.
My boyfriend (we've been together since we were 6) is ill, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is bandaged due to burns).
On top of that, he has a cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2x a week), which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mum, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we will of course divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is currently well controlled, I am reasonably well treated and I am coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and almost symptom-free.
My university is very demanding right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what happens then is on my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need those mental cues, because otherwise I don't cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm eternally grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't put it into words how grateful I am.
Don't know if I would have survived my cptbs otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought that I would certainly find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!

Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (the real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and an action ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
I think the passage is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If it means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.

With a capacity of 20 litres, it can also swallow larger photographic equipment without any problems, which can be stowed safely using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior, everything else you need in terms of everyday objects remains well organized and can be separated from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photographic equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: the first is the conventional way, via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchoring bars, firmly riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional top-access backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail enormously increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photographic equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you are going to Scotland in the autumn.

Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which, with the balancing of the pane, adapts to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River spotted glowing boulders in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth and fame in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to budget your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This disables one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The tout rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the telltale has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players have to defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Advice and ideas for furthering your career
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I digress here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm currently refereeing as a lateral entrant.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't name anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up in teaching and I was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I've now arrived at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
The times before, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time over the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's the holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my day off was my day off.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures, which also annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and, from the outside, the ref is also doing well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it isn't already.
I wonder if I want to be like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work somewhat boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if, in a year's time, I won't have ended up in the same place as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You realise it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas as to how I can get out of this situation where I'm completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.

Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this ingenious circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual plane until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string tension as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power amplifier that determines the tube character of an amplifier and used this finding to develop the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behaviour, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amplifier.

The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
Of course, what fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with one attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic things.

Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the as yet unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernandez Zapata, told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees, has destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a combined size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
Particularly hard hit was the banana industry, which is immensely important for the island, and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."

Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and children in particular can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling excitement, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the gesture of gift-giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peacemaking "social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas holidays with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were given in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from another life of sin.
This unconventional form of gift-giving gave rise to the popular German custom of filling children's boots with presents.
Protestants objected to this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, only a few are annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the custom of Martin with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in Boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy cuddle over the question of who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost gained some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest an excessive amount of time even for simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start with the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build on it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.

Retailers fear for their Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered are allowed to enter.
Retailers consider this to be unnecessary and complain of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Retail Federation (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth criticised the slump in sales of non-daily consumer goods.
According to a recent survey by the HDE of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off their Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
According to this, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.

The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director.
"2G for shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The wristband regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores that day with the received band.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in the retail trade - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, and revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche."
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made to find solutions for the centers and to get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all stores undisturbed." dpa

The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to brightness adjustment, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working on a film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To carry out the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and that's it.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when it is switched on again - very handy for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality stems from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right one on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply unit.

After the release of our new high-end wide-band B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, an appropriately designed foot is directly included in this construction proposal to raise the loudspeaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably grown-up and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in the treble.
This is generally the case with widebands in order to optimize the excessive frequency clustering.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the treble range can be reduced, creating a warmer sound.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which can be used as a reference, create an enemy dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the enclosures, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate place in order to be able to pass the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer."
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, lid, front and base are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if, for example, you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, it is easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
Subsequently, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the enclosure has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back panel.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening, where it protrudes by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, you lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out there loosely.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions crossover Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive terminal of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
