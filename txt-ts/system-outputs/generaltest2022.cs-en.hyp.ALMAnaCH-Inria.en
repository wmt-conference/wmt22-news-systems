According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbrový million for a title, Tvrdik denied it.
Prague – Crimeans in the current corruption caucus allegedly worked with the accusation of former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr had a promised million crowns for a league title in 2018/19 season from Prague Slavia.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he got to part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the Urshow club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that no corruption negotiations were red.
The server published a transcription of police hearings in which Slavia is mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer in the master club.
The former influential functionary of the Red Whites was, according to the writer, in frequent contact with both Berbre and former sports director Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
The criminals allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbrova promised a financial reward for receiving a title.
2019 won the SK Slavia Prague title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) of the SK Slavia Prague functionalists had a million fees for winning the league, quoted the server from the list.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of Slavia Tvrdik.
There is no longer anything from the list, according to the server, whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He rejected the claim of any corruption.
From 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the attitudes in Czech football and offered an opposite alternative to its development.
We have never initiated illegal negotiations, did not seek to influence arbitrators in contradiction with fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial performance in this context," said Tvrdik for the List of Reports.
In posts, among other things, Nezmar is not choosing to insult some former players of Slavia dark skin, as well as the prayer of his former Tvrdik's chef.
In mid-October, Kauza allegedly influenced the matches through the arbitrators, the police intervention in several locations, including the Prague FACR.
The highest position in the affair is Berbr, which no longerfigures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, as well as former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle worse (the shooter must be made of a pancerated cabin and carry the charges manually without covering).
Cars - Toyoti hi-lux - are new and good
Loaders and various pancer vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat-decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - small and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
A technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Will Smith criticism does not burn
The Distopic Sci-fi viewed by Bliženec (Hemini Man) is proud of an interesting premises - Will Smith is characterized by its younger version in the film, but according to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is a complete top in his field. They kill effectively and without unnecessary questions. On one day, however, he decides to hang his career on the nail. This, of course, does not like his employers who have sent another killer to Henry. The hook is that the killer himself is Henry himself, more precisely his younger column created from DNA. Can one determined person win the fight himself? This time literally.
A certain quality guarantee should be a threefold holder of Oscar Ang Lee. It is his first science fiction, but with dramatic action films he has a rich experience, as he showed, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and dragon or western Riding with a devil. On the scenario, six scriptwriters worked together. The most famous is David Benioff, one of the creators of the successive Throne Games. According to the first announcements, but not all this was enough for a good film.
"Even if Ang Lee is trying to make great things in the technical filmary, the film itself has no character enough to raise it," Fionnuala Hanniganová thinks from the Screen Daily server.
"This unsatisfactory film is min than a summary of all the talents that participated in it, weak scenarios and drawings hold only technological magic of filmmakers," Stephen Dalton summarized his opinion from The Hollywood Reporter.
"The belief is the case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly fatigue or action film," the disappointed reviewer of the Varieti server Peter Deburge does not hide.
"The confused product came up with a bizarre idea," the film summarized in her review by Ella Campová from IndieWire.
"It is difficult to know that one man is a double man of the other when he leaves himself as a man," Nicholas Barber wrote from the The Wrap website.
I have such a story.
I'm gonna beside the city.
From the river climbed nutrition and damaged crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that on the second bank of the river there was a fisherman.
I didn't want to make bordles, so I sat in peace and probably didn't notice the tip.
I hoped that he would leave before something was going out, but of course in a moment the fragment went.
I let her come for 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman sprinkled, had heads on all sides, so I called on him that it was on a frage.
Before I tear out of the possession was a fuch.
I mean, I like a man to be a pigtail.
On the other hand, it is not a war, it would have to be played a lot of accidents to become something, probably you would be seen in the thermal vision that has almost everyone today.
So in a visible place, expensive things to put your feet in the sleeping and you should be cool.

Unusual open and unique picture by Karel Gott in the whole-black documentary film Olga Špatová
This unique film start from Olga Špatová workshop will have a premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In mid-September last year, I was called by Ivanka and Karel Gottov, and they addressed me whether I would make a documentary on his life with Karel for decades again. I did not hesitate to take a minute! Shoot with a person who lasted for more than half a century on the sun of Czech culture thanks to my exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and disproportionate workmanship, was and is a great honour for me. The challenge for me to make a full-time documentary film about Karel Gottov, who brings joy to three generations of listeners, I accepted as a commitment to this legendary singer," describes his feelings director Olga Špatova.
The first shooting day, thanks to the rapid agreement and agreement, took place on 22 October last year, and the last shooting with Karel Gott was shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture the authentic Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who is distributed to his favourites, as painters, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who sends his songs joy to several generations not only with us, but also in Europe, and actually around the world. A man who has written into the heart and soul of his listeners by simply being.
The film should not be an exhibit of the undisputed fame of Karel Gott and his successes. "Therefore, it is not possible to compare my previous film Phenomen Gott with this present. Everyone is different. At least by shooting them in another life stage of Karel Gott, this will be very manifested in his personal, to intimate confessions, which he provided to us and which all claimed us in what legends we have the opportunity to work and spend time, which is indeed indescribable," adds Olga Špatova.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans with us and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at the cottage in the Czech Switzerland, at all where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life, so the film will be completely authentic and unique thanks to the sincere opening of Karel Gott.
"Olga has a great gift to shoot with his narrow team so that we often took a spontaneous atmosphere and naturally entered it into our privacy, thanks to which I told about the topics of relatively confidential. With my husband, cameraman Jan Malir, so actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to show the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life jubilee. But because I lived with my family a beautiful summer, I wanted to shoot as long as possible. Well, and because I was everywhere in 2019, my wish was to be put into cinema in the spring of next year. This documentary film is thankful to my favourites and to all who supported and accompanied me with my profession
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (probably I am not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which were made by the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory military.
We do not even have large warehouses of techniques that could be captured, we do not actually have modern technique or for existing professionals, in addition, modern technique is still more complex, so the ability of the founders will quickly lose in time.
To do this, modern conventional conflicts, where someone can deploy, will take place very quickly, will not be the time to exercise someone again.
Finally, founding/territorial defence is of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead the mass heril and it is also expressed the need to regret the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will only be conducted in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the heroes will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
XXX Lutz can buy a Kika competitor, allowed the office, but has a hook
"The Competition Protection Office authorized, under the conditions of fulfilling the structural obligations laid down in favour of maintaining an effective competition, the association of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other hand," said UOGS spokesperson Martin Švanda.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores. If Kika chain was absorbed, it would take too much part in the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, part of the purchased company must be sold.
XLCEE-Holding buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transactions must be allowed by antimonopoly authorities. Purchase of 22 foreign Kika branches from Signa Holding announced XXX Lutz in May. The sign took over Kiku last year at a symbolic price.
The Chain Kika entered the Czech market in 2005 and is a double after the Swedish company IKEA. Before taking over it by the Austrian company Signa, belonged to the South African company Steingoff International Holdings since 2013, she faced problems when she revealed irregularities in her accounting. Kika has nine sales in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to companies IKEA, Sconto, Jisk, and Asko-Nabitek and Kika belongs to the largest furniture dealers on the domestic market. The same owner has Möbelix brand. After taking over foreign branches Kiki, XXX Lutz will operate more than 300 business houses in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover of EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
We certainly have no reproduction, but we don't have to terror
Some words have disadvantaged connotations, even though they only communicate the state of things. They belong to the word uniforms. The child grows without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know this, uniformly," says without anything to be added. Interestingly, this feature is that the "uniform" bears a long time ago, even from the time the expressions as a demographic crisis have not been widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that to ensure simple reproduction of the inhabitants there is a need for a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. It is also widely known that in Europe today no state is reaching this value. The most close to France or Sweden, but the simple rate of reproduction of the inhabitants of the European state are not guaranteed. (In the framework of the West, only Israel is excluded from the total fertility of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation as done for alarmism. Therefore, it is not a wonder when the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Malachov: "The only one is almost as many as two children's families," said in an interview for the LN. However, she forgotten the devil of the hidden in detail.
Yes, it is good when it is noticed that instead of rich or ideological. It is necessary as in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets a sticker of fashion (in the style of "so it was also supported by Hitler"). It is good when it is reminded that many couples are just planning directly. It is good, if political will to remove the obstacles that lead to the decisions there (the weak expansion of work from home derogates women from other pregnancies). But despite all this, we will notice one thing.
If Minister Malačová says that "the only one is almost so much" is in that demagogia. This sentence was instead of twenty years ago. Recall that the fertility in the Czech Republic last provided a simple reproduction in 1980 ("Children of Husaka"). Then she fell to the threatening 1.14 in 2000. But since then, almost fifty percent has risen, on the present 1.70 children per woman, which is European superdiameter. This is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is instead. Only with this alarmism can remove a little.
Berlin reacts to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. 6000 apartments from private company
Berlin buys from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for €920 million (CZK 23.8 billion) of 6,000 former social apartments sold to the city 15 years ago. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher for Levice (Die Linke), it is the biggest such purchase in the history of the capital of Germany. The opposition criticizes the step.
"The intention is to maintain stable rents in Berlin and give tenants certainty," said in the statement of Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD). "We will continue the construction of new apartments and legally treat the frozen rents," added. General company Hewobah has thousands of apartments located in the districts of Spandau and Reynickendorf in western part of the city this December.
According to the analyst of Efferies Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensive. Bloomberg Rothäusler said that according to his estimates, the residential unit had paid about ten percent over their accounting values.
According to the German opposition party of the liberal (FDP), the Berlin authorities contribute to speculation with real estate on Friday. The FDP stated this on twitter. The "money-shaped" step marked the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
In the field of July, Hewobah gained back 670 apartments in Berlin, Karl-Marx-Allee, reminded Der Spiegel on his website. The prize was not published by the representative. The dispute about the apartments on the former exhibition class from time to time NDR accompanied protests and fulfilled the leading pages of the German press. He became a symbol of the tenant situation in large German cities, wrote a letter.
In recent years, the German metropolis was renowned for low cost of living and low rents, but it has received attractive rental prices, according to the AFP agency over the past ten years, doubled and some inhabitants are so difficult to find available housing.
mainly, we do not have individual skills.
This is not even the worst.
The worst is that the half of them plays like if they had it.
This will then happen to a situation that you look like a fraer who didn't crash the empty gate back 2 minutes, go into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and say "tvl and what are you probably thinking to happen now?".
Well, of course, will elect him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this ability to "behave a defender" is so terrible that I am surprised sincerely when I see that our attacker could play one opponent.
Wife exchange: Ondru's parents are cool tyral! He ended in the institute
It was about nerves. The problem son Ondřej (9) was allegedly hardly punished by his father every minute. "Arrived from school and angry with a snack. Lukaš looked at me and said that the punishment would be punished," said Lucia in Exchange. Dad Lukaš forced the little Ondrej to punish a few hours in the corner! In addition to the camera he had to suffer this on the wooden item to the massage he walked! "Ondrej after me came and told me - this, I do the pieces and notes just to make me not here because I want to go to the institute," described Lucia the moment when she fully understood what is happening behind the door of the garson. And the wishes of the
His condition was so important that the family was taken up after shooting and placed for a month in the Educational Care Centre in České Budějovice. To his father and substitute mother Aneta (28) he returned shortly, but then he traveled to the diagnostic institute for problematic children. "When I came home, so Aneta immediately added me to the facebook, we wrote for a while. More interested in whether we got money. I didn't respond to it at all. But then I wrote that the little was in the Institute that they then returned to them, now they are in diagnosis. They are both two without work," said Lucia from Pilsen.
Of course, the flash also addressed the other side, but received only a fragile answer. "I have no mood, I am sick, call later," said Aneta and hanged the phone.

Prague stock exchange grew slightly with Czech banks, O2 or Avast
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the business week with a slight growth. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. The Czech banks, O2 telecommunication company and Avast technological company were upwards. On the contrary, the Austrian titles and CME media company were not able to achieve the results of trading on the website of the exchange.
After most of the Friday session, the Prague Stock Exchange trading in a slightly positive territory and finally finished with a small profit. "Nevertheless, during the week he lost (index PX) slightly more than one percent," said Josef Dudek of Fio Bank.
The commercial bank improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast’s shares were estimated by 0.89 percent to CZK 113 and O2’s operator added 0.46 percent to CZK 2.50.
The Kofola securities rose by 1.38 percent to 294 CZK, and Philipp Morris, whose shares were irritated to 13,640 CZK, obtained a few percent.
CEZ’s energy securities stagnated to a quarterly value of CZK 520.

The crown slightly weakened against the two major currencies. The euro lost four galleries to 25.85 CZK/EUR, a dollar of three galleries to 23.62 CZK/USD, resulting from the data on the Patria Online server.
First arrangement
Covid's pandemic slows down, but experts don't expect a major return for the next weeks.
The pressure in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time, and the pandemic equation was added, as well as known, to the new unknown: the variant of omicrons, which is very likely to spread faster than currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet absolutely sure to say whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or poststinphic immunity can help against it obtained prior to the disease.
However, this week the unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine, antivirotic molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by a paxlovid medicine from Pfizer, which is even 85 per cent of the results.
However, the first supplies of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in combating the coronavirus pandemic, highlighted the question of how the administration is ready for incoming drugs.
As it was said, first of all, Merck's molnupiravir will be available to domestic patients.
The company ended on the tape as the first, even because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic was launched to find suitable treatment for viral horse diseases in the South American continent.
For this research, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often concerned.
They are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and in particular Czechs, are accustomed to speaking "how we have grown up".
See a research where people ask whether they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of them will say that they are not.
In the West they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we are Czech racist beasts.
And then go and choose the parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancelling culture, saying this in the public means losing work and media link.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the West is good, the east is poor.
But find out what people think.
It is only in France Le Pen and Zemmir, both have more than 20% according to the survey.
French candidate for Oscar Bidnice will start the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and both actors from this year’s Berlinale awards, the director’s award and jury’s award, and many others will present the 6th anniversary of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. Even this year, the Be2Can festival will bring the selection of the most remarkable and stimulating ones that presented the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Bidnice, for which the author of the film Lad Li received the Jury Award at this year's Cannes Festival. The film is a French candidate for Oscar. The premiere of the film in Prague will personally present representatives of two main roles of police officers of the criminal unit, Alexis Manenti and Dibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also a co-author of the film's scenario.
Be2Can will take place this year in Prague cinemas Lucerna and Edison Filmhub, further in Brno (kino Art), Ostrava (Minikino) and in Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
The director of the year-round debut of the director Lad Ligo was successfully introduced and awarded at a number of other world festivals. The MFF Durban won the Best Film Award and the Best Script Award, then introduced at the MFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be presented in San Sebastian.
In the framework of the festival, the audiences can also look forward to the films of Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Violator, Sbohem, my son, Pardon, we did not stop you, the anthology of the city of spirits and the picture of the Golden Gloves. But they can also enjoy other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will focus on the Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, on the Czech triumph Colored Birds.
Even we know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Identical because of the rotation of units so that soldiers do not have to learn where they are, all objects are the same.
Of one, Atom Brda Museum and the remaining two are abandoned.
Sranda is that sssr did not have a nuclear head on its own territory, whether for safety or speed of deployment of heads because of a more Western position.
In those underground covers (in each picture there are two) only the heads were kept not the whole missile as they say.
If it was necessary to install this weapon, a special unit was arrived, which picked up this head and mounted on some bearing devices.
In addition to the museum painting, they are left in a desolated state.
Babiš in the memorial of the victims of terror called for security cooperation
On September 27, 2019, Premier Andrej Babiš and Monika's wife visited a memorial of terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, 2001, Ground Zero.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all the states of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States today, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš declared at the New York Monument of Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. The Ministerial President honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very impressive place," said the premier, accompanied by his wife Monika, she asked for roses with the name of Lukaš Rambisk and Czechoslovak emigrants Alena Sešinová. Both were among more than 2750 dead men who flew on a former pair of clouds of the World Trade Center (WTC), and the WTC towers were shocked up, now a monument with a name list of victims.
"It is necessary to recall what happened here, the threat," Babiš said. Attack against the USA of 11 September 2001 marked the Prime Minister for reasons why the United Nations should cooperate against international terrorism on a single track. Terrorists then, next to the destruction of the WTC clouds, arrived by an attacked aircraft in the Washington Ministry of Defence building and planned to attack another target in Washington, probably the White House or Congress. However, this aircraft appeared when the hijackers were built.
"This is our main enemy, all the states of the world should join and coordinate the fight against international terrorism," the Czech Prime Minister added.
At the second stage of primary school, we had a Gypsy colleague, 4 years we were with him.
It was quite fine, he did good fun, often too much manifested, but it was such our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, often walked and wanted to explain something, lacked little, walked regularly, sports worked with us, did not steal snacks, neither phones, walked purely garmented.
He went to schools in nature, made different opponents, but was cool, perhaps never a gap.
In the eighth or ninth class, they entered the same year, other classes.
Shortly, the teacher left, solved something by police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something to an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have already sold to Gypsies, the money has always been, they didn't try to attract me to the price, communication in peace.
I even sold this car as well, the boy in a month called that it was already overwritten..
I say about myself that I am not racial, I am one if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, until it behaves as in a decent society (works, works, women of heaven, just normal behavior).
But as somebody comes, pulls his hand, washs out the apartments and houses, has only an inconvenience around him, makes problems... so it's one that has a color, but it's worth me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they are involved, start businessing, working, learning language (not necessary, at least English), respecting our culture.
If I believe in Allah, it is one thing to me until I respect my tradition and culture, I will also be there.
Young woman died in the accident of cars in Prachatice
"Youth woman suffered serious numerous injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she was injured on the site," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for Southern Healthcare.
The accident probably failed the driver who took the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle is likely to move from the village of Žichovec to the village of Bavorov and, for undiscovered reasons, went to the opposite direction.
After the collapse, Škoda Octavia ended with the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the road, described the accident spokesperson for South Bohemian police Stephen Schwarz.
The young Peugotu driver suffered very serious injuries.
It was numerous injuries and remained spelled in the car.
After dismissal, she had to be provided with acute pre-Democracy care and in a stable state he was transported to the Czech Budapest Hospital, according to Fajtlová’s rescue officer.
She added that a man from the second car suffered lighter injuries to the chest and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not supply data
Lukáš Neuheisl orders abroad several times a month.
He organizes mainly collector cards.
“Usually it can be dozens of dollars, we’ll tell you, from ten dollars, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where it’s often free of charge,” the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small shipments has been slightly irritated, new VAT must be added and mailed to customs proceedings.
He will receive an email with the message that customs expect the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the shipment data, and if VAT has not included a merchant in the sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide customs proceedings alone, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, the entire process is not complicated.
I call one or two check boxes, I insert two attachments and I'm ready.
For me it is mostly a five-minute question, says Neugeisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rule, the daily number of shipments received from abroad declined to the international post in Prague from 60 thousand to 15 thousand.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for the delivery of data that are necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments to be processed on international mail.
If people complete all the data they need and fill them in time, so we would be about half here, says the spokesperson for the Czech Post Matiaš Vítik.

Inflation solutions
See the subtitle, how would you suggest solutions to current inflation?
We are currently 9.9% of inflation and are expected to grow further.
What should the state do, according to you, to slow or compensate for this growth?
Do we see a reduction in VAT for food and PHM in Poland, is this way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it sleeps?
Prices grow faster than they pay, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, mainly energy.
How many you have received, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year I was added to 2% in gross, which is laughing, but fortunately I have a similar income from businesses that operate at work.

The vote of the upper chamber of the Canadian parliament has been announced for several days by a well-known statement: Canada removes the honest citizenship of the former legend of the struggle for human rights, the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize to Aun Schan Su Tij. The current leader of Myanmar (Barma), who has spent years in domestic prison for his country's efforts to bring freedom, was an honorary title due to the proportion of genocide against the minority of Rogingo.
The decision to take Su Tij honest citizenship has already agreed to the lower legislature body a week ago, and the Senators have now unanimously supported it. "It is the right message for both her and Mianmar and the whole world," commented on the decision of her colleagues, independent Senator Ratná Omidvar. "We must clearly show that the perpetrators of genocide here in Canada are not welcome - the more honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament does not change technically for Su Tij, it is only an honorary title, but at the symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of a long-term fighter for human rights to the atrocities that the army of most Buddhist Myanmar has committed for infinite months on the Muslim minority of Rogingo is inappropriate.
The fact that the officially organized genocide occurs in Mianmar and that Su Tij - de facto Prime Minister there - completely failed to protect her citizens, has recently brought a UN report. Specifically, the names of several military commanders who, according to the investigating team, should be before the court for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "want both the feasibility of their actions and a huge extent". Su Tij and her headed administration, according to the United Nations, have committed co-occupation primarily by the fact that the actions of the wing soldiers and released around them to protect the fog of lies - for example, in the "anti-terrorist operation".
After the dissolution of Su Tij, five persons remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Rail Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gamccho, 14 Dalajlama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th imam Shiite Muslims and Malala Jusufzaj.
The Canadian Museum of Human Rights also reflected the development of an icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy, where information on the atrocities against the Rogings and on the parliamentary decision to take the title of an honorary citizen was gained by Su Tij profile. "We also underlined the coverage of her photos on a table capturing the timeline of the struggle for human rights, and we think that her shape will be replaced by a portrait of a Roging minority member," says the Canadian media spokesperson of Rorie McLeoda.
The only thing that is what Su Tij - at least so far - remains - is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Václav Havel's proposal in 1991 for a huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "Even though Ms Su Tij is regrettable at the same time, her award will not be cancelled," said the Canadian CBS Chief of Nobel Foundation Lars Heikensten.

Supreme State Prosecutor renewed the prosecution of the mother who manipulated the daughter against the father
The Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagreed with the forgiven mother who had long-term manipulated her daughter and violated her relationship with her father. She faced a suit of tyranny and threatening education. The Regional Court sent her a suit, Zeman disagreed with it. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a criminal offence can be seen.
The decision of the Supreme Court could have a wider impact on the next cause. "The more specific definition of such specific forms of tyranny can be considered necessary in terms of the directive of further application practice," Zemanová says.
The District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of the tyranny of the entrusted person and the dangerous upbringing of the child, creating a strong, to symbiotic relationship with her daughter, even in a situation where her father was to be entrusted.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significant negative relationship to the father. The situation noted the emotional development of the daughter, which was even hospitalized, and threatened with self-injury in the case of transfer to the father's care.
The Svitavian Mother's Court imposed two years of imprisonment with a two-year conditional delay, but the Pardubic Branch of the Regional Court simplified the appeals by the woman, not in criminal proceedings. The same verdict reiterated the Regional Court even after the Supreme Court had once ordered him to resolve.
The Regional Court stated that the situation when one of the parents manipulates the child against the other is not exceptional; it is decided in caution proceedings, or through psychologists or youth social protection bodies; only exceptional is the solution of criminal law.
According to the highest state prosecutor, however, the woman allowed both tyranny and threatening education. "The accused began entirely targeted when she incited negative feelings against her father in her daughter, and the targeted negative emotions confirmed. Such negotiations not only followed an illegitimate intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with minors, but it was necessary to know that the psychosocial sphere of minors causes negative consequences," he said.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once again to the Regional Court, and the child is now in the care of the father.

Would someone be able to explain why provenly convinced violents send themselves behind the grid for only 6 months?
This head simply does not know how the court can only send for 6 months such animal behind the grid only to do it again as it comes out.
6 The month is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relations in general.
And this does not mention that the victim of rape may never be remembered.
Doesn't this disagree with the potential future reports of rape to the victim?
The first mission of Christ went finally to herself: She met a few kilograms and wake up immediately
The first modern mission of 1989 by Ivan Christ (49) had long years of overweight problems, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental problems. She suffered because she had changed much since Miss Czechoslovakia. Now it seems that she took those spikes to her heart and with excessive balls she went to battle, even when she runs on a long track.

After a period of time, she decided not to undermine the strict modeling rule, which she ordered to be as slim as often as possible. She decided to stop listening to and started to transport what she wanted to.
But from the hungarians she moved to eat, which was immediately signed on her character, and she tried to disguise herself with various free clothing, which she added to the boiling shapes.
Now it looks like Ivan really went to herself, visibly losing weight, she started dressing tastefully and belonging to her fuller character.
All the present surprised the baptism of the book Miloš Zapletal (75), that she woke up again and already has the features of a charming brunette, which entered history in 1989 not only as the first victory of Miss after the revolution, but also the controversy of her victory.

Repair of the Krkonoše museum will have a year of delay
The administration of the Giant Mountains National Park (KRNAP) shifted the term of offering to the second tendency to repair the Giant Mountains Museum in Vrchlabí. The original term of opening the cover was September 20, told the spokesperson for the National Park Radek Dragni. The reason for shifting the term for offering is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price that we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, the work will begin as soon as possible," said Dragni.
KRNAP wanted to have a selected supplier of construction parts by the end of last year and start construction works in spring this year. According to the management of the National Park of European Grant 123 million crowns, the project is not at risk.
The KRNAP administration failed to choose a building company to repair the museum. The second competition was published this summer, because in the previous tendency, all companies significantly exceeded the estimated price of 65 million at that time. Offers exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is located in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should ensure the construction part of the project. The total costs including the construction of new exhibitions are estimated at CZK 210 million. Now the excluded object should be created by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the KRNAP Visiting Centre.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be the story of nature and people situated in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and life, should serve as a representative entrance gate of the Giant Mountains. The Visiting Centre should provide the most understandable form of information about the past and present Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover and protect the mountains. The Centre should also take over the role of traditional museums. The Centre will also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theatre performances or lectures under the wide sky. The plans are to build a new entrance to the object, create a bad or café.
A man from Grobe "burned" his girlfriend from Costomlat
A man from Groba unwillingly helped the guardians to ensure his national search for a girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was ordered to arrest.
He himself called them to her.
He went to the calls.
He first appealed to the surrounding and thought that he was stolen.
After calling to the emergency line, the guardians arrived at the place and were not enough to see when they allegedly said that they all thought that guards would arrive at the place.
In fact, he wanted to advise guardians on how to submit notifications to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of a man and his girlfriend, the guardians found that the woman was on the list of searched persons, in a national search, and arrest order was issued.
The case therefore deals with the CDM.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally believe that we are not ethnically or culturally speaking for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with me that the damage that Churchill was not able to ensure the liberation of the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Unexplained death of a girl (†8) in Příbram: There is no penalty
The unexplained cases are called "memorialists" in the criminalist blank. However, they are investigated if new information appears after years. Especially as regards the death of the child. In 1980, Crimeality Jiří Markovich managed to investigate the murder of two girls in the Prague Prokopský valley old then for 12 years. "The case from 1955 will be difficult, very difficult. It would be for the beginning to find a list, no longer exist, to talk to those who examined it. Hope is always, but it would be really difficult," says Marković.
In the past regime, the public was not too informed about violent crimes, but Markovich definitely does not mean that they would be examined laxically. "Whenever it depends on specific people," criminality thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s can be destroyed, even if unclosed cases should not be merged.
Technological companies want to rule our city
In 1992, on the top of the wave of liberalism, followed by the end of the cold war and the fall of the iron curtains, this politician in his most famous book The end of history and the last man wrote: "What we may witness... is the final point of the ideological development of mankind and universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of rule."
Six twenty years later, we are witnessing how from the USA to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy will win more models of non-liberal and gifts with different forms of nationalism and radicalism. The current ninth Fuquiam book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment attempts to align themselves with the succession of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for New Statesman shows, many of his former opinions are reassessed: they claim that the ideas of socialism should return back to public space and Marx had much truth. At the same time, he insists that his ideological development is still in line with the position of the nineties and criticizing the End of History and
"What I said at that time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than just... Liberal democracy does not even try to define what is a good life. It leaves it on individuals who feel alienated, do not see meaning, and therefore join groups according to identity that give them a feeling of synalergy."
At its time, the book End of History and the last person was written as a strong argument against Marxists who perceived communism as a final stage of history. When Fuquiama asked how now he perceives the relationships of socialists in Britain and the USA, he answers: "This matters what socialism you are mining. If we are interested in the ownership of manufacturing resources, then except when a clear public service is requested, it will not work. But if you think of the redistribution programs that are trying to solve a huge imbalance in income and wealth, we are already witnessing, then yes. I think not only that he could return, he should return, but also a long period that was started by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, and in which certain types
Finally, Fuquiama is trying to calm the current situation, and all liberals warn that neither the onset of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
But I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without proof just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case personally as a right faith.
Here I can't agree with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world if I don't weave something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in some of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will irreparably punish you if you believe in another god.
However, it is in the tenth that there is no god other than Jahveh.
Therefore, it would not be more rational to refrain from faith in any god than risking that of the thousands of gods to choose wrong and that one real god I did not treat, will send me to hell or to a similar place?
Unwritten wants 45 million
The Ministry of Justice, according to the spokesperson's office Vladimir Repka, has received six requests in this context and is now analyzing them, and the young woman was in prison for two years, but the justice finally simplified his guilt.
The caution was not given by both Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman and Minister of Justice Maria Benešová.
The attempt to murder Hairstylists in Horice became in February 2013. Hradec State Prosecutor's Office appealed to the twenty-year-old student of the Uncategorized Gymnasium. The complaint claimed that the woman had been hit several times in the head of the flesh and then gathered her over ten thousand crowns. Her son was seriously injured, her life saved by her doctors of the Hradec Hospital.
"I am innocent and swears. I am sincerely sorry what happened to be damaged, but I am not the perpetrator," said young people who did not deny that there was a destiny day in the hairdresser's office. He left after the woman told him that she was already closing. He was then invited to the police as witness.
Hairstylists first discovered him as an aggressor during the hearing, but later declared him as an attacker. According to court experts, she suffered after the attack of memory.
The Hradec Regional Court in the case of gradually imposed five judgments: first, the Unbelieved twice confessed the guilty and imprisoned him for 16 years, the appealing Supreme Court reduced his sentence to 13 years. The Unbelieved gradually directed the grid twice, but after the intervention of the Supreme Court, he was released. After the ordered replacement of the court, he finally fell repeatedly forgiving the sentence, with the last last year in March the Supreme Court confirmed.
However, the President of the Senate of Appeal Jiří Lněníček, in justifying his conclusions, stated that this decision was bad, but due to the procedural situation in the absence of a better opportunity. He said that the appeal by the State Prosecutor against the simplifying verdict rejected, despite its appeals were legitimate.
"The problem of this matter is not that there would be a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that there were enough evidence in the preparatory proceedings that would be rich enough in other criminal matters for the recognition of guilt," Lněněček said.
However, the Hradec, as well as the Supreme Court, looked differently at the cause, and their views would probably not change when the exempting judgment was repealed.
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X-months of training (in different specializations, X-months per one) and under the leadership of professions with practical experience.
If a person knows well, he can get a professional offer.
All ingredients of the Czech Republic would fit something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say as follows: The cooperation between the educational sector and industry has continued to be mistaken, the company hunts at schools and takes place some delay when the labour force migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only adolescents, but this process is constantly taking place, each of us constantly learns something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar penetration should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, German or, for example, Mongolian rider will never proceed here.
It will come funny to me, as you consider NATO to be something pulled out into the stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if there is a gap.
But you'll delight the panba.
Just one election in the United States that will cry out their budget and the whole NATO goes to learning.
The English exchanges us for Russian dust, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Police once turned out to show them back and take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence is armed army after the teeth and the population who can control the military equipment of their time.
And today they can pilot remote control of the means of each teenager so that it would not happen.
We don't need border fortification, this is today to come, but hang the teenager behind the remote controlled device.
Kovosvit sells an administrative building and other halls. Expects worse times
Because of the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, the consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Among the main problems of the Cookbook series, the shortage of employees and the shift of subcontractors. This year, the demand for machining machines decreased by 10 to 20 per cent annually. "This is due to the expected decrease in turnover by ten per cent," said the Director-General. In 2017, Kovosvit was 1.3 billion crowns and profits after taxation of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers to sell several properties, halls and land that either do not use, or only at least. It concerns administrative buildings where two of the five floors are used, and not completely. "The part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, to improve its activities. The sale of property is not part of any current solution, for example, cash-flow, but part of the long-term plan, when we want all resources to devote to investment development," said the Director General.
About half of the production of Kovosvit exports. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, the Chef ranked among the most interesting India, where he gained a Kovosvit order for machines allowing a 5-axis machining value of CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two 5-axis machines for CZK 30 million to China. "Another order in the same volume that we would like to meet before the end of the year," Kuchar said. On the Russian market, even else Kovosvit faces restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May added another machine, another one should be delivered at the end of the year or the edge of 2020.
The main corporate investment in this year was the transition of heated from steam to hotwater for 20 million crowns. The sprout employs 500 people, the average working wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for cast skates for the foundry, machiners, trainers and electricians.
Since September 2016, the company owns an industrialist and weapon Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the manufacturing of machining machines. In 1939, Tomáš Bata founded it. The company had up to three thousand employees.
Thank you for dancing! The singer Leonard Cohen will be released after the last album
Thank you for dancing (Thanks for the Dance) will contain unpublished materials and various musical collaboration that gave together the singer son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album Yi Want Out Darker was released, which Cogen collaborated with his son Adam, asking him to help him complete individual songs. On his intimate recording, Cogen symbolicly coincides with the coming death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cogen began working on the materials that remained after his father, calling for collaboration with a number of musicians - Damien Rice, Brice Dessner, Javier Mase or singer Beck.
"When we thought music for father's words, we used his own characteristic musical procedures, so they are still with us," he said to the album Adam Cogen. "It is impressive to him for the reactions of those who have already heard him. One after another says Leonard still lives," he added.
"I'm almost alive, I'm almost at home," he sang his characteristic Cogen honey voice. He sang about death, found that the release of the new material would not survive. He recognized it in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it's not too unpleasant," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cogen issued a collection of poetry of his father The Flame. The Czech will be published under the name Plamen on December 31 at Argo publishing house.
How not to drown in box tsunami
Do you wrap gifts under a Christmas tree and at once you are filled with boxes and fillings at home?
This "waste" re-uses e-shops that miss packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops was created, which your boxes used welcome.
And not only about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, the damage to them is treated as a disposable waste.
Anyone can, upon agreement, bring to the interconnected trade (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste generated and avoid overfilled blue containers.
Shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently insufficient in the market and also saved money, as the packaging cardboard has irritated by 50% over the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, they strengthen their brand.
One of such shops is TIERRA VERDE, the manufacturer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling materials to us in Popovek near Brno by individuals who collect at home are also asked to us by companies with which we have agreed regularly shifted cardboards.
We use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more comprehensive world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature with other generations, says Petra Lopushnikova from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only shopping places for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (when to deduct sorted waste from the household, where to deduct passed medications, tyres, supplied electrics, batteries, light sources, large waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end in the right place, in addition, reuseable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project contains over 100,000 such places.
"Successfully, collective courts, reuse centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste," Miroslav Kubasek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklidme Czech Association, adds.
State companies managers have to newly browse the selection procedure. The law will be able to circumvent, hard opposition
"This is a typical draft law, which is unnecessary," said Zbinek Stanjura, chairman of the ODS membership club.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes that should prevent the untransparent distribution of functions - criticizing traffic calls - in state firms. The new applicants should undergo selection proceedings at the Ministry and will assess them by the government committee for staff nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, does not like ODS, because it is alleged that ministers will be allowed to exclude themselves from the possibility of poor selection of state managers, and the opinion of the above-mentioned ministerial committee will not be binding. The news must be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Speak me badly that today technology is so simple and fluffy that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or actually mobile phones simply hide the underlying file system with folders and all uploads to one screen in the app.
Quietly, let’s use technology from childhood, but especially let’s learn something.

Let's write history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency – starting in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they should not be prosecuted in a half year.
However, French politicians like it and like voters.
Macron supporters of the intersection between the right and the left match little, but just Europe yes.
And in France, new elections will be the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, inter alia, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately contributed to the criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and translates history.
In fact, this is trying to defend rewritten history rather.
The extremely right-wing candidate for French President Eric Zemmir is now circumventing France with the fact that the regime of Vichy, who collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad and has quite a success with the French.
Try to take Macron's idea of one textbook of history seriously and regardless of the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story to me versus them and never as a story in general.
Spanish, French, Czechs learn who defeated in which battle.
But if they do not have an illuminated cantor, they will no longer know what was the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?

The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the Father's film.

The plush environment in Tashkent was testified, in 2016 she won her first WTA tournament and started very sovereign this year.
After winning with Paolini, Kawa and Kužm, she fought among the four best toys.
But the match with Alison Van Uitvanck did not develop well for Christine. The Belgian held her submission and broke the service of Pliškov twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uitvanck went soon to the leadership of 3:0 and returned no longer to Christine, even when she finally managed to turn her one brackball. In the latter, one sword turned back, but the other came to an end.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Híský: Should Czechoslovakia refuse the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany?
Adolf Hitler captures an untapped image when visiting the Czechoslovak border fortification. The task of the fortress was never stopped by the German army, but to slow down its procedure before the Unions are involved.
If almost 81 years ago Czechoslovakia rejected the Munich agreement and would then face the German attack, what would eliminate the fighting of the most Czechoslovak soldiers? German tanks, aircraft, or perhaps artillery? Perhaps it would not be any of these weapons, be in them Germans over Czechoslovakia had a cruel advantage. The Czechoslovakian army would probably suffer the greatest loss - due to the bushes.
Hunted by a monument to the monument - A man in the tension calls for enforcement of the law
Who moves in a camp divided society and does not want to completely blame, welcomes the situation when he does not have to fantasy only there. When he can admit plus those who are otherwise criticized, so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to the previously allocated stickers. Such situations include a list of heavy damaged sights, which President Zeman grips on his favorite journeys to the regions.
Everyone knows what is going on. And who sometimes travels to the Czech Republic, a number of inherited monuments - from the centers of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - goes to his own eyes. Everyone knows that even here can come to the word demagogia. That if we squeeze advisers not care about the monuments or some threat in the territorial plan, it may be a work of former administrations. Or about the object of privatization, whose owner is not searchable. The head of state of local policy calls: "The paragraph of the monumental law allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not care for their property." But even if the owner is uncompressible, it is necessary to
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of the complex problem. But they are becoming a good thing like a squatter who does not recognize himself. Two years ago we wrote: "Through all squatters, all squatters draw attention to the problem standing outside the current interest. That the construction is in an emergency state." And we encourage the President to do de facto the same.
If you arrive in the historical center of Yachimov, you ask how it is inherited - including houses with Renaissance core. At the time when Yachimov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and tolaro destruction (for the US dollars). Why? Due to the rapid sale of houses in the 1990s, the officials say. But what is that seven kilometres remote island, the seat of Šlíko, the seat of the Yachimov tolars, has a historic core nicely repaired? Is it good, if the President notes these things.
Trains begin to ride according to a new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday, trains start to the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some tracks, such as between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet begins to ride instead of the Czech roads.
For most lines only modify the departure time, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the colleges.
The carriers started selling tickets in autumn.
Czech railways plan to tell on average 6783 passenger transport connections daily on average of 478 remote trains.
The train runs around 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
The roads alongside national connections under the new schedule will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, has dozens of new trains.
The main news will be Interet trains that will ride on lines from Prague to Cheba.
Another new train carrier will explore in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the price of the ticket from next year by an average of 3.2 per cent.
The roads take into account inflation into their tariffs every year.
The largest change in RegioJet’s timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Melník – Nimburk – Kolín.
After success in the competition, the Ministry of Transport will replace the Czech Railways.
Daily RegioJet will tell a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped in the stations of Havličkov Brod, Ždar nad Sazavou and Cologne since Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two backbone connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to the speaker Emil Selarik, the carrier tried to preserve the most similar time of travel of his remote trains despite the planned extraction work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier is also replaced in some regional routes.
The changes are waiting for passengers to Czechoslovakia, for example, where trails from Mladá Boleslav through the Czech Lipa to Rumburk will ride instead of the Czech trails Trilex German company Die Länderbahn.
Travelers will also be able to use uniform railway tickets for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price increases by 3.2% inflation.

I have to disagree.
Perhaps we will not learn the view of the other side?
We all hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were pushed and had to drill, died.
In my life I have not heard teaching from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
Nobody will tell you in schools that blacks were often sold to slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
Nobody teaches you that colonizers often bought soil from Indians everywhere, just tell you how brutal we, Europeans, murdered them, while murdered long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in Southern.
I did not encounter that someone would deliberately silence the facts, but I heard earlier that this is happening and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (especially in Japan there are atrocities from WW2 quite a taboo).
My point was rather that history was not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in some sensations, it's just what is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the matter from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, when we are already with those Southern states, yes, confederation flag and famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they had some good success and came to me absurdly to put them down.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as it is currently idealizing enough people.
And a lot of people also forget that not all of them in the South were slaves and enough things were also opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this with Russia, deliberately leave some facts, lies and manipulate them, in addition, our perspective doesn't exist (it was also a video from TV where someone started talking about our legionarians and 1968).
What came to me at US schools funny was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that never survived their land.
Overall, it came to me that at some universities it was scarce, those students were quite happy and those schools supported them once.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older once, I am a little evil of the fact that this could be the voice of most of them because they are among young people and in the ruler elite.
It comes to me that, for example, feminism has long achieved what he had and it is not about the same, he has been treated.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, leading to radicalization on the other hand, often leading to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical is someone, the more to hear it.
Anyway at the end, I also did not meet that someone would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I've met a bad geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I wouldn't like it here, but because I think it's absolutely unprecedented.
Should I be proud of something I could not alone?
In addition, the concept of nationality is generally considered to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If something with people takes me such interests, views of the world and common experiences, not the place where we were born.
Police accused CzechTourism Manager Aleš Pangrace of contracts for promotion
Police accused former manager of the state agency CzechTourism Aleš Pangrace of contracts for promotion. Pangrac server SeznamZpravi confirmed that he took the charge this week. Czech TV (ČT) last year stated that police officers in case they check contracts worth CZK 38 million. Part of the money according to the police returned to Pangrac, writes a server. In the causa, criminals were also interested in the Minister for Local Development Clara Dostalová (for YES), whose resort CzechTourism falls into the causa. Investigation in the causa according to the server continues.
Detectives from the National Central against Organized Crime provided evidence in this caution in the second half of November. For example, they were headquartered by the Ministry of Local Development, the headquarters of CzechTourism, the autodrome in Mosta or Sport Invest Agency. The service computer was also taken from the apartment of the Minister. In the court order for a home tour at Dostalov, who previously cited the ČT, it became that the Minister decided in 2016, when she was a deputy, on expenditures of CzechTourism in favour of elected persons intermediated and outside the standard official procedure. Then she declared that she felt absolutely innocent, undoubtedly, everything could document and fully cooperate with the police.
According to the agency, it was a doubt of the individual. The media previously stated that it was a former director of the department of regional partnership in CzechTirism Aleš Pangrace, who was appealed due to the results of the audit, according to the fact that CzechTirism concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me, but I don't want to say more about it," said Pangrac to the North List of Reports.
Toyota hydrogen still believes, prepares the second generation of Miray
Toyota Miray never had to be just a concept. Toyota thought so seriously with her that even though there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, yet she put it in the offer. Not so to a completely standard, the customer had to really target this car, but nobody else then offered this option.
Chef Toyoti Takeshi Uchiyamada at the international hydrogen conference confirmed that the next year a new generation will come. Toyota still believes that these cars have the future and hybrids are balanced in price within ten years. Of course, this is related to the development of pumping networks, but the future is associated with hydrogen as well as electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen with the needs of ecological operation not personal cars, but on the contrary, large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those vehicles that need to be overcome at one tightening of long distances, this purely battery version can not offer. Toyota could so, thanks to the great experience and long development, find new residences.
It remains to be reminded that, as well as Toyota believes in the hydrogen drive and Hyundai, which now offers hydrogen crossover Nexo.
Insect is up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is represented more than insects in nature. Brice, butterflies and other species form more than half of life on Earth. However, there are reports according to which insects of the empire dramatically decrease. Another scientific study on this topic has been published this week and the situation is still much more serious than mankind has so far realized.
The study is based on a terrain research in the tropical forest in Puerto Rico, where American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As it writes in the introduction of the report, insects are "ten times to sixty times less" today in forests. This is the loss of the whole population, i.e. not the number of species, with the research concerned not only insects, but all members. Because of insect eradication, the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or frogs.
The authors of the research find their conclusions in the direct context of climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years and warming has become the driving force of combustion of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems can be much greater than anticipated so far.
"It is one of the most worrying articles I ever read," said an entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whose letter is cited as an independent expert.
"We also have a loss of ordinary insects," notes Lukáš Čižek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the changes in landscapes that play a significant role in Europe. "We only have a considerably longer time than in Portorico," Chižek adds to an explanation why in forests, compared to the 70s, scientists could intend to fall so rapidly.
Nokia complains of the Brno company because of the name Lokia. People do not sleep us, believes Moravan
Nokia objected to Lokia’s application to the Industrial Property Office, but according to CCV, product replacement is not likely.
The Brno company developing CCV software is facing legal steps from the Finnish manufacturer of Nokia telecommunications equipment. Finoms do not like the program of the Brno warehouse management company called Lokia WMS, wrote the E15 diary. Nokia therefore objected to the Lokia brand application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV judges that the replacement is not likely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrašek said that the program has been using two dozen customers since last September.
"The Nokia name looks forward to recognition and confidence around the world. When someone tries to register a stamp that we believe can lead to a replacement or weakening of our brand, we will take steps to protect our valuable assets," said Nokie Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that the brand famous in the past by mobile phones in the formation of a warehouse program did not think of Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one kind of heavy duty whose rapid movement should be the analogy of warehouse movement.
"In the Czech market there is little likelihood of replacement. We sell modern cloud software to which companies equip their warehouse operations, and we really don't go to the area of mobile phone production. And we don't care about comparison to the brand that the industry may assure the train," said Tomáš Kormanák, CCV manager at E15.
CCV requested brand protection in August before launching the Industrial Property Office's market programme. "Protection was requested for products and services belonging to Class 9, 35 and 42, since software belongs to Class 9, related business management services in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and development of computer software to Class 42 according to international classification", said Ondrašek.
The Nokie objection is based on the fact that the older Nokia trademark is valid in all classes of products and services and thus applies to the widest possible spectrum of products and services, and therefore, of course, it is also covered in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not doubt the claim of the objector if this is the conformity on these classes of products and services, but it is indeed quite different brands focused on other target groups," Ondrašek said.
According to E15, the trademark dispute may take months and the company may complicate the activity.
I am not faithful, but of what I know, I can say this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes there, one is Ukraine and the other Slovakia.
The Slovak farmer is a terrible faithful guy, has a doubt rather about theology than about politics, but then always a coconut about the coronavirus that everyone is stuck.
Then there is of course the Church of Czechoslovak Hussite.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to the services of the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but members are mostly liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functional temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominican Square and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do the mess in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Betlem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Breclav – The flame bent in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts were not in Vienna due to the pandemic of the coronavirus, but in the morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues to the border crossing of Reintal – Breclav.
Last year they took it on the border.
The Bethlehemian light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate annually with the section, I look forward to it.
It is the honour for me that I was chosen, told the present journalists of the scout Amalia Budiková.
While last year the transfer took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal – Breclav at the parking lot.
Usually for him, the scouts ride by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes to the delivery of flame in the Czech Republic.
With the betlemic light, the scouts traditionally trained to Brno, where they passed it to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlém.
On Saturday, December 18, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, which will travel by selected quick and personal trains.
They will take light in the stations of local scouts or volunteers, who will then spread the flame to the Czech Republic and where the rails do not know.
Even this year, scouts must comply with valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It happens like last year.
We recommend both courier teams and organizers of local events to, of course, carry the knights, try to follow the steps, it was as little as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, she described the spokesperson for the betlemic light event Zuzana Hrbkova.
The betlemic light tradition, which travels to Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread at the same time with the flame of the idea of room, friendship and peace.
The Bethlehemian light is for believers a symbol of hope, the light that exceeds darkness.
Scouts and scouts have been taking care of in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event is worth hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of ignorance and human mutuality.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the foundations of the economy that confirm that subsidies to cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education makes proper use of the money, and I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and overall companies.
As mentioned - the unnecessary product is produced and it gains the free market and “natural life of the company”.
I am working in a factory where million signs are “xy financed/co-financed by the xi project” on the hallway, and such a company is simply artificially held in life.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs x people, this is the earlier development when this company holds and takes off contracts/employees to companies that could grow up and be more productive after its disappearance
Target talks? Ustská zoo seeks a new veterinary, nobody is interested in
Last late this month, the city leadership counts on the talks that came around the former director of the zoological garden and at the same time veterinary Václav Nourished that the targeted killed exotic animals he took care of, such as the female bearer Zamba, Kala elephant or Orangutana Nunaka.
The municipal council therefore announced a new contract. "For the veterinary care for the zoological garden with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the City Center for Animals in Emergency with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said Roman Macová.
Deputy Prime Minister Vera Nechibová (UFO) explained that the city has announced the competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživíl has to explain you unsuspectedly, I consider it a distinct degonestation of such a high-quality expert," she noted.
Experts specialized in exotic animals are very little. "It is certainly nothing pleasant. The zoological garden still provides veterinary care in the form of orders," said. Orders and contract costs the same money. "The garden, but what to finance must comply with the law on public procurement," explained speaker Nikolai Rostejnska zoo.
Václav Poživíl himself belongs to recognised experts. He participated in, for example, a unique operation in which Jane received as the first hepard in the world of total endoprotesis. He performed the functions of the Zoo Director from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous conversation on his person. Yesterday, he did not accept phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
With regard to the zoological garden contract, some pets mini, that in the zero interest of her, there is no need to be fear of similar purpose orders, as in his case, but just little information. For example, the mouth veterinary Jiří Král has not heard about her yet. "I hear it from you for the first time. Nobody has addressed us. Such a thing, I think, will quickly expand," he added.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she loved Lucy White!
The day before the baptism of the calendar Fuck The Age (in the translation of M*date Age) Simona Krainová published her last photos on which she is completely naked! "I had a little fear that my people will condemn that I am a naked picture at my age. I am a fairly stylish person. But yet I only have a positive reaction. I wanted to show that when I want it, it goes on at 46 years to have a solid character. Of course, it's behind the drift and remarks, but otherwise it's not possible."
"We photographed about three thousand photos with Lukáš Dvůrák, chosen about one hundred and in their calendar there are twelve, so the rest is still waiting for a while, but it is not the last thing I am naked," said Blasque model, who came to her baptism very revealed.
She had an extended bag from Bernhardt and under it the shorts that were not seen, so it seemed to have forgotten the bottom, every day her legs were reinforced, so similar models could afford.
Simon had such a pleasure for success that she loved the baptism of everyone she met. Married, friends, even Slavic Lucia White.
Complete consent, it is terrible.
Sometimes even the person who was born at the Internet time is also caught into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think Internet advertising with me is neglected, but then I'm just likewise catching out that I've been affected by it - it's just so so smashed that a person will not always defend it.
For this reason, I support radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to completely prohibit programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all the leadership, words classic - I would prohibit the Internet.
In the underground of the ČSA mine in Karvina burned, no one was wounded
In the underground of the ČSA Dol in Karvina this morning burned, the cause of the fire is not yet known, but nobody was injured, said for the ČTK speaker of the mining company Ivo Čelechovský.
The fire turned out at 04:25 in the fire in a depth of about 1200 meters. "Nobody of the employees was not injured, nobody was injured. On the spot, band rescuers immediately hit the fire, which was directly destroyed by the fire and carried out the search for the ground. The workplace was immediately closed and unavailable," the spokesperson said. The exact cause of the fire will now be found by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Carvinian reservoir, coal is used only in the Karvinian part, in the mills of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South. In the mill of Lazy, the mining company OKD is the only producer of black coal in the Czech Republic, its production was 4.62 million tons. In the mills it works for 9000 people.
I feel of this faith has roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe anything that most believes and makes sense, I'm not sheep, but I'm more happy to believe anything that is less likely, does not give it too much meaning, but it's important that I'll have my own original opinion about which I'll claim it's a critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything they say to the media"
3. "non-believable policy"
TVs missed the trend of Christmas films, their premiere are two hundred this year
Los Angeles – Cinema, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen down the trend of Christmas films and this year their audiences will present a record of more than two hundred.
It consisted of the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years in the public points out and significantly increases tracking, so these images are increasingly created.
This year, four times more Christmas films than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have Christmas (Vacation) in their name, so really there will be much more festive films.
Films that people traditionally connect with Christmas always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are mainly fairy tales with this period, worldwide images of the Sami at home, Love of Heaven or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful since 1946.
But the right boom of Christmas images started until 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came up with a special film series, he reminded the BBC server.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Counting to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to fit its viewers at Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
Competitive Lifetime station has 35 new Christmas films this year and a total of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story is not so important, it is important that there are plenty of Christmas trees in the background and that snows," said Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas films called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be at home on Christmas movies).
“For the audience, this is the form of leakage and the way to feel a little calm in the middle of all the festive madness and madness of the world in which we have lived in the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that will be solved successfully and the two will kiss.
This is still around, and as long as all movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, complement Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, it will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will express Abu Zabi in formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not intervene in the final season.
Become Haas so send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th section, which he qualified.
However, Rus Nikita Mazepin from the stable Haas finally does not interfere with the Great Abu Zabi prize.
It was positively tested for covid-19.
On the starting grid, only nineteen cars will appear, from the last partition of Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who in the direct battle will meet Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is, according to the stable Gaas statement, quite well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, with security being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," said her representatives for formula1.com.
The Gaas replacement rider will not send, nor can he send.
An alternative would have to complete a qualification or driving in another part of the weekend.
With covid-19, the first racer is not affected.
At the start of the final season he had covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year he was positively tested by Sergio Perez No. Lewis Hamilton.
They can close you for this.
And everyone will be stolen to say the boss.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
Then in the same group as HIV, marine, yellowish or typhos.

Cake in pond, or relatively well-being scan?
Babiš has chosen for his optimistic view of statistics such as good safety (Czech Republic is seven in the world), low unemployment rate, low state debt, or report that our country is, according to one recent study of the forty-eighth quality of life of 140 countries.
Developer Dušan Kunovsky and architect Josef Pleskot in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, however, mentioned others, not so "pink" data. Examples that the Czech Republic is in 154th place in the world at the speed of construction management. It may happen that the current economic "boom" will in itself leave no significant structural heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also slow, non-performing bureaucracy, which also document comparative studies in which the Czech Republic significantly fails in the overall quality and performance of public administration in advanced countries.
Our countries have simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of good economic situation in recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions increase, but people with better living standards will also want to have where to live, modern and rapidly travel, have quality cultural stands, live without an unbearable environmental burden.
However, for example, in the capital of Prague, it is not possible to complete the internal and external circuit or build a fast drag or subway to the airport for years. And Prague has neither a modern, architectural, courageous national library, a concert hall, nor a national gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd dragon on architectural competitions, territorial plans and building permits, but also some specific Czech conservativeism that holds passwords "every bolder change is worse".
President Václav Klaus even wanted to associate himself with the absurd drama around the "floor" of Jan Kaplický, designed for the new building of the National Library.
However, the list does not end in Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to get its backway motorway network, nor to start building train fast roads, so Germany finally decided to lead its way for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna "countries" through Bavaria. In addition, in the Schlendrian, there is a leckdy touching and repairing existing infrastructure, and getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now done a bus.
Babysius has come into politics with the promise that "this will shift". As for meaningful investments and acceleration of heavy-duty bureaucratic procedures, however, much has not yet happened. Since 2018, the amendments to the law on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure, but on the broader positive effects of the supplies of easier land recovery will have to wait. And a new building law approved by the government, which should shorten the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, begins, if we have luck, to pay in 2021. Many people would probably not belong to it.

Declaration of the end of the right in the House or Jakapak "right" coalition ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
In the media and comments, reports have recently appeared on the prepared coalition of the mentioned parties, many say that the "right" is finally given together, but I am rather asking why these parties are still referred to as "right".
When I remember the new movement of Trikolor, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right side. And it is absolutely one, as the individuals themselves mean or what are the labels of the mainstream media. ODS is the average of the top politicians of this party, the TOP 09 is a clear side of the city's pseudo-liberal left (which is shadowed for its left-wing, and so is covered as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, by its concept, ideology and voter targeting with TOP 09, essentially falls (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU even stickes itself for a long time as a central - their political compass is much more left than they say.
Do you feel that I have taken all of the water ready? Not, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I think myself as a classic liberal right-wing voter, for me the highest value of individual freedom, free market and minimum State interventions in the lives of individuals and the economy. As this general assumption of right-wingness of the parties fulfill? How many laws cutting the freedom of people to the Salam method, which confirm new regulations and growing supervision, increasing links to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness in recent years have supported? Good, really a lot. Not their own stickers, but they identify them. These parties, despite all possible declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives.
Coalition cooperation TOP 09, STAN and KDU would not look at at all, but the political map simply belongs to itself and except for Christian or on the contrary, homosexualist and gender aspects in them for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives, in fact, I do not see a distinction; however, ODS is long-termly rendered as a "one right" and connected with these three entities is no longer covered by revealing its genuine political inclusion.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers.You have noticed how often all these parties are absolutely concurrently and lacines mean the criticism of conductivity and socialism coming from the European Union as Pro-Russian agents? Can't or simply don't they understand that there are many people whom Eurosocialism and growing non-freedom are as strong as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do not hide the accidents of their complete argumentational incapacity and unreasonable or blind adoration of the Eurasian attitudes?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic no longer has a chance of greater success in the central policy. Perhaps such consolidated voters really want. Perhaps they want left-handed politics under the bottle of "right", because they are shadowed for their political belief (or they cannot identify him). I do not know, but I do not definitely belong to such voters.

Prindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely entered the semifinal MS
Kajakari Vit Prindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canyonist Tereza Fišerová safely went to the semifinals of the World Championships in the water slalom in Seu d'Urgell. Prindiš was in the Friday Qualifications of the Quarter, Prskavec Fifth and Fisher's Eighth. The next three Czech representatives will seek a semifinal start in Spain in the afternoon repair qualification ride.
Vávrínec Hradílek has not succeeded from a strong representative group of cayakars, who immediately at the beginning of the ride received fifty-second penalization for the wrong passage of the gate. On the contrary, you can already relax with Prskavec and focus on the Sunday semifinal.
"I set the goal of the first trip to the thirty-three, which has succeeded in me. No, I would be one, as I impacted, because on Sunday it starts a lot soon in the morning, so I hoped that I would be a little higher to have a better starting position," said Prindish and praised the well-being in Seu. "Before the race, I felt the hottest in 14 days that we were here. Then at the race it was good and today it was better. Throughout the time there are beautiful, nice races, the viewers came, so fine," wrote.
"In the qualification a man doesn't want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first gates, I didn't go completely. Then the middle was great, without problems and I knew that I was hired, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go down directly and turned the erk. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we will see how it goes on," said this year's general winner of the World Cup.
Both representatives praised that on Sunday they would go to the start at the end of the semi-final block. "I am not a bird in the morning, in addition, it is cold here after the morning, and when you are at eight, it wants to have a jacket and a hoodie," said Prindiš. "Total it takes a semi-final hour and a half, which is quite good difference in terms of sleep," said Prskavec.
From the triple Czech Singkanoisteks only succeeded Fisher, Eva Rihová ended with two seats for a gradual twenty-five, Kateřina Havličková was 35. "The rope part I sat according to the ideas, in the middle passage it came to me that I am not going down and going out according to the plan, but I could get to the comfortable track I wanted to go. I made two pieces and I was just behind the wins for a clean time. I have a good starting position to the semifinal," said Fisher.
The hunter wounded when falling from the posture, he was carried three hours to sanitation
An unfortunate accident occurred a half eight night ago in the top parties near Čertová mill.
"It was a very complex and unavailable terrain, so we told the injured man five of our rescuers with proper techniques. At the same time, we asked for cooperation of the Health Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The healthcare professionals then told the accident a sanitary vehicle," described the circumstances of the intervention of Libor Kluz, the dispatcher of the Mountain Service of Beskydy.
Rescuers found hunters in a printed location with numerous injuries, immediately treated it and then carefully, but difficulty transported on the so-called Austrian truck through the eastern terrain.
"Transport on the route of about one and a half kilometer was slow and difficult, so the injured nymrod was handed over to the crew of a sanitary vehicle for about three hours," Libor Kluz added.
According to Radan Jaškovský, appointed Chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service, and at the same time interfering rescuer, the colleague of the hunter fortunately managed to describe where the injury is located.
"We found it relatively quickly, however, if the Reserve app was on the phone, our rescuers would be sure before and at the same time know about the accident and its situation immediately dispatch line 155," Radan Jaškovsky noted.
He added that the charged mobile phone with the activated Rescue app should be in the mountains of course today.
Retreat, called Schiller for the words of the opposition dirty Czernin
"I consider it entirely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government, wherever, the less on the ground of Parliament, take such a totalitarian expression," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a breakthrough in the discussion of the proposal for a constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not seek enough votes and the proposal for a constitutional action with which the Senate came, the Members agreed from the table.
"I receive dozens of reports from people who do not know. There is no single voice in support of this appeal. There are reports on the support of the President and messages of the type, how the money of taxpayers is spent here, how the foolish empty straw is. And even I am allowed, I do not use hard expressions, one of them quote: It is opposition and senatorial dirty," the Minister of Finance said.
"This expression was part of the Nazi citizens of Jewish origin and communists of their political opponents. It is a totalitarian rhetoric, without honour of man and opinion," said Vice-President TOP 09 Czernin, who will meet in autumn for the post of party chairman with the first Vice-President Marketa Bakar Adam.
"I felt one of the many reports that I received tens during the negotiations of the House, their common denominator was disappeared over the continuing personal degonesty, which we witnessed in the domestic policy every day and which was also the main motive of the fourth meeting of the Chamber, that someone applies to himself, surprises me," she reacted to the ČTK Schillerová.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what with them
The Venezuelan Central Bank conducts internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to instructions from Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send it to the central bank of bitcoins and ethers, and then the bank pays cryptocurrencies to suppliers of this oil company. Employees also study the proposal that the central bank can count cryptocurrencies into monetary reserves, which are now at least 30 years old. With the withdrawal of four sources, Bloomberg said.
NEWS
The Venezuelan Central Bank and PDVSA did not reply to the request for a comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much the value of these currencies owns. The business has problems to get payments from customers by conventional channels, because large banks are not willing to trade entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payments of $700 million (CZK 16.6 billion) in Chinese jüans, because the parties failed to find financial institutions that would allow transactions.
PDVSA may not be happy to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require it to register on the stock exchange and undergo depth controls, so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use cryptocurrency and pay it to the entities to which PDVSA debts. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could arise when paying cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers are used to verify and record transactions decentralized Internet accounting book known as blockchain. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need of an intermediary. Only a few banks are involved in digital currencies due to problems with dirty money laundering and client information related to them and complicating compliance.
The cryptocurrencies after the debacle in 2018 experience a return to sunrise this year due to the expectation of their larger adoption by institutions and Facebook’s plan to come with their own cryptocurrencies, so they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but from the beginning of the year it has profit of about 130 percent.
Heavy competition for Škoda Kamik. Kia XCeed bet on rich equipment, at what price?
Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult charging model. It falls clearly between a compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves a larger siblings of Sportage, which is so direct response to cars such as Škoda Karok, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, XCeed bets even on the dynamic shapes of the body that weighing the rear part can remind the world of SUV shopping, popular in this part of the market primarily among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, it is not possible to include XCeed only on the side of the plastic versions of classic compacts, for example, Ford Focus Active. On the other hand, Koreans made much more changes on the body, so who does not want, Ceed in the shapes of the news may not even have to see.
Unlike compact hatchback or Ceed, XCeed also offers exclusively overfilled engines, so do not wait for the basic atmospheric fourteen-liter. XCeed starts with overfilled liter and offers overfilled sixteen-liter with 150 kW, reserved for HT version siblings. There is no sports degree. Turbodieseli 1.6 CRDi is offered only in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the combustion engine assists in reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay next to the manual for a seven-speed two-speed automatic.
The offer will soon grow by plug-in hybrid, i.e. an option that drives about six dozen kilometers only for electricity, then the battery can be charged from the normal socket.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
He is a little like portable jewelry and the creator puts in him half a year of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home the sweaters never carried too much," says Lebanon, who spent over his work 3000 hours over half a year.
Silkly bought in Italy, 24-karat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,” praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has another hook.
"I'm completely on the other hand, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," says Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, was “only” CZK 720 000.
If MZ is deterred from reality or not too bad - let you travel a defective circuit and replace for a new one.
The fact is that the withdrawal of the FB from Europe would very help its non-Russian parts (and under the influence of the Holt resin).
I think it would clear the social climate quite enough.
Alternatively, it would be better to clarify the channels of "Soviet brotherly assistance" to some of our political parties and representatives.
Then people who are willing to have more clearly, they are actually interested in.

Sparta does not want to arrive in Pilsen about Tettega. She appealed against a double-smuggling punishment
Football Sparta appealed against a two-way punishment for the attacker Benjamin Tetteh, who received from the disciplinary commission for exclusion in the Sunday derby with Slavia (0:3).
The airline club informed him on his twitter and is now waiting for a verdict of the appeal committee.
Half of the punishment, Tetteh has already retired in the middle match of the home cup in Jihlava. Sparta is now seeking a twenty-year-old Ghana attacker to enter the 11th round of the first league in Pilsen on Sunday.
The situation could be repeated last October, and Olomouc then appealed against the punishment for Simon Falt, who received a distance from the disciplinary commission for one match for exclusion against Liberec on Thursday.
The appeal commission did not have to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the sentence was delayed and Falta could come paradoxically against Sparta on Saturday.
In the next week, the Commission confirmed a single-gathering punishment for the Olomouc hostage and Falta left the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinary Tetteh stopped working for faul on Slavic David Hovork, for which he received a straight red card at 82. minute from the arbitrator Miroslav Zelínka.
The alleged pop-up of the Ghana player on Captain of the opponent Tomáš Sička was not proven.

Petra Chernotska changed the image and did well! In light hair she was smiling
The film Saxan Petr Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Even when she celebrates her life jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner, and now she helped. She changed her image until her colleagues recognized her.
Actress Petro Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who should have a woven-gray color, wearing stuffy things and sporadically expressed herself into society, and the older herself, the more she can unlock her image.
Fortunately, the trend of plastic surgery was not subject to, and the skin was carefully used by an old good indulone, and its recipe against wrinkles was washed out, but now it changed the hair color and completely woke up.
When she came to a social event where celebrities faced summer, no one could know Peter, not only had lighter and shorter hair, but was still dressed in a yellow coat, which even more illuminated.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even at the threshold of seventy may risk looking, and Petre paid it, looks like a maximum of fifty.

Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of the lipstick: Not just one red
When choosing red lipsticks, you should first determine whether you are warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at wrist chairs. If you are in blue, you are cold type, if in green, then belong to the types of warm. When choosing a new red lipstick, put first of all just on the scattering based on the subtone. When you look at the texture.
If you advise women with cold subtones, then lipsticks are suitable for you in purple, plum, cherry or mauve colors.
If you fall into the category of warm skin subtones, choose such lipsticks, according to the desire for orange, coral, gold or brown pencils.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and other blue. In this case, congratulate - you do not need to look at the subton and you can focus only on your color preferences.

The end of political traffic? The new law according to critics will not help!
However, according to some opposition Members, the law rather records that ministers deprive themselves of their responsibilities of election and continue to elect their candidates.
Increased transparency in selection proceedings in state firms - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. For example, 119 MPs, for example, the law passed through the votes of YES, CSČM, social democrats and even Pirato.
Candidates to state companies will have to go through the selection proceedings before the government committee, for example, the Pirates have sought to be binding on the Minister's recommendation.
The civil democrats and the SPD Movement are concerned that the nomination law will be recorded to ministers. "The new minister will be able to hide for any decision of the Commission and will not be clearly transparently responsible for this fall," says Tomio Okamura, President of the SPD. Similarly, Vice-President of the ODS Martin Kupka.
The Governing Committee should completely refuse candidates who will not comply with the conditions; there will be criminal impunity, debtlessness, minimum age of 25 and the main selection criterion should be expertise.
The law will still have to pass through the Senate and will then be signed by the President.
The government approved the sending of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, explorers and pilots of drones could go even before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They have Polish colleagues to help protect the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with several months of ongoing action by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle East countries with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating in Poland.
President of the police departments Štěpánek resigned, wants to live as a free man
The President of the Independent Trade Union of Police Milan Štěpánek decided to leave the position on Friday, Czech Radio - Radio Journal. The departments of Štěpánek led since 2005. The chairman of the trade unions will remain for two months.
"I can confirm that this week I gave the presidency a written resignation, after which I will perform the functions of the fullest two months," said Štěpánek Radiojournal. "I decided as a free person who does not want to be invited to the trade union forever, and who wants to live a more peaceful life," said the reasons for the departure.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic associates members and employees of security councils or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. The union, among other things, participated in police protests against cuts in the budget or petitions for better conditions for security councils. For example, in 2011, he also entered into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior, Radek John, and organized a petition for his withdrawal. The leadership of the government coalition later agreed on John's departure.
From Sydney to London in four hours? Maybe reality in 2030
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to drive the aircraft twice higher speed than the Concordi aircraft. "When the Sabre engine is put into operation, it could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. For example, the distance between London and New York would be injured in one hour.
The Independent server notes that so-called hypersonic flights, at which the sound speed exceeds five times, are complicated due to overheating of the engine, but Sabre (Synergy Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should be dealt with due to the use of super cold helium, which should prevent temperature rise.
"The most important thing on Sabre is that this is a hybrid of the rocket and aircraft engine, which is powered by the flow of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll from Reaction Engines. "The rakes have not passed so much in the last 70 years, while the aircraft are yes. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient drive system and essentially create a spacecraft," he added.
The engine is currently tested, while trial flights should start approximately in middle of the next year, then commercial flights around 2030.
I have a heart like a bell and a lung of a non-smoker. Just give a few infusions, Zeman sacrificed
On Tuesday, the Head of State undertook a medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (UVN). According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavorala doctors did not find any "protection states" from the President. The President celebrates on Saturday 75th birthday.
Doctors at the president's control revealed slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by insufficient racing. "To manage the organism's dehydration, I will give me a few infusions to get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
However, according to him, the director of the UOH stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the President mentioned that Zavoral received several hate messages due to the medical tour.
According to the president, doctors watched him thoroughly and did not leave the only place on the body. "Also brief recapitulation: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if it was not a chicken, the liver works like I was abstinent, the kidneys are also okay and I can continue further and further," Zeman said.
The editor of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement of his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became the topic primarily during the last year's presidential election or during some public performances, in which Zeman has clear problems with walking. According to the Prague Castle, the president is poorly going due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. The problems also have low pressure and mountains hear. Due to his health, he reduced smoking.
On holiday only with a payment card? NEO account offers selections from ATMs worldwide for free!
Directly to pay cards, according to surveys, has already been used about half of all Czechs who expose to abroad. The main reasons include, in particular, comfort, safety, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often connected with the payment card.
“Pers who travel more frequently, for example because of work, do not have time to go repeatedly to exchange cash. Neither “satisfactory” nor “satisfactory” they do not rely on enough cash for them. Some foreign currencies are also Czech banks or exchangers or do not dispose of them. Therefore, we decided to choose cash from all ATMs for NEO accounts free,” says Kateřina Petko, Marketing and Communication Director and Expobank CZ.
In addition, the payment card represents a much more reliable way to avoid cash against cash. When losing the full wallet, its owner no longer has to wait for the money that he had in it. However, if it comes only to his payment card, it can easily be blocked by phone or via Internet banking immediately. In rapid negotiations, no financial loss may be suffered. "Saving money in the bank account has, in addition to their reliable protection and other advantages. For example, for the NEO account it is 1.6% per year, which belongs to the highest among regular and savings accounts. Its establishment and management takes place online completely without the need to visit the branch. In addition, money in the bank account is insurance up to €100,000 and account management is completely free," adds Kateřina Petko
For everyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be of course. Thanks to the possibility to negotiate it and pay online cards, it is possible to do for the last moment. However, only the ownership of the payment card itself means insurance protection in travelling. "Example of MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part in foreign journeys to all countries of the world. The owners of these cards can also insurance their family with which they travel. Often they are waste of any other arrangement," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always appropriate to verify the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether all activities that travellers have in plan to do.
Medal basketball players from the MS under 17 years were not reached, ended fourth
The third seventy-third MS won the Americans who defeated Spain in the finals at 77:75 even over 40 points of Spanish Angela El Salvadores.
"We wanted to win and not be potatoes, but perhaps we wanted too much. We caught the beginning, but it could not be maintained because they prevailed under the basket," regretted Captain Karolina Malečková. "But it was an incredible experience before such a public," praised fans in Klatov and Pilsen.
The Czechs began very well, thanks to two triples, the leadership took 8:0 and dominated the entire first quarter of the playground. At that time, it seemed that the opponents would pay for the defeat from the basic group 85:88 after renewal, but the arbitrators sanded 15 faules in half an hour and disputed decisions helped Hungary return to the game of cord 12:2.
"I am convinced that it was enough to give two more three baskets, flee to 20 points, and we wouldn't let it out, but instead our mistakes came. I am not interested in the arbitrators, but what we did wrongly, and there were mistakes that helped the opponents to catch," said Richard Fisek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a concentration case, but the girls were fighters, they didn't miss anything and fought to the end, but the opponent was a lot of quality," he added.
The Czechs held precise shooting from the remote and pivot Tereza Šipova in the game, but the best Czech shooter had a faula problem, and a large part of the third quarter on the playground was missing. Hungarians used it and gained a mild jump that they had already maintained, although the Czechs fought until last seconds.
"For us, the first five matches were very demanding, we turned the matches in a narrow rotation and became a lot of forces. It was already visible against Spain that they were tired of and were not where to take. Because of the physicians, we were not consistent in defence. We did not play a quick counter-attack, we were missing jump. And Hungarians are so high that when you do not promise everything together, you are so hard to win," Fisek added.
"For two years girls have been able to win the Youth Olympiad, be the second at the European Championships of the sixteen years, and now they are the fourth in the world. Our attitude is a good team and it is necessary to continue working with him and develop talents. Now it is at the federation that the trainer will allocate to them in higher categories," Fisek added.
Omikron mutations spread in southern Moravia?
Hygiene checks another case of the child from Adam.
“We have actually reported additional suspicions of this option for another child from Adam from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov University is not demonstrated,” said Cyupek.
In the week there were six cases in the region.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of variants in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the Director.
She added that it is two nurses from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adam School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adam.
Three of them have, according to the Director, slight symptoms, four unsymptoms.
Nobody suspected of Omikron travelling abroad
None of these traveled abroad, nor none of their families, nor contacted anyone who would stay abroad.
The relationship with the waterfield championship is not in any of the above mentioned, said Cyupek.
The main hygiene Pavla Svrčínová previously stated that an international tournament in the water field was checked in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa and one Belgian player after returning.
California limits the sale of weapons.
He wants to proceed as Texas when you ban abortions.
On Saturday, Guverner California Havin News announced the plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous US state through the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions carried out after the detection of embryo heart rate.
People should then be entitled to compensation in the action of anyone who produces or sells attack guns and firearms in California.
Newsoma reacted to the Friday opinion of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texai ban on abortions in force, to be against almost 50 years of an old precedent verdict, which provided for the right to abortion on a surface throughout the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has not now decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical question that arises from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the prohibition was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack its usual trip.
“I am encouraged by the Supreme Court of the United States (February) decision yesterday, which allowed the preservation of the Texa ban of most food services and to a large extent supported the manoeuvre of Texas to protect its law,” said the California Governor.
“If the states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” News continues.
He, in collaboration with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice, mandated him to work on measures that would justify the public representative to enforce the prohibition of attacking guns and so-called weapons of spirit.
This is marked by a weapon that does not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
News wants to have “private citizens” the right to require compensation of at least $100,000 (over CZK 200,000) and court excuses from anyone who would virabel, distribute or sell attack guns, components of “arms of spirits” or sets for their production in California.
“If it is the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons outside our streets, creating a threat to private actions, then we should do so exactly,” said the California Governor.
The AP Agency believes that California has forbidden the production and sale of some weapons of army style for decades, but in June the Federal Judge blocked the ban as constitutional.
The words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who, in the disagreement with the opinion on the Friday majority verdict, warned before the enlargement of that legal mechanism to other American states, would be confirmed if the state actually renewed by the Texas template.
However, the Supreme Court did not recognize full immunity against the judicial review and allowed food clinics to continue complaints against selected US officials.
Each emergency vaccination has its public test phase, when it gradually comes to how the vaccination scheme will look like and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already in a large roll.
And according to these studies, up to five times increases in antibodies in most patients, which has already mentioned long-term effect.
Just like every other vaccination will have its vaccination scheme for time, only soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine should not enter the market, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.
Quantity learns to leave calmly.
But revalue what learns.
Since the time of Maria Terezie, our civilization and technology has advanced a little, and teaching telephone lists and descriptions of textbooks in the workbooks no longer makes sense and is the fact of losing time.
In these things, it would be brutal to remove.
On the other hand, how many people go from the base with some basic financial literacy?
And other things that will need to be needed for life?
How can I legally watch the online Championship League?
Do you not know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Championship League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and pay the Telly Sports Package for the Spanish and English Football League.
It does not include the UEFA League of Masters.
I think O2 offers the League of Masters, but I do not want to change TV and Internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Zibra, the European Commission would act in contravention of law if it exercised new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, would stop the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already suspended the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the Union fund to restore the economies affected by covid-19 pandemics.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the principles of the law.
“Poland should respond to this EU vision in all matters requiring unanimity,” said Ziobro, the head of the small party of Solidarity Poland, without whose vote the current government would come closely to the majority of the Seyma.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policies that lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will require Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be just because the EU unlawfully rejects us from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister.
His party's approach to the EU takes more radical attitudes than the ruler's Party of Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes in Polish justice for Ziobr's action threaten its independence and undermine politicians.
According to Zibrá, Brussels states "impossible conditions because its goal is not a state of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces “the political dictatorship carried out by visions and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles”, Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of a EU based on a partnership between sovereign states and not on the governments of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions of Brussels, which would result in a limited sovereignty of Poland.
“We will never agree to have Poland's status as colony,” he said.
Under the bridge someone killed an unconflict homeless man. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague Police, the murder occurred sometimes during the evening to the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, which is true at this time a police appeal for any testimony.
"Some of the drivers who passed through the bridge connecting Liben and Žižkov or on the street Pod Krejcarkem, for example, the enemy could shoot on board a camera.

"The most often moved in the vicinity of Krejcark, Palmovka and Holešovice, when he had large blue shopping bags," said Danek, a description of the victim who could also help any witnesses.

Magulena Bočanova interrupted the annual detox and again sins!
More than a year ago, Magulena Bočanova convinced Blesk that she climbed with alcohol. "On holidays, I said I would give my old crushed fifty-year-old body to inspire. I gave my time forever. I feel terrible to start, I have plenty of energy and especially improved my psychics. Recently, I was not mentally good to do so. Lip rises up, or my head, I have more energy, money."
"I sometimes give bubbles or quality wine, but they don't drink what ever before. I give one glass and enjoy until the morning. I have a bottle of wine for a week in the refrigerator. I also enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer that I can drink at any time," said Magulena, who still forms a couple with Brno entrepreneur Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after holidays and newly entered the series of the Ordination in the pink garden. "For the first two performances, I was really bad, I said, but it's better," a critical actress smiles.

And it's all about me.
Two years I follow how data is treated here as a fertilizer, most vaccination resistors are just a little more out of the bowl than most vaccinations.
Although rational discussions at the professional level take place, only extreme views are reached in the public space.
Continuously from the wall to the wall.
Binary consideration: vaccination saves us, vaccination is nothing.
Everything is prohibited, everything is allowed.
Color cakes instead of robust analyses.
Compare apples with pears.
This state has this and we have that.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states no one solves.
Oh, so I relieved.
Sorry for a fork and I wish you a nice day to all.
My childhood was punished by hobbies.
It was never because of stamps, most were just that I refused to hear and mislead (read instead of going to sleep, came with the bags, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without notice, my mother always threatened that if I do it once again, I will get the wound (sometimes even after another "start" hob only brought and laid it so that I can see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable implementation and measure) are beneficial because the child responds much more to them than to words.
It is important, according to me, that part of the warning because it gives the child its way to choose whether he will not hear and get, or will improve and the punishment will not.
Finally, I had only a warning to hear.
Former French President Chiraca burial on Monday, the public piet will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Paris cemetery Montparnasse, informing the French media with a appeal to the Chiraco family.
The public will be able to distinguish with the former head of state on Sunday afternoon during a piet in Paris, Disabled, where cancer will be exposed to the remains of Chirac, announced the Palace of Elizabeth.
President Emmanuel Macron announced a state sadness on Monday from Thursday evening, according to the AFP agency, to sign up to the Condolence Book.
Meanwhile, further reactions come from the world and from France to the deaths of the former Mayor of Paris and the President from 1995 to 2007, whose Prime Minister Ediard Philippe today referred to as "France in the right sense of the word".
For example, Chiraca reminded the Japanese, because the politician was known for his love for their country and sports sums. The report on the death of the former French president appeared on the title pages of all Japanese diary, including those of sports, notices the French press.
In honor of the former head of state, the Museum of stem art at the Paris Class of Quay Branly, which Chirac founded, will not choose ten days.
Selected system
When the important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtach Cepl answered the journalistic question, what the Czech Constitution meant for him – whether the sacred list, which she swears about, and which she reluctantly learned at school, or, on the contrary, the agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely adhered to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and to better save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
As the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, he voted the question of Vojtach Cepl.
However, recently, there is increasingly an opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to change.
Summer is tested by situations that her creators (which Vojtach Cepl belonged to) could not predict, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, the Ceple had the truth.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then it can be a key to tackling most of the crisis that companies meet across the history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a number of government regulations consisting of individual rules laying down the politicians of mantinels of the game.
We are afraid that much will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno I fight for the life of a monthly baby
Despite the fact that the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also difficult cases with which the hospitals are faced mainly recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected by less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, Primary Clinic of Children’s Anesthesiology and Resuscitation, Faculty of Medicine and Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children's patients who are severe with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need slight support care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Indeed, very severe children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were at the department according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"There is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, which means lung inflammation, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease interferes in addition to adults, both adolescents and several months' baby.
In hospitals, children are also in difficult condition due to coronavirus.
"Now we have a child of several months of adolescent age," said the primarily.
However, it is pleasant that no child deaths have yet been recorded at the children's hospital of FN Brno.
According to available data, six children between 0 and 14 years of age died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only at the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the collaboration of the psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults and in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the occurrence of postcovid syndrome.
“We recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children,” the doctor added.
The line D will find a new metro architect, brings experience from London underground
The Prague Transport Enterprise has chosen an architect who will supervise the form of the metropolitan subway. Since October, it will become Anna Švarc, its first task will be the appearance of a new line D, but the current station will also have the worst. On the subway, according to it, it is not only possible to look at the transport construction, travelling the subway should bring an aesthetic experience.
For example, the Czech architect, who participated in the reconstruction of three stations of London Metro, won the selection management written by the Prague Transport Enterprise (DPP).
Another 14 other applicants participated in the tendency. "The selection process included a motivational letter and a biography. Of course, my previous practice from London, where I created some aesthetic manual for the subway in the team of three people," the new metro architect was approaching, and according to her, she could also decide her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development.
Metro is not perceived only as a transport functional building. Stations should also have an aesthetic value.
"I am talking about how the subway will change, how the space will be improved, but how it will really take place, I will learn in the next weeks until my ideas will be covered by the transport undertaking," says Švarc.
"It is not a series of dogmats, but rather a recommendation aimed at maintaining the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," the design manual approaches.
Whether it is a similar tool and way to improve public space in the Prague Metro, there is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whether the manual is perfect, or whether it can roof some personality, I really don't yet know," concludes Švarc.
In a quiet zone you can walk only on the marked paths.
But the quiet zones are not so large.
You can see on map.
Generally in national parks outside the peaceful zone you can walk anywhere (but not through the fence to the field).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside the marked path must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so looking outside national parks).

Now the earth says a zero increase of the infected.
States, including the Czech opponents on Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors, have helped many in combating coronavirus, for example, at the top of Italy.

Is it a friendly support or a communist regime is trying to improve its image in the world?

List of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
"The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management is free of charge is direct. The financial houses count once they are refunded. When small migration between banks is likely not," says Kristina Kuncová from dTestu.
"Small accounts" according to it are able to almost all that accounts for adults. The child will receive his own payment card, can enter payments, track movements on the account, somewhere has his own electronic banking. Banks will establish an account, but it is on parents to learn how to treat them and also check their payment.
"A proportionately flexible parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and switch off individual services and so on. However, it can watch what is happening on the account, whether viewed via the Internet, or through information SMS. Attention, you no longer need to be free," adds Kuncova and adds: "If the parent considers the account for his child, he should consider his abilities and possibilities."

Double wrapped the hairdryer tape and drowned in the river, the bag found children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobyk. The seventy-year-old woman brought home a donated dog older than one to two years, whom she wanted to take care of, but her ten years older partner was not liked to be a hairdryer, so he decided to get rid of her.
"The animal wrapped the adhesive tape and accompanyed it and significantly eliminated its voice speech. He put the dog in the jute bag, which he lugged. Then the animal together took him to the river where they fit him in the bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into water, the dog proved to live," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplikova.

The fastest man of the planet missed tests. Nothing I don't guard
Thirty-nine-year-old Americans are the leader of the world's fastest men in the world championships, but he was threatened with missing doping tests.
The American Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) concluded its case at the beginning of September without charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not complete the three doping tests last year, but not within 12 months. His first guilty of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dated back to 1 April 2018, i.e. the beginning of the second quarter, but the test itself left until 6 June. And because the third forgotten occurred on 29 April 2019, Coleman failed to guilt in the form of three undoping controls within 12 months.
Coleman thought he had just forgotten to update the information in the app about places of residence of athletes. "I don't take drugs or don't take anything legal. Many athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't work hard and it's," he said before the start of the MS.
The only defeat of the sixth anniversary starts per hundred suffered immediately when he entered the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where only six thousand seconds was preceded by County Noah Liles, who used Coleman's absence to triumph in the final of the Diamond League, but only two hundred runs at the MS.
Paper’s second fastest racer is Nigerac Divine Oduduru, with a performance of 9.86 twenty-year-olds, but only in American university competitions.
The title will be defended by American Justin Hatlin, a seven-year-old American, who shined at 9.87 in June in Stanford. The last hundred in Zagreb runs only in 10.29 because he was slightly injured by the rear thigh muscle.
Akani Simbine, a three-fold Olympic medalist from Ria Andre de Grasse or Zharnel Hughes European champion, is the fastest Jamaican with Yogan Blake's 2011 World Championship.
The men's table begins on Friday before and runs. Seven finals and finals are on the program on Saturday. The medal will be held at 21:15 PM.
A friend meets a friend and tells him: gel don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The husband is happy because the salvation of grass, the car washs with a boot, the children play with him.
But a simple parade.
If you want to sell the elephant for 5000.
Camera: so yeah, yeah, it's gonna be a parade...
After some time they meet and what he bought complains: what are the will you sold for elephants????
The lawn breaks, everywhere the giant branch, the car settled, the children are afraid of him, and the wife wants to let him divorce.
Those who have sold said, Immortally speak of the elephant, you don't sell this elephant...
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The advantage of the children's clinics is built by an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanka Ledona Tony studied medicine in Czech and today only few people know that he is a foreigner.
In the Czech Republic, hundreds of doctors from abroad who could stay and work here, and some of them tried to obtain a pediatric clinic in Prague Motole.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive around five hours in the afternoon at the Motol Hospital in Prague, she had to arrive a lot. The Kurdish with shortly guarded hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, cities in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a child physician in the hospital and in the afternoon is still treated by small patients in private practice.
World events are controlled by high powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only happen if it works to integrate it.
So far, it works at the level of economic and political (in selected questions), but military integration is still missing.
I personally think Europe is directing towards federalisation.
It will not be 10, 15 or 20 years old.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, moods will be different and this will be done.

It also ignored me and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so maybe a Slovakian.
Only I am based on the fact that ellipse mostly includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas “Spanish fruits and mandarins” are no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I am based on the fact that the sentence sounds “all American forces”, including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are only operated by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in this broad term and it is not necessary to further specify for the US forces.
But again, you need only words :D
Whether it's so, or so, it's an unsensual requirement
A five-degree earthquake was recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's Tokyo metropolis and the surrounding areas hit 5.0 degrees of earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said that buildings had been hungry in the capital, but no damage had yet been reported.
No warning was issued or warned before the tsunami, Reuters informed.
Vicky Holland from Britain tortured the cap of cosman Milly
The decisive photographs show the moment when the sweetened monkey was crying in the toilet mission before her sensitive owner was flushing and hanging her.
Dutch monkey also feededed parks, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The magistrate court in Gwent now banned her lively animal breeding, informed The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of opices who care for Milly after her tyranny declared that such an excited space had never seen.
Milly spent nearly two years of rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset and now plays again with another saving monkey name Moon.
Four times the mother was admitted to two accused of unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the magistrate court in Gwent, she was imposed a twelve-year sentence of imprisonment with a suspended delay for one year.
Dutch was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-life ban on animal breeding and must pay at a cost of CZK 12,000.
Steph Sawier's leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the tyranny animal, said, "Milly is okay, but rehabilitation will continue."
Milli lasted before she was accustomed to people.
She cried and hid himself in front of everyone who met and any loud sound or sudden movement he shouted her.
She refused to eat her for a long time.
Even now, when she settled and satisfied with a male, her view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from tyranny will be accompanied forever, Sawier adds.
Tyranny Milly appeared after the police in Hwent discovered a horrible shot in a woman's phone after a shock in her apartment due to drug charges.
On the shots you can hear how Milly gives vulgar.
On another video it is to hear how Holland's monkey offers a cocaine and says, "Do you want a cocaine?"
So I'll get my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russel Cox (43) admitted to holding a cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (at least 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from this revision three times after you staticly cross the entire 20th century?
How do you take the same things as in the sixth class?
And all this kills the idea of bifling, when no one, honour excludes, won't know if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test on 1 and then it does not interest anyone.
Running and on the street random people ask if you can determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone has gone through, and the absolute majority will not scratch and tell you that they have absolutely in their teaching.
So what does it learn about?
I am a great fund of a general overview and the fact is that people don't want and have no need.
And at that moment it's unnecessary and you'll never get it equally to them.
This is partly learned for a lot of people who will need this thing.
But like, the note that on the walls of the machine you don't need it all, I thought absolutely seriously...... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we get slowly until you know the stamp of the punch.

Wedding at first glance: War of Kadri and Andrei continues!
What is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea replied to the instagram in Stories to all questions of raising fans, what she disappointed on Kadri so that she decided to terminate all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrei, it has been violined since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, i.e. at least until he returned to Bohemia.
But she refused to do so.
And as it can be seen, their relationship not only ended with love, but rather grew into mutual respect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he started turning Kadra in response to Andreino's charges of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri now has not liked his younger sister Linde.
She decided to detain her brother publicly.
Normally, these things are not expressed at all and we never said too much extra in the family.
I don't want to definitely cause some regret.
But when I see someone trying to hurt publicly and dirty the name of someone I like so much, it just doesn't give me!
I am sorry that I have to do this, but I would like to thank my brother Kadri for having done his own character and helping our family when we needed it even the youngest age.
It's more fraudulent to me when I have to read such false information that is probably quite disappeared from the context.
I would all like to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and the family, is in recognition in response to the words of Andrei.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him all over and know the reality and know how it was actually added uncertainly.

You don't believe what.
Cchao started his ski trip at the parking lot in the residential neighbourhood, where he tried to enter several cars.
According to the available information, the vehicle finally departed at least 330 crowns.
Then he thought nothing better than climbing on the 5th floor and climbing the open window into the apartment.
There were two bananas stolen.
On the shot from one security camera, it is then captured how to leave the street away from the place of action and at the same time rides the banana.
When the owner of the apartment wake up in the morning, he found that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
Then Cchaaa detained.
A man admitted that on an incriminated day he drank something alcohol.
And because he needed money, he decided to lie in despair.

Epilepsy complicated him with love for sport, thanks to the operation has a new hope
For the first time, Gonzik's parents noted that there was nothing in order with him, in a year and half. He always looked into the space for a few minutes, destroyed and did not respond to anyone. Therefore, a child's doctor sent him to a children's neurological clinic, where physicians after a series of examinations set him a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately set her medications, but did not work immediately.
Almost a year lasted before doctors found the perfect combination of medicines, thanks to which they completely stopped taking captures. In five years, doctors planted medicines, and because the captures were not returned, parents thought they were healthy and began to lead him more to sports. Riding on the bike, skiing, playing tennis and florbal, leisure time spent grams with their sisters and friends. At the age of eleven, they got another capture and everything began again.
Doctors again tried various combinations of medicines, but this time nothing was taken, the seizures in the form of absence were constantly repeated. Since the seizure of Gonza always stopped perception, parents suffered from getting it in sports and wounding. Gradually, Gonza stopped riding on bikes and skis were exchanged for cross-country skis and snowboards. Although from time to time sports caused seizure, he never gave himself completely. Even fulfilled the dream and reached the Spartan Race racing, but together with a friend who had constantly on his eyes to help him in the event of an emergency.
When Gonza was 15 years old, parents decided to try to change the doctors and turned to experts at the FN in Motola. There, after a series of examinations, doctors found that Gonza is a candidate for surgical treatment, which will remove the bearing from the brain - a source of epileptic seizures. "I had 2 surgeries behind myself, first my doctors in the brain operated probes, which were captured by his activities, then I could remove the bearing. It was a few days hell for me. I had to lie only and almost not move, from my head I had wires that were connected to the computer," Gonza reminds.
"The first days after the surgery it was quite mental, Gonza was apathic, confused, sad and almost not talking. Unlike normally living and communicative, it was a terrible change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," describes Mom and adds: "The month and half after the surgery had 1 capture, but according to doctors, it becomes. Since then it has been 3 months without capture."
This year's school year, Gonza will be mature, in addition to sports he enjoys languages and began to cooperate with Society E, which goes after schools to talk about epilepsy. The sports activities Gonza don't fit full yet, he begins to return gradually to sports. "I learn how to sport properly, how to breathe well so that the body doesn't expose sudden stress, but with my competitive nature quite nuts," explains Gonza.
This year, therefore, the traditional EPPI water triathlon will not participate actively in this year, which will meet patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes and which will take place this weekend on 28 September 2019 in Veselské sandy. But the next year is probably yes.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilist or foreign politician?
I think this is all that people write here you know well.
Just play on the fool to be with whom to "think".
If not, it's sad.
I don't claim that Christians are degenerates or nothing such.
Even I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic perspective (which eventually was the goal to look good).
And I'm quite one who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am defective in how much church had too much money in the Middle Ages, how much money was recorded, suppressed science, etc.
Don't talk about all wars that caused, for example, the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetto monster, but the state and church do not have anything to do together

The link to both games is on the Epic Store here. You can enter the games in your library and directly via the web, but you need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play.
The Redux Metro 2033 is edited by the 2010 version of the original game, adds graphical and playable changes to the continuation of Last Light.
The story on the motifs of the same name of the book Dmitry Glukhovsky takes place in 2033 in Russia after the nuclear war. The ground surface as we know no longer exists. Mankind had to move under the ground, in our case to extensive complexes of Moscow subway.
"To take the post-apocalyptic world and the empty atmosphere from an unknown environment, take away to the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action passages and traditions: Metro 2033 is worldwide," we wrote on Bonusweb in a time review.
Everithing is, on the contrary, a relaxing game-negro in a procedurally generated world that carries messages from an English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. The player can become anything, from animals to trees to the planet.

The French cook is sitting with Michael due to the removal of the star. Threat depression, hard
The famous French chef Marc Veirat arrived this January at the third Michelin Star, a year after acquiring it. With the publisher of the red guide, he intends to judge to receive exact reasons for degradation. Veirat also doubts about the competences of Michelin inspectors who according to him have confused the saffron with the cheer. The first judicial overlap will take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Horní Savojsko came in January this year by one of the three Michelin stars. With the publisher of the prestigious guide Le Guide Michelin will judge because the Commissioners' conclusion according to him was not properly substantiated. In addition, the star took place without notice. "Six months I suffer from depression. How do you consider playing with healthy cooks?" said Veirat Commissioners.
Michelin provided only important reasons for the cooking, such as that the chef gave the chef to the suffle cheer, which did not like the inspection. "I gave him a cheerleader and those gentlemen thought it was a cheerleader, because it was yellow. From the beginning with love, I worked with Sawanese ingredients," said Veirat. This is a conviction of the strong incompetence of Michelin Commissioners: "You are fraudulents who just cause disputes for commercial reasons." The wrapped cheerleader does not understand "how they could afford to say that we gave our cheerleader to our suffle." "They have hit the team and our region, my employees were
A distinctive cook, always with a black hat on the head and dark glasses, is a resistance to the new generation of Michelin Commissioners, and therefore requests the withdrawal of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do so. "If the company remains open and our inspectors will re-elect it, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Pillennec, International Director of Michelin.
According to Michelín, the chef's claim that he has no meaningful accusations yet, and the lawyer will only help him to formulate it. "We are flying that Mr. Veirat is communicating roughly with us, but we are carefully exploring his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two more three-star restaurants.
The man fell down from twelve metres.
Now the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, with rescuers of the Regional Health Rescue Service.
Employees of the Regional Operational Centre took an hour after Saturday midnight emergency call with the first information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two crews of ZZS - medical and medical.
After arrival in the place of healthcare, they found that a seventeen-year-old man had to fall from the window from about twelve meters high and impact his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice the coal caught.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went to the event.
At the time of arrival of rescue services teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and a direct threat to life.
The intervening doctor invented his breathing path, provided artificial lung ventilation and, after further measures in the framework of pre-National urgent care, transported him a sanitary vehicle to the next care of the Ostrava Traumatological Centre, informed the spokesperson for the MSZ of the Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have greater concerns than coronavirus from inadequate public and government responses

Germany reports the first case of infections by the Westonil burner from the mosquito in its territory. This is related to climate change
Mosquitoes other than the Westonyl fever can also be transmitted, for example, malaria.
On Friday, Germany announced the first case when a person was infected with a Westonil fever in the German territory after a mosquito infected mosquito, informing the DPA agency. Until now, all patients have infected virus in travelling or contacting sick animals. According to experts, the breakdown case is related to climate change.
Robert Koch stated that the virus was infected by a seventy-year-old man from Saxony. The disease had a serious course and was treated in the hospital in Lipsk due to brain inflammation. Now it is healthy.
The Westonil fever virus was proven for the first time in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it expanded to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe and in the 1990s to the United States, mainly birds and mosquitoes that infect their blood.
Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things are divided.
Julianna Penová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amandu Nunes, who did not find a winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, showed great scratches against Dustinu Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kay Kara-France, who quickly destroyed Cody Harbrandt by the technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one waited.
This brought women's bantama scales between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Pen.
The Americans entered the mutual battle as a thoughtful “throat”, for Nunes did not lose seven years and grinded her teeth to another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the path behind the victory a lot actively and the opponent even sent push kick to the ground.
However, foam was not forced to have any other mistake, and she tried to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was cutting and for MMA fans very tensile.
Both opponents participated in a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes got on the ground, where she began to cut her.
She had to try to give up and attack off.
The Americans thus prepared a huge shock when he became a new champion.
The top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was better managed, but the card began to turn.
In that second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to overcome the levers on his hand.
He didn't manage too much, but then he created great pressure, got the opponent on his back and hit him a number of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked hockey, to which Poirier had been resisting for a while, but then he had to scatter.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, for two years.
In the next match, he wrote a sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who had already settled on Raulian Paiv in the first round hard right back.
He then won a number of precisely measured strikes and recorded fifteen triumphs.
Kara-France then managed to consult Cody Harbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now she lost for seven years.
Did he dig or dig you?
At first glance, nothing is difficult.
Most of the substantial names in Czech are expressed only by one grammatical family, and therefore there is no problem with them to determine whether it is a male, female or medium family.
Then there is also a relatively numerous group of substantial names in which the family is not fixed.
Such substantial names fluctuate between two families.
When inclining, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “sweesel” or “sweesel” are both male and female, in the first place they inclined according to the model “sweeper”, in the second according to the model “songs”.
For other groups of substantive names, different shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, for example: row/row, cylinder/club or cylinder/potatoes (in the sense of food).
Both faces are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely substitutable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, such as "cucucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian version is unwritten, similar to other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "cumber" and "cumber", "cumber" and "cumber" etc.
Some words that penetrated Czech from other languages were originally inclined, but gradually accept Czech endings.
A typical example is the word “image”, which is a male and female family, or the word “buffet”, which remained in the middle family inclined, but has endings according to the pattern “hall”.
Civilization in time-connected
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "smooth" from one of the great stories of Shimka and Grossmann, partially playing on the cemetery, which sounds as follows: "I noticed that it breaks well, but on a foreign grave!" she said to me that many world politicians are now behaving in an unconscious struggle against climate change.
They behave as if people were led to the planet Earth. In fact, we are only a wash on its surface, which it can with its volunteer forces fit as a sharp winding of the flame of candles. Some of them are looking at famous British and American nature documents dealing with the destruction capabilities of our blue balls. It would always be enough for some of the larger active sopes to properly "upshike" and our advanced civilizations to replicate this.
In the near future, it is highly likely that a number of large volcanoes have, according to the opinion of leading volcanoists, "charged and cleaned" (e.g. Katla on Iceland).
Its way would be ideal if the eruption, if one should happen, occurred as soon as possible, before the totally unnecessary elimination of billions of dollars to measures aimed at reducing the production of carbon oxygen, because any properly broken volcano, along with dust and poisonous sophisticated gases, can release at least one hundred times more than the expense of Europeans.
Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that, with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants are more biological material and are also more dry resistant to humanity, possibly warming is substantially more favourable than for example, a rapid return of ice.
If we realize this still insufficiently exploring the effects of sun cycles on the Earth's climate, we must only reach a single reasonable conclusion: We are trying to keep the Earth as clean as possible and other changes as we can't deal with, we are trying to adapt as little as possible!

Turkey opened a journey for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look right on the Greek borders?
The Greek-Turkish border has tensions due to the growing number of migrants who are trying to reach Europe further.
Thousands of people began publishing to the southern border of Schengen after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece support, and the Czech Government is also undertaking humanitarian assistance.
What actually motivates refugees to the uncertain path?
And what does the situation look right on the spot?
Renewable sources will not cover increased demand, says the European ExxonMobil chief
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to satisfy future energy demand, due to the inappropriate climate, wind and solar power plants will need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with GN, Philippe Ducom, President of the European ExxonMobil Group, is one of the largest global oil heaters. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, which would later be saved by unconsumed energy from days when the sun and wind are enough, are still too expensive.
Ducom in Prague visited ExxonMobil, where 1200 people work and whose task is to support business activities of the company and provide logistics and other services needed for the operation of the company.
Three months we didn't see blue heaven and we thought, a journalist from Sydney describes
The destructive fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and disappeared millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves cope with disasters?
Can the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent drastic impacts, how hard critics?
And what countries will need to prepare for the future for climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalists from Sydney Iki Detřich.
False accusations were always and are quite rare.
Therefore, everyone is always written completely everywhere.
For people, it is unpleasant to solve both sexual violence in our society and both terrible expansion and try to order it.
I don't know personally anyone who was falsely charged.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and experienced how people often behave about their surroundings or police.
Victims should always believe.
The trend was that victims finally open up their trauma.
But it still leaves too much people for themselves.
Yes, even those who falsely accuse someone will find.
It is a angry and facial victim of sexual violence, but by disseminating the idea that "a large part of the accusations is thought" and that it is "trend" you only help sexual violence.
The soldiers train, download curtains. China is going to celebrate the Massacre site
The parade army trained in recent weekends. Shops in the centre of Beijing had to close, and the inhabitants near the square were designed to tighten curtains. After empty streets, military vehicles rolled over to the square and crossed fighting aircraft on the sky.
Several Chinans told Reuters that they were proud to expose their countries to their military force, but one woman told that it was difficult to deny that other states would celebrate disappointment.

The Southern port of Sia-men has shown a special light show on Thursday night. Sia-men lies opposite Taiwan Island and belongs to the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, a list of prohibited things is growing, which is already on it drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, broadcasters and devices using radio waves, the Guardian newspaper added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo erases "threatening political information".
"It is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (in the spring) despite all predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who deals with China. "It is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, when communists led by Mao Ce-tung won in the struggle with Chankajshki nationalists who rose to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a catastrophic communist experiment in the form of a so-called cultural revolution. In June 1989, the regime at the Square of Heavenly Quiet Tank ointmented thousands of pro-democratic demonstrators from a number of students and workers.

Czech Republic floods flooded houses, families do not have money to finish
Prices of construction material increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have reached the wedding situation.
There is no means to complete disposed of households and banks refuse to increase mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already disposed of family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
In a better case, people move to disassembled and uncollaborated houses.
In the worse case, uninhabited houses are uninhabited, and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgage and to pay for it even rental," says economist Štěpán Kreček.
We will build two to three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them have happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even if the material irritated.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivon.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the building of the house to go for five million, now it will become seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivon.
The material was most affected by honey, iron, as well as installation and topping equipment.
However, construction companies also fight labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of structural fields and the influx of foreign workers brake the pandemic.
At this moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of construction permits is beneficial.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're going to be good and we'll be still better.
But actual vision is missing, says ČRO commentator – mujRozglas

The taxpayer has been planning the Ministry since 2021. The taxpayer does not change
The MF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive food directly, so that the MF and quarter of employees can support food, i.e. about a million people who still do not receive food.
According to the President of the David Rice Association of Voucher Operators of Voucher Systems, however, a number of small companies that do not have cantin or diets, their employees provide food, for example, by importing food or dealing with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything at the tax discount. Furthermore, it will not be paid for health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the boundaries for the maximum employer's contribution would remain applicable as a tax discount.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the diet. The remaining part of the add-on employees, in some cases the employer is paid, but without a tax discount. The most advantageous value of the diet for employees and employers is CZK 123 this year.
As in this, my diploma comes super right, I have my own theme I have chosen, follow the bachelor, I always do it all year round, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The villages are completely quiet, if a person is not a total poppy and something remains in his head, so he will not unnecessarily throw him on the theory.
I must have learned a week at the state station and when I was at the end, so my commission always tried to bring to some logical derivation that I was accompanied and I had the right thing.
Otherwise to those projects, I know people who pay someone to make them the semester project (we have done it a lot of times, really beneficial, a lot of learning) and then only learn the project and have to be obsolete.
According to me, it is super when at the end of the course there is an examination to which knowledge obtained within the project is demonstrated, not only defence.
Autoladička brought a voice of a digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, voices of a long text that Michael Hobbes wrote for Huffington Post and photographed Finlay Mackay. In a provocative explanation, he writes that the medical community ignored the facts of obesity for decades and led an unnecessary (as well as unnecessary) war against people with overweight, who not only noted public opinion, but also destroyed a lot of lives, but now is time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes points out at the beginning is the fact that from the leadership and knowledge of facts to the introduction into practice, the British Navy often leads a very long and tired path. However, the case of curds, when some captains have been distributing their crews lemons, lime and oranges with the faith that will prevent such illnesses. However, the British Navy has withdrawn from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear effect of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the field of the 18th century, but lasted another fifty years before the naval took into account. Even safety belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they began to be invented in the 1960s, as well as the first confirmed death
"Every public health discovery - and no matter how important - had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the company to be implemented," writes Hobbes. Today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than breast cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinson and HIV together.
Obesity is regarded as a highly personal failure of an individual who claims to be burdened by health care and reduces GDP. Fear of thickness is so large in the population that the Americans today spend more money on diets than how much they spend on computer games and films. However, the truth is that diets do not work. Already in 1959 research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight ends with failure and two thirds of people will then take more on diet than they agreed.
Armed by statisticians Hobbes also describes the lifestyle and trauma of people with overweight. Personally, there is a systematic meeting, when the faculty in the teaching of future doctors deals with the issue of nutrition of only 19 hours from the entire study. As at the time when 60 calories process that Americans accept come from ultra-processed food - that is, too processed food.
As obesity is stigmatized, I illustrate news from the order, where people with overweight usually experience shorter tours, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
However, the overweight is not only the American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, the share of obesity in 73 countries of the world has doubled and increased in 113, and during that time no country has managed to reduce and stop this growth.

Statement by Donbas Workers
The union – yes, broken – no, express their opinion on the image by the opponents of the breakdown of the USSR.
Thirty years since the unlawful breakdown of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster took place in the history of humanity.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Elcin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šuškevich, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open conciliating attitude of Michael S. Horbach, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “The Union of the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality stops existing”.
One thing of the feathers "cancelled" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the disintegration of the USSR, dozens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were found abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Even before, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years in one seat in the Belovéžské forest betrayed the socialist camp (creating the prize of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously deindustrialized, contaminated agriculture, rejected the world's largest power of fourteen republics, which had previously been economically linked to a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the deterioration of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, army, the growth of criminality, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of a geopolitical chapter, the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in politics as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been destroyed and devoted to ruin was quickly filled in and conquered by NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical chapter.
And the whole world is so far cut mainly due to events from the end of the eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident to D5: The motorway closed the rainfall of fireplaces
The event was reported around 08:00 to 22 kilometers in the direction of Prague. "The dance is closed, at least for freight transport. Personal cars can go through gasoline," said police spokesperson Michaela Richterová. The operation managed to restore around 14:30. The preliminary damage is, according to Richter, at least two million crowns, the cause of an accident is investigated by police officers.
The spokesperson for Central Bohemian firefighters Petr Svoboda said that one stone transported passenger vehicles and the other plastic granulate. "Despite the great impact, transported vehicles were shifted, which firefighters had to first ensure against any fall," he added.
One of the cars was damaged by a fuel tank from which about 200 litres of diesel escaped. Another 200 litres of firefighters managed to exhaust. The accident was occupied by environmental workers of the Berin Town Hall. The dismantling of emergency vehicles and the passing of the motorway was provided by a private company that extracted and contaminated the ground.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket worth 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with I put it in the refrigerator and make it on Thursday evening.
In an alternative reality in which I don't buy meat on Monday, it will be discounted to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - will you describe my mechanism, which of this meat will change its price to be an attraction for my digestive system?
And or wait to quarter and this meat will be discounted 1 day before the consumption date to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK on the road and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I will send myself - nothing.
These are the things that when something is cheap, so it must be guaranteed bad, disproportionate or unquality you are terriblely retarded to tell you the truth;-)
The Germans chose to head the Keller Football Union
The new president of the German Football Union was expected to be the current chief of the Freiburg Bundeslig Fritz Keller. The winner, gastronomer and hoteler were elected unanimously for three years, and he had no candidate.
Keller replaced Reingard Grindel, who left in April due to unrecognised revenues, and his other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go before the court because of the possible payment for the World Championships in 2006.
Keller said that one of the main goals will return a trust union and bring it out of the crisis. "It will not be any One Man Show, many people will be responsible. The union is better than his reputation," Keller said, who presented all his tasks under the password: Together we can do it.
After electing to Keller's leadership, he left the function in Freiburg.
Children's zoo is pleased with a small poppy
"Our fat reads seven members at present. Her youngest member came to the world on August 17, bore him Buffy and her fifth young man, her father is Gitam. The first days after her birth she was wearing young people firmly pressed to the body and did not want to show the world if she was born a male or a female for a long time. At about three weeks of age, the younger began to postpone him gradually for a small moment, and the nursers know that this is a female for a few days," said Alena Hyšková, speaker of the zoo that the zoo of Děčín successfully left 12 younger of this kind.
Makak's chocolates are the so-called endemites of the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live elsewhere in the world in free nature. A typical character is black coat and chocolate on the head, according to which they have a name. Makak's chocolates live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Living like most primato plant and animal food, the dining room prevails of very significant fruits of forest trees, which complement flowers and leaves. The need for protein is solved by insurance of small members, larives and to a lesser extent bird eggs and younger.
"If we remember the natural enemies that are scratched, all the others wrote on their robe again a man. Locals hunting macaki as a favorite benefit with tasty meat and fur. It is fate for these animals and burning and swallowing rainforests," the speaker added.

Prerov: The driver crashed in the village of Kokori: The spell died in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight line between Přerov and Kokori. The 28-year-old fabie choser did not manage to control and exit outside the road. The car turned into a roof and remained spelled under it. The injury suffered.
"According to the initial information found on the site, a passenger vehicle edited in the direction of Kokora outside the communication, where it turned into a roof and the driver remained spelled under the vehicle," said the huge police spokesperson Milus Zajicová for the news server.cz.
Now I recently went to Heads in Brno and in the approach of dairy distributed some brochure, like things I always take to help brigades, they can't get it...
Well, the brochure was full of rural intelligence and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I found it to be a kind of agitation.
After reading, I found who issued it and finally came out of it scientology.
Well, like a good mattress, full of completely unnecessary picks, as I have to be taught and not learned.
A bad paper, because of this, the forests would not have to go.
I experienced something similar to the former girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional visualism force you to comply with this person because you like it without realizing how much it is in the p*deli situation.
Sometimes I was threatened with hurt because of this I went with a friend who was not happy to move out.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, I was asked to go on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year, it was a super relationship, but then it took another half a year and started to crash it on the stick.
Then I ended my relationship with it, and I told her to break out, but I can talk about it next week to calm it, and not to catch some amoke.
Such a person hangs your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
More preferably hold the distance
When the insurance companies are scratched by purchasing the cloud of tests and going to positive ones who would not be a test or know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers and others because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of domestic imprisonment.
In the west they ceased with the chashkers and recognised that they had no price to solve the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something else and drive its thoughtful busting.
I'm looking back to the old good scar.
After several years of refusal and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruitment returns to the sun.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (which was 20 years old, the element at the university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly turned into "that may not be interested, especially people's seizure".
I was sincerely interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, however, the trainings were rather about how to scare and leak people.
When the first earned money came, man quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he must navigate several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgage were the only earnings, or then a man felt as a ground seller of pots.
But what I can say, the experience was valuable, a person learned that he should not jump right on every top and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't all go into one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not be praised by expensive consumer goods or "fat" content.
Milan Jakubo: The burial of the army stole for herself! Rika Andor Šandor
At the burial of Brigadier General Milan Jakubo, they still have unclearness. The media speculated in the week that the army of the last resolution with the Deputy Director of the Military Intelligence planned despite the wishes of the family bombatic, as only soldiers can. The inequalities also ruled about the date of the burial.
"It's not a sense! With the family we have been in contact since the beginning of the negotiated Friday burial term, no one changed it. Just like military honours, we will only solve the possible participation of the media in the family," said Pejšek in the middle of Blesk. The funeral will eventually take place on Friday and will not miss any military honours, including the crossing of irons.
The last resolution with the favorite general, however, has a tense atmosphere, because the sad ceremony will not take part in the decision of the organizers who have worked with the general in the past!
For example, it is a former chief of military intelligence Andor Šandor (62), who met Milan Jakubo 17 years ago. Shandor remembers former colleague as a working, intelligent and "good boy".
In addition, it has been regularly met with him in recent years at the celebrations of the anniversary of the establishment of the Military Report, which is why I would like to distinguish with Milan Jakubo. "I would personally be on the funeral of Milan Jakubo el," said Blesk Šandor.
"I also know about other people from an organisation who would like to eat, but they have resin because they hurried themselves with potential funerals. I think this is not the right to privatize the funeral," said the security expert. He doesn't even have an allegedly considered closure of the ceremony for the public because of the secret army leaders.
"The deployment of the army is not hidden, and the leaders of the military report also not, because they need to be raised at the Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media are truthful and the family actually left behind the army, of course, this is the matter of the family. I would personally never allow the army to prevail the family and its wishes," concluded Šandor.
Milan Jakubo died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlín during a car accident. The front clash of Milan Rapid with Ford Mustang allegedly caused the driver of the sportsman Vojtach Ch. (31).
The amateur racer in the corner was sent to the opposite direction, Milan Jakubo apparently did not have a chance to prevent the conflict. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries during the accident and it is possible that the consequences will be brought to the end of life. The police heard out of accident on Thursday.
Czechs or children are forgotten to enter. ČOI revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misappropriation of prices and non-compliance with sales fairness principles.
In one case, discrimination rejects the restaurant in Prague to go to the business of smaller children. On its website, according to ČOI, the equipment is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "On an electronic question to the consumer whether it is possible to order a table for four adults in the restaurant and one child under the age of four, the employee of the restaurant replied electronically that the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant is not accepted," Fröglich added.
"Czech speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit to the table in the restaurant and make an order. English speaking consumers were allowed to do so," the spokesperson described.
Both cases are now solved in administrative proceedings, because they are not yet terminated, the spokesperson's inspection could not communicate more information to the restaurants mentioned.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small part of the restaurants controlled in the second quarter. A total of 139 inspections were carried out by ČOI. In addition to the two cases mentioned, discrimination revealed different doubts in 64 cases, most of which were deficiencies in respect of the principles of fairness of sales and non-information of consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already in the center of the inspection she informed about cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffe and Cafe Restaurant. In both offices, foreigners were charged more than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, 60,000 CZK have already fallen competently.
In the corporate where I did not experience much such things.
HR is quiet, managers look at their management and they don’t squeeze us much into anything.
Regular evaluation is now somehow happening in the form of what is happening to us quite (see some goals for the next year, we look at what happened in a year and what is not) - it is rather self-evaluation than evaluating someone according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also not required.
But we are a little escaped in our company - they are separated from what are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels that we are a short startup that scoots in the offices of a large corporate no.
But this works so I don't poison us much until the results are.

In four municipalities, new representatives were allocated by the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, in the villages of Komna in Hungary, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovna in Pelgrimovsko elected a new representative office.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law or the number of representatives elected here has fallen.
There were 99 candidates in the new elections for 28 mandates.
Electoral participation reached 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovna, where 93.62 % of the voters were elected.
A total of 8 women and 20 men gained the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for new elections to representatives in the four municipalities.
There were 28 representatives of 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidacy was 46.6 years old.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday elections for us symbolicly closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to general representatives and, above all, very observed elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in the more challenging epidemic conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpova, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistics Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and post-approval will be published in the Laws Collection.
Whether fans are positive, I wish Hašek. Spartu is waiting for a slut in Pilsen
"We will play at the boundaries of possibilities, we will do everything that will be in our power to succeed, so that the matches are playable and effective," promised spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for club TV.
In the week he decided to a cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta went to the next round, which was a duty for her. She relied on her, but the game went on to suffer.
Although the season slowly turned to the second third, the football Sparta is still looking for the shape of which coach Václav Jilek spoke about the edges of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, who has very high quality players, waiting for us a complex match," warns Pilsen Roman Prochazka.
When the spartans arrived at the Schruncové sady last, in mid-May, this was a clear matter in the superstructure. Guests left after the airless performance with 0:4, the biggest in the history of a separate Czech league.
While there was a difference between clubs in the table of eight-points before each other, Sparta is now losing ten matches of the new season for nine points, one of the worst entrances to the season at all.
"It's not a simple situation even for us, nor for fans who would like to see their beloved club completely elsewhere," says Hašek. "But we would like to continue to support us, remain positive and become behind us."
Sparta does not know if in Pilsen he will be able to use Tettega, who was excluded in Pilsen, but appealed against him on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panak, Pulkrab, Zagustel, Krejčí and Kalec remain on numerous marodes, who, as one of the staff, remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
As a captain, the defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan refuge, should gather homemade, including the middle cup in Glucin, in the last five matches.
The library remembers the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV of the manuscript exhibition
Six rare historic manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can now and on Saturday watch people in the Prague Clementin. The National Library released them from its safeguards to remember the 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. Today morning libraries and restorers placed rare originals in the Window in the Mirror Chapel. Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge, opened for both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
Exhibition of lists named Ad mandate domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV prepared a library together with the National Archive. On the written heritage of the government of Wenceslas IV, the National Archives of theatre from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, the author Jan Vojtišek said to the exhibition.
"The visitors can look forward, for example, to the work on the agriculture of Petr de Crescentiis, which is essentially some encyclopedia of agriculture, or to the breviar, i.e. the prayer book of one of the Benedictines of the monastery of St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he named the reasons why people should see the exhibition according to him.
The Epistels of Petro of Blois will also be exhibited, where the original miniature G (enrico) depicts the half figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely to be the Master of Samson History, who, next to the two volumes of the Bible Wenceslas IV, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin compilation of tractats John Wicliff from about 1411 to 1414.
The library did not preserve one book on the Czech territory, according to experts in the largest and most beautiful book collections in the Central Europe at that time, because the young king was seeking to build a representative library that would be balanced with book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Wenceslas' death. According to all, it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle of Hussites, but several codes were saved. Their own Austrian national library today.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public alive and not only in the form of a digital library Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, Director of the National Library.
On the day of the Saturday State holiday, a free exhibition entitled What is hidden under the floor will be opened in Clementin, which presents archaeological discoveries here.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a totally dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning of the moment, but it went without more irritation.
To cope with how much of the population on all their layers becomes idiotic, I have a problem so far.
I am most looking forward to vaccination ( tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally depend on the fact that other people are not beaten.
He would be deprived of the presidency and the ability to recruit it.
The chance that this really happens is, but as others mention a lot small here.
Moreover, I am not sure if the writing of the writing would at all be considered a railroad.
The Iron Council is an act that threatens the President of the Republic to sovereignty, territorial integrity or the democratic nature of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How pandemic affected intimate life: Increased number of people under 35 years old who are without sex all year round
The more young adults in the USA live their lives without sex.
It is mainly religiously based people, says the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who appear to have raised from eight to 21 per cent.
A woman between 18 and 35 years of age, who said they had no sexual intercourse in the last year, is more than ever before.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed the research of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them can be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less prioritized for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35, who state that they did not have sex in the previous year," said IFS Liman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been sex-free in the past year.
Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of pre-marriage and religious foundation is also contributed to the loss of sexual activity.
Although it is more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and committed under 35 years of age is still declining.
Young people divide the view on pre-marriage sex, about 30% of it has a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that there are minorities among free individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts this trend," says Stone about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage relations, the reason for religious foundation is.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60% for free people under 35 years of age, who participate in religious meetings more than once a month.
Between "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," said Stone.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interactions and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason can be the expansion of digital media that apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replace” this need.
This trend was mainly caught behind lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. Exploration did not confirm it
"It is therefore shown that young Czechs have somewhat greater trust in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents had a significantly greater proportion of poor answers," said CRUK director Jaroslava Palendalova.
Instead, men and young secondary schools believe their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn about the functioning of financial matters most of the parents (37 per cent), self-study on the Internet (23 per cent) and up to the third row of school education (21 per cent).
Questions around funding are consulted primarily by women, while information on the Internet is rather searched for by men. The obtaining of information about funding from parents is predominant in all age categories of young people, regardless of their achieved education or personal income. Practically, the prospects of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have minimal influence.
"Again, the importance of raising children of their parents, who represent authority in all the main areas of life, is therefore a key level of financial literacy for parents who transmit their knowledge and experience to their descendants," Palendalova said.
Savings and investments prefer 94 percent of young people.
Youth clearly ask whether it is better to save and get your own house or apartment, or enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and own housing.
The strategy of savings and investment in long-term material assets is recognized by 94 per cent of the respondents, including all age categories of young people, regardless of their education, social status or current amount of personal income.
The investigative strategies stop people in marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector, on the contrary, rather people living alone and receiving over 30,000 CZK per month.
The entire vaccination against covid is whether society should force part of the population to behave, which they do not want, but which can save them life.
It is a relatively difficult question on which my personally most interested question of social conscience.
For example, the question whether if we do not rule them and they will die, it will be our wines.
My argument is that we could definitely die for the death of an eighty-year-old man who actually did not know much, we did not explain it well to him, heard some disinformation, and, as a result, did not vaccinate and eventually caught and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a confirmed vaccination vaccination resistance, which, on the side of the SPD and the CNR, takes something about the chic and totalitarian state.
Of the statistics I mentioned, it can be clearly imported that most of the unavailable pensioners are most likely to be part of the second group, so they will really be able to do so.
Brno Great Price? Ticket Ticket Ticket Ticket Ticket Ticket Ticket
The most expensive item is every year before the Grand Prix list fee. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who arrive at the Grand Prix will spend money there for accommodation, food or entertainment, which should be more or less balanced with the cost of organizing the event including the list fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the race is also important in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno has not so much world tourist attractions. The great price attracts visitors from abroad. It is important for Brno as well as Turkish airports or exhibition centers. And these are projects that are supported from public money," the economist added.
Large price in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the last five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for organisation, increased list fee for Dorna Promotional Company
- possible solution: more money from the state, use of advertising area, increase in ticket price
- current status: negotiation of a new contract to organize races for the next five years
According to the Director of the Institute of Public Administration, Philip Grozi, organizers must now evaluate whether the race is beneficial for Brno. "Grand Prix sends money from public budgets to other matters, but to some extent it is political, not economic," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorist event can be even higher, because in the game there is an option to increase the leaves fee almost twice.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst scenarios were fulfilled, I am afraid that it is not real that the city and the region pay the amount," said Brno Mayor Marketa Vanková.
As Deník Equality has already informed, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also talking about the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in obtaining money for the Great Prize. "The Dorny condition is that advertising must be placed in places that do not take the camera. Limited is also a selection of companies, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, so can not be a second sponsor of the company from the same area," Vanková explained.
More money can also be obtained from tickets in the next years. "We must sit down and say what costs will actually be. And we must adapt to this," said the Brno opposition representative for the YES Movement and former prime minister Petr Vokral.
I still see as a boy who is just scattering yet, says Jan Cina
"This was a big school for everyone who did it. I loved there in Africa dance, as I have something Romani in myself, so I fully learned it," said Jan Tyna, who is considered mainly a musical actor.
A lot of fresher memories than the series The first step has the role of painter in the new film National Class. The film recognised that director Štěpán Altrichter had to attract him a lot. "It was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was created a year ago. Heavy and honest, but at the same time fun. It was touched at the National Class where I was not riding by car. A lot turned to the Southern City in Prague," he said to the Czech-German co-production picture.
"I don't feel it. I still see it as a boy who is just looking at. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I see the top far before me," he said that he didn't even think of a gracious speech in case of victory. "No, but as a child, when I listened to the radio discussion order, I always imagined how I spoke to people."
Jan Tsina has been living with his colleagues Petr Vanchura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a satisfactory relationship? "My other tips and problems to perceive as a challenge and good thing to solve," he said and remembered the division of the Czech lions when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had a new slippery shoes and a red carpet was also a guy, so he lasted for a long time and lying on the ground. He was able to make a preference from this. He had a workshop in Vanchara Stairs, where he taught how to safely fall from stairs to VIP events."
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica has received the title for several reasons. For the beginning of the 2050 plan, the carbon neutral - however, many countries were bagged under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state with a population of about five million produces only 0.4 per cent of world emissions. Costa Rica also pledged to fully move to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 per cent of buses or taxi cars going to electricity.
The official tourism organisation states that about 95 percent of renewable energy is now taking place - in 2017 Costa Rica worked for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica is proud of almost 30 national parks.
Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora covering more than half of the country's territory are also one of the main tourist trailers. "The Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and gives an example to other countries in the region, as well as the world. Climate change requires urgent steps from us all," the UN stated in the statement.
Costa Rica can be proud of almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot due to the small area of the country (51,100 square kilometres). Rain or fog forests, coral reefs or mangrove urine are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitorean waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for linochods.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter sign up to fight dry?
This summer winter has yet to bring one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic recently.
The ski area operators do not worry without technical snow, the weather complicates for example the preparation of ski resorts Jizera fiftieth.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight dry in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a panbichker in her.
Once on the middle of us, the teacher led across the whole city on the boat so that we could go on the boats along the river.
We went there once such a very wide street and whom we probably do not see in the middle - accomplices of the sect Hare Kṛṣṇa.
Of course, they met at us.
I fortunately fled, but with one friend they went into speech.
When she left them, we asked her with her teacher what she said to them.
"I asked if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul," she replied.
All, including a teacher, we laughed all the way to the boat.
We are terriblely blurred.
It doesn't happen so much, but the system is already grit, says Orozović
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We open a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders is appreciated to solve using diplomatic negotiations, even within the framework of the “Norman Group”, associating France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that Chancellor informed about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because at night we record hundreds of attempts (illegal) to cross borders.
The Chancellor discussed other sanctions to finally understand Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhuman treatment of Lukashenko's regime with refugees.
Vandal destroyed the cemetery in Dobrushka
According to the notifications received by the police, vandalism on the scattered face inside the Cemetery of Dobrus was expected to take place on Wednesday from 13 a.m. to 17 p.m.
"The material damage was calculated to CZK 60,000, and police request witnesses of events to communicate personally on a service or telephone line 158," said police spokesperson Lucie Konečná.
The criminals investigate the case as damage to foreign matters and casualties, threatening up to three years' imprisonment.
Drunk Polish regolnica blamed the accident, she tried to secret it
The car returned to the place of an accident for a while, but the car controlled another eptic that tried to take guilt on itself.
When police officers told her that it could not be preferred to drive and accidentally arrive at the driving licence, she went out with the truth, she said TVN24.
She acknowledged that another petitioner had arrived in the vehicle, who asked her for help.
Policies then came for the sister Celestine.
The breathing tests were also undergone, and after they found that they had over two passes in the blood, they immediately removed the driving licence.
At the same time, they announced that they would report to the court.
Slavs succeeded, for racist insults only pay fine
The Slovak Football Union succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for the racism of fans. The representative was originally to play without spectators a match of European qualifications with Wales, instead of now the association will only pay a fine of EUR 15,000 (about CZK 387,000).
The UEFA Disciplinary Commission punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans at a recent mutual qualification match in Budapest, which hosted by the Credentials of the Czech coach Paul Hapal won 2:1. The volume of associations for one match closed the stadium and Slovakia granted a fine of EUR 20,000, Hungary € 67,000.
After the appeal, only €15,000 was fined for an abusive political criticism, and the nearest match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship with Wales on October 10 in Trnava will be made available to fans.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, memorial wire accompanied by troubles
Five years ago, 43 university students in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been clarified. Students were allegedly detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not precisely clear what happened then, but according to the investigation, students apparently ended in the hands of the local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, says the APTN agency.
On Thursday, a memorial guide took place in the capital of Mexico, families wanted to express frustrations that they still cannot find answers and explain the disappearances of their children.
But mostly a quiet march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, which did not miss all that happened to them on the way. The vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not defend or destroy monuments, founded fires and discharged windows around the city.
Before the march, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stated that he would do everything to impact and asked the public for any information that would explain the case.
More than 142 people were arrested and one of them was not convicted, many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, the investigators allegedly had to torture, complementing the APTN.
Dog Gugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmović, however, did not care for his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked at in American priests about dogs of lovers.
However, they forgot a substantial thing: the legitimacy of the film craft.
After the coach film F. Brabce Hump - a dog who taught people to live, we are looking for another picture here.
The co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. freely follows my previous film Here I watch here from 2012.
On the scene, the speaking songwriter Hugo returns and some well-known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the Shumav Pension, who is scoming, will begin to invite the dog, Juliin the father with a partner and mainly her daughter Veronika.
It is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who lives the first love.
The director with the partner Beatriz Shajmović (which is also the producers of the film) faced the procedures described in the previous dog's image, but at least children and dogs enjoyed it.
This time she wrote a creative pair of even weaker scenarios that causes a mixture of amazingness and feelings of patience.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although the scientists, is in the desire for a child with dark wiseness and if the right “constellation” comes, cooperates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), served Colonel Mojmir despite the flying training of shots in the forest his own daughter (Julia), who falls into the comate, whereby the family is taken away by the hospital so that in the heart of the Shumav lonely can play a miraculous process of healing the dog.
Nothing against cleaning treatment of nature and the strength of animal soaps.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer appreciates what content he had filled with unprecedented situations and figures was needed for this message.
Two thiefs from the staff, the competition of pejskars, the Shumavski šarlatan, the police coming to search for "roads" and discussing herbs about the fertile strength of bone balls – and which the family in the pension is of course opposite.
When the hero takes care of the heavy commodity and sits naondulated and poured with a cigar at the family table and requires father whisky and flacotta as cured vegetarian, it cannot be confused.
On top of this, the audience’s creators explained that “this is sometimes happening after the comate”.
Shajmovich’s team lacks basic dramaturgic knowledge of working with text, the ability to exhibit bearing situations, feel for characters and point characters and directorate.
Actress performances are unbalanced, the cut is irreparable and the overall impression of excitement.
Whether Lukáš Váculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand up their party, they don’t have too much to play.
The only layer of the film remains the poetic shots of the Shumav nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of filmmakers.
It is not enough to depict a few characters, chambers and dogs of glashes, as well as more folk vulgar expressions that the characters are allowed.
You are not even flying membership in the Club of breeder breeder - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and friendship of man with a dog, the knowledge of the craft must also be if a person wants to tell a faithful story.
This did not happen in this case.
On a good family picture there is a little bit of erotic and a minimum feeling for the genre.
Not even as an advertisement on canisterapia, this amateur conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant supplements exactly from flaws like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcedness, here you can see them how you understand it, but this is just because you have never experienced it.
The decision is always on the customer if he does not want, the answer will always be not.
If you listened to the furt, you might change your opinion.
It's a job like everyone else, in which it's a brigade of ghosts.
Thomas Cook: The Bohemia were at the Mallorca from the hotel. Guarantees were not enough
The proposal for insolvency in the week was also submitted by the Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group. The future of the Czech branch is currently one, it should be decided by the end of September.
According to the Vice-President of the Association of Tourism Offices of the Czech Republic, three variants of possible solutions are available in the game - the liquidation will be announced, or the company will sell, or a new travel agency will be established from the Czech branch. "Which of them will be, but cannot be predicted, will depend on the German owner," ČTK said today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated trips, CK also solves cases where clients had to pay for their stay, although the company is trying to provide the hotel providers with the guarantee. CK promised to pay its clients payments, according to Pope, the company has sufficient security.
The problems in the hotels arose primarily in Mallorca, where the company asked for help and Czech consulate. The pope described one of the cases in which the hotel benefited all the tourist agencies there. "The hotel could not determine who belongs under the German and who belongs under the Czech society. Therefore, the hotel benefited all, even though the domestic Neckermann provided a guarantee," said. According to Šramka, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the British group Thomas Cook increased its revenue to CZK 995 million last year, with almost 21 per cent more annually resulting from the company’s annual report. Includes the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the contrary, the net profit of the company decreased by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. Since previous years, however, the company remained unreimbursed loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - next to CK Neckermann it is still the Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
The nearest east is an unusual dry month.
Winter is the only period in the year when it rains.
“This complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, Kfar Giladi village in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average in November.
Rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It didn't happen for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas balloon, rejoiced by the inhabitants of Nazareth Wassim Ashkar.
Cloudy in Israel comes almost exclusively in winter months, they are shocky and irregular.
On winter rains are dependent forests.
Without them they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supply and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water farmers have warned before dry for a long time.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall can be killed here,” said Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israel Water Authority in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as wastewater disposal or recycling.
Mountains are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tank cars arrive.
The waters and private wells dry.
“Summer orders rose from seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” Imad Sulejman said in September.
In Iran, Isfahan disappeared clashes between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protest was dry.
The root of the local river felt completely without water.
The region has the dryest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing military intervention against Iran
The Israeli Minister of Defence stated that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and that he informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz announced that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lys informed.
Gantz, who lives in the USA, is trying to convince the Americans of their pressure on Iran, but also informs Washington of military preparations.
During the press conference at Florida Gantz, he said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and the world's power "it understands that the Iranians play with them".

About 3 years ago this happened too.
I fell a bit and grilled at the interview to find out what I wanted to do after me.
Finally, I found my suspicion of pyramid was legitimate.
Because I really don't like these subfusions, so I am a daughter of doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked and left.
Quietly tell me that I'm dirty, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Museum in Semiles will return to the velvet revolution
The imitation of the normalization room with a TV in which the brutal intervention of policemen against students of November 17, 1989 in Prague takes place, even at the new exhibition of the museum in Semile, which deals with the velvet revolution. "The basis is to imagine what happened in Semile after events at the National Class," said the curator of the exhibition Tomáš Chvatal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was based everywhere the same with the fact that there was the first demonstration on November 22 in Semily, and then another people wrapped up gradually every day," said the most active group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matachi, who, as the only of the city and the nearest surroundings, signed Charter 77, and the marriages of Dedečkov, who extended the petitioners Several Sentences.
On November 27, 1989, a video from the general strike was preserved by František Tomíček, who will be launched in the loop for the entire exhibition. At that time, Ivan Voice spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily Archives also attracted a number of preserved transparency. "They were: Let's not go again with a corner, From a corner to a corruption, We don't want violence," said Hvatal. Some changes in the city were then very quickly, for example, in December, people in all Semily vote drew up that Riegrovo Square will be and cancelled the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before November events. "In the first part we represent memorials and students, what was previously such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from the Semily, whether they are transparent with different communist passwords or bronze board from the then museum of the working movement," said Hvatal. One room should just give a sense of how it could then look in the living room of ordinary households.
The last part of the exhibition is focused on what was after the velvet revolution. It is focused on the first free choice. "We welcomed one room of election posters. Who experienced it, so remembers posters With us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus even under the head of OF with a beautiful motto Everyone for his village," the curator added.

Skiers went to the mountains for a weekend, waiting for enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first larger emphasis of skiers this weekend.
After a significant snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snowfall and some skiers started operation.
The skiers did not dismiss the obligation to demonstrate a certificate of covideo for lifts.
While the lifters do not complain about customers’ inconvenience, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to cross-country trails and pistes.
The skiers laund the weather that offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, this starting weekend has actually gone since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," he praised the interest of the director of the Sports Facility Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, they had a Ski Arena Karlov or a resort in Bránn in Šumpersk.
Weekend visit was very decent, estimated at 400 people on Saturday and today.
Conditions are accompanied.
Today the sun lighted, there were about three degrees, so the perfect one did not save praise by the representative of the ski resort in Bránna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski operators can sell a ski pass only to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after the disease covid-19.
Until the exceptions are people ready for this and demonstrate the necessary documents, ČTK Rene Groneš said from the Ski Center Špindlerův Mlín.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before pandemic voices some rental and sales ski equipment.
Fortunately, interest in ski rental is.
It is not like in recent years, but still customers are enough, said Alexander Bokišov from the Skyopava shop in Opav.
Greater emphasis is expected during the period of ski courses.
The leader of the Royal Hradecian company Snowbear David Šintak feels that due to covid, there is no interest in renting ski equipment such as before.
These times before the pandemic we have been almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we were about 50 percent, said Šintak.
People, according to him, were destroyed with pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand records the rental in the Nováky area in God's Dar.
The ski rental started there a week ago and interested people must now order them in advance.
“We start leasing cross-country tickets this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect great interest as well as last year,” said the operator of the Pavlina Novakova area.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also noted in the ski school.
If we want successful and rich not to go abroad, we must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is not often possible to find a dentist or a doctor of a specialist.
Abroad leaves smart and chic people who have no property here.
The owner of the company abroad does not only go so.
But with the rest, absolutely consent.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will not just live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began by winning Orban on one beautiful day, reigning the year and at the same time raising the annual emigration by a few tens of thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic from day to day cannot feel in a similar position.
Another question is the choice at all.
When there is a foolish life, there can also win a traditional V4 maid.
Youth and education will leave, remain its supporters and people whose property cannot be cut into the aircraft.
Desive photo!
Langmajer in blood due to betting about beer?
While in the Czech Republic was full of autumn, in Thailand, the headquarters of the film Island led by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor published a bloody photo of the face on social networks.
Is it just injury, or is it a drawing for shooting?
The London police are still looking for an unknown Czech.
The last time was seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not like her behavior and we begin to have great concerns about her," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in Lambeth, where she worked.
“Their family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns and in short wants to know where they are,” she continued.
According to her on Sunday 28 November, about 19:45 she left her work and headed home to Camberwell district.
The last time was reportedly seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by some of their colleagues.
According to the British media, Srnc worked as a "Healthcare Assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.
“We have extreme concerns about our expensive colleague Petr, who is unknown,” said a group of medical facilities in the twitter contribution.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find it to contact the police,” the communication continued.
Ambassador Harriet Harman also invited the public to collaborate on Saturday on the case of Srnc during the press conference.
"It's not known for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understood to be obsolete," said Labourist politician, holding photos of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have special responsibility to try to find it, because it was outside of my home country, away from the family and worked here for our health care," said Harmanová.
The police had previously detained one man who remained in prison.
According to the BBC intelligence website, however, the police did not provide any information about the identity or the identity of the man.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTH (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't even appreciate Ukraine.
This is not a "multiple quantity", but about 8 per cent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that the threat of Invasion increases and begins to have our input full of teeth.
I felt at the top.
I don't know what he found Russia wants to war.
The war is an expensive legacy and Russia has a GDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is outside the points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this already with the First Punish War and the "anexis" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not comply with agreements from Minsk, Russia announces the funny republics.
This is all and this would be the "concentration" on the borders so matched.
Yeah, pacta sunt servanda...

Healthy snack/ lunch in the supermarket office
Hey, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option where to find food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lila.
Since I have no movement, I have no power to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy as possible and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy maximum pizza jelly and to the snack yogurt and apples.
Question: What healthy without heat treatment would you recommend to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Only the top of the tree can hide under the snow.
If the tree is destroyed, the tree can be more prone to mushroom disease.
I don't claim that this is the only reason why they prohibit us from riding outside the slopes, but it's one of them.

Hello, the other commentators have probably said everything substantially, I just confirm that the colleagues are super at the beginning, my collaborators mostly familiar with during the first semester or two familiarized, and then found the societies together, which will come to me as the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Most apartments do not advertise too long in advance, so you probably do not find it too much now, but look at the offer will certainly not damage.
Otherwise, not only Cejl but also the surroundings (the streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), but some parts of Jewish are a little ghettos.
On the contrary, the district of Veveri is a lot of students, the Queen of Field and the direction is fine, in addition, it is close to most faculties of VUT (unsure where you are exactly coming).
I've never been hiring now, but I've been born Brnák, so I can consult Brno as if you still missed any information :)
But this is an example of a completely "normal" consideration.
Due to what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely okay that the state does not fund some schools sufficiently.
Whether they learn what they want and pay it from their own or whether they eat according to the state and pay it to the state.
However, we cannot allow a private actor to control a piece of education only because a few crowns will be able to learn what he wants to make a full state contribution, and thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such claims are somewhat lost on the weight when a person writes it, who two days earlier expressed such a petition for the fighter of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against that if someone goes to abortion is the same as the voice against any statue to stand on the square?
Neckermann disturbs all years, it concerns five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann flies in connection with British Thomas Cook's insolvency and his German daughters.
"Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., speaking under the trade name Neckermann Travel Office, insolvency proposal did not submit," said Šramek in the press release.
"CK Neckermann is, however, forced to continue to disturb planned departures of its clients," he added that it currently concerns all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to the Summer Cancellation Strategy, about 500 clients will be affected. About 800 Neckermann clients who are abroad at this moment, according to him "shall be careful and ensure their safe return to the Czech Republic in their planned flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were requested to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary that clients immediately turn to the SOS line CK Neckermann," Šramek added.
The collapse of Thomas Cooka took place on Monday. This August, the travel agency concluded an agreement on which creditors had to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the amount was to be obtained from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism, which was due to become the majority owner. The second half was to be provided by bondholders and credit banks. On September 20, however, it appeared that creditors requested the travel agency to obtain a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the agreement falls. On Monday, the company announced that it beaten.
I would consult you directly with the person who asked you the job.
Otherwise, I already experienced cataloguing/digitalization that (and even long-term professionals) it either fits from the eye, or records something on the way xxx ***** or ... (according to the convention) and notes that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
I would personally deal with this in probably somehow in the note on which program you use.
If you would like to be a proper and trying student, you can look at some character databases and search for the closest one.
But because it looks like you draw from some book, I would like to advise that the author or printer simply created his own character that sits on what is physical on the coin.
PS: Isn't it accidental rather the Odessa Empire (Kingdom) than OdriNsk?
PSS: someone has already distinguished it here.

Politicians do not even know what will be a "theme" of our Presidency.
This is much worse than that they will have interpreters.
The idea that they would approve something, because no one understood any text, is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined by the word from the word, to the same basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is the case of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is suitable for informal contacts, superstandard relations.
Moreover, with those English it is quite interesting, after the performance of the GB from the EU.

The launch of a new wash is not threatened, Kremlin says. In the game there is a change in the operator
The Ministry of Transport started preparing a new tendency for the operation of a new toll system on Friday. This is a backup plan that would be used by the state if the current toll agreement was terminated competently. In addition, the state is preparing another transparency solution if the toll could not be completed in time. On Facebook, the Minister of Transport Vladimir Kremlik (for YES).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (UOGS) banned the fulfilment of the toll agreement between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with annual delay, the Ministry against this land decomposition.
"The launch of a new toll selection system is not threatened, starting today with the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the service of the new toll system, which is now finalizing the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," the Minister said.
Thus, the state would tend to look for an operator at the current toll that will be launched this December, so it would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the last tendency, nor the use of an old system that is currently operating Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be possible to prepare a new toll tendency in time. "I am deeply convinced that the OHS is dear and that it cannot be objectively prepared and implemented at the 12-month time of the toll system and transferred to the new operator such complex procurement procedures," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a transparent solution to choose a toll for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will not yet use the offer that it has submitted to the current Mitt Kapsch in recent days. The Austrian company has acquired the operation of the existing system for the event that the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believes that the basic plan will not be needed, so the Ministry will decompose the decision of the Antimonopoly Authority.
On Thursday, OHS issued a decision prohibiting the fulfilment of the toll contract, but the prohibition will begin to apply up to a year after the legal power of the decision of the Authority, which is not competent and can be submitted to the President of the Authority against it. Therefore, the Ministry and CzechToll continue to prepare a new mite that should be launched in December.
Last year, the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium won the new toll system and its operators. It has succeeded in the toll tend to offer 10.75 billion crowns for decades of operation. Against the tendency and validity of the toll contract, the current Capsch operator protested, who failed to offer more than 13 billion crowns in the competition.
Islam does not belong to the West, thinks the vast majority of Austrians
1200 respondents were asked, the survey shows a considerable lack of trust in Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of the Austrian population is concerned that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would require the introduction of a ban on construction of mosques, and 80 percent of the questioned are for greater monitoring of Islamic centres.
Most Austrians also wish Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, and they claim that, due to the presence of Muslims, they sometimes feel in their own country as foreigners.
"The result of the study is desirable," says Wolfgang Aschauer and adds: "This inclination to ethnocentrism could lead over time to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes, threatening that religious freedoms recognized by Muslims will be used."
Aschauer claims that there is no conflict between religions, but between cultures in Austria, and that dialogue and education could be helped by polarization.
According to the study, the most enemy attitudes against Muslims remain extreme right voters, people without higher education or seniors over 75 years of age, on the contrary, the most welcome are Green voters, people under 30 years of age and high schools.
According to the estimates of the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, she lives in Austria, which has approximately 8.7 million inhabitants, about 700,000 Muslims. The majority have Turkish roots. In the country there are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques and Islam has been officially recognized as religion since 1912.
I don't understand that gate on Cejl.
For the third year I have been working there and completely fine.
I'm going from work I at 10 evening and never a problem.
That is that ghetto can only tell someone who almost didn't work there in life.
Yeah, there were about most of the Romani populations in Brno, but only what they do is that they obstruct on the pedestrian and park where they don't have :D definitely it's not that I'd be afraid to climb there in the evening.
So if you are looking for a relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, so I would walk to it calmly.
There are now newly reconstructed or newly built apartments.
Felix Slovak (78) without Uncle and the lover of Helem as a bike in the fence!
Who dies Christmas?
On Sunday, most people on the advent wreath burned the first candle, Felix Slováček no.
I have no advent wreath, so it was not what to ignore.
Uncle's wreath I saw and Lucie certainly also has someone, said Blesk saxophonist who confirmed Patras's words that he often visits her.
She visits, but they were not in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
The Slovakian still doesn't know where it's going to be for the Christmas evening.
Recently we met with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Helemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček a Lucie Helemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we still talked about something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
Gifts buy continuously and Dade and Lucia certainly buy something, probably a perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the cross of a music video clip to Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to meet, says the Slovakian who was glad to meet the wife of Ludka Sobota Adrian or singer Kamil Nivlt.
And they gave it a clear idea.
Scientist warned of pollution cancer, sitting in the Turkish base
Syk, together with other scientists, participated in a study submitted by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015, and concluded that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country is related to the increasing incidence of cancer in the local population.
Scientists mentioned the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which lies about 80 kilometres from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metal races are located, people living in its surroundings suffer from cancer far more often than the international diameter.
Erdogan gets puched, international criticism despite
Sikov seemed to have no action taken by the government regardless of the clear conclusions of the study, and he wrote about the research of several articles in the opposition diary of Cumguriyet. The authorities subsequently began to seek the disclosure of secret information.
"The study clearly showed to what extent the water resources were contaminated with toxic substances," said Syk after the judgment was given to journalists. "The decision of the court shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be silent, which is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem instead of persecuting alarming people through courts," said Andrew Hardner from the Turkish AI branch.
Organizations dealing with environmental protection and human rights have long been accused of the Turkish Government of not enforcing environmental protection regulations despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
Following the fraudulent puzzle in 2016, President Taiyip Erdogan launched a large wave of arrest, now nearly 80,000 people behind the grids, including a number of Cumguriiet employees, who also built outside the service or completely missed 150,000 state employees and members of the armed forces.
Oppositions and human rights organisations accused the Government of making use of the attempt to persecute their opponents, but the authorities are defending the measures necessary to ensure national security.
And we are Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be completely idiot so that this territory is not located.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, do you explain to me now?
I do not know any other ingredient that could be applied in hospitals in the crisis.
Police are small and cannot afford it, as well as firefighters, and nowhere else is the high percentage of healthy trained people at such level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava so akorat goes to the head of previous governments, not armies, ask you for new toys for quite a long time.
Record dry in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst dry period in the last summer.
Water, according to scientists, killed in mountain and suburban areas, smaller rainfalls also record places where there has not yet been an emergency of moisture.
The causes of dryness in large part of Central Europe are climate change.
However, the impacts also strengthen the way we manage with soil.
What about dry preparation?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveler Zikmund or general Boček. Senate gave memorial medals
"The Senate was one of the first to forget and forget war veterans," said, inter alia. "The prize I took today also belongs to my friends who are no longer among us," he added.
Kubera warned in his speech before dividing the company. "Let's not forget our roots, which all of us, whether we want, or we do not want, connect, and form, because our successful present comes from these values," Kubera said.
The cardioložka and the most sensitive Czech scientist Renata Cifková, long-term rector of Tomáš Bata University in Zlín Petr Saga, a geologist, writer and traveler and popularist of science Václav Cilek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Gamz and František Pašták. The upper chamber appreciated his heritage - this January he saved the life of his neighbour and his two-year-old grandson, when he extracted them from the burning car. The medals were also received by former Presidents of the upper chamber Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch.
Zikmund worked with Jiří Hanzelka with a number of travelling excursions worldwide, collecting a number of documentary materials. Fishchen was a commentator and director of Radio Free Europe broadcasting, now working with public media. Steigerwald also acts as a drama player and scriptwriter, musician Kocab was the head of the parliamentary commission for supervision of the sentence of Soviet forces.
The medals were previously received by the astronomer and emeritious leader of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, in July on the occasion of his birthdays. By the end of the year they have the same award received by the Czech native and the first US Foreign Minister Madeleine Albright and British philosopher and politician Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called Underground University during the Communist regime in former Czechoslovakia.
Harry in the blind princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meggan?
Diana was exceptional in the fact that the artificial people caught the heart. In January 1997, she wake up a crack when she visited Africa and especially the mines field. The images on which she has a protective suit and a shield on her face became iconic, and then no one could see that a few months later princesses of human hearts in a tragic auto-accident in Paris will last come out.
Her younger son Harry now took care of when he was going to the same place after 22 years as she. He talked to the place of removal of mines in Diric in Angola, he also placed a special protective suit and formed very thoughtfully. He surely did not defend the memories of the beloved mother who came about at just 13 years.
Harry was directly on the spot where he praised the efforts of Halo Trust, which works to destroy the mines field and other explosives in countries where the war took place. "The mine fields are unhealed by the wounds of the war. We can help the community to find peace with which opportunities come," he said and appealed to the conservation and maintenance of wildlife and local rivers as water sources. After this visit, Duke of Sussex moved to Guamba to rename the local orthopedic center just after his famous mother, Princess Diane.
He did not forget to mention it even on the official instagram account: "The Duke is honoured that he can visit the place and community that were so important for his mother, get acquainted with their tireless mission and talk to all of whom (Diana) had the impression that they most needed to be heard, even if the problem was not globally popular," appeared in the post on the instagram Sussex Royal.
Royal fans, however, maybe freeze that they did not take their wife Meggan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) to take such a memories for Dian. Both of them have a program from Wednesday to Harry because of their protection. However, only taking a little baby on the mines field does not sound very safe, and Harry does not want to threaten his beloved family at any price.

Yeah, it will be so, I will still keep in ice skates, mushrooms I know what is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried at Franchise Hockey Manager) is also the overall industry.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so play two goals even if you don't have to win them differently for each prize than when compared.
But as I listen to Czech commentators what they dream, whatever men's or women's ice hockey notice, it's all strange, but it's probably all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And if it was opposite as if it was always elsewhere, and that the Czech Republic with Russia more often lost than it won, probably it would be a classic "war lost" vs "WE won".
Unsuccessful qualifications. Czech athletes are not yet in Dauga
The World Championship in Dauga started with qualification failures for the Czech athletics. Diana Mezulianiková fell at 800 metres, and the qualifications were not passed by Roman Malačová and the hammer Kateřina Šafranková, who defended the eighth place surprised by the turns in London.
Vit Müller and Marcel Johlov runs the nightmarathon race on Friday.
She fitted the third attempt of 65.46 meters and remained nearly six meters behind her maximum this year, which would have to be improved to the procedure. Malachov jumped 435 cm, 450 cm above her strength. To participate in the final, the limit of 460 cm had to be overcome.
Mezulianikov, who came to the championship for a last minute thanks to the vote from the IAAF international federation, ended in the fourth run on the last sixth side, and neither the time 2.03.48 minutes to go to the semi-final. After her maximum stayed at one and a half seconds. "I was quite quickly on me, unfortunately, I came there in a corner of the opponent, which was quite chosen by my power. I came to me that I still had strength, but there I was not enough. Soon I stopped and had to wrap again, so it was a little unpleasant. I can't be fully satisfied," the Czech representative said.
She was glad that at least one opponent was preceded in the target plane. "This was really not good, so every opponent defeated was good, but I think it was the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half-card in the discharge was Winnie Naniond from Uganda in 2.00.36.
In Dauga, the best eight-card of recent years Caster Semenia from JAR, who has too high levels of testosterone in the body, but as well as some other runners refuses treatment that have been governing IAAF rules this year.
In 100 metres, he confirmed the role of the favorite number one American Christian Coleman, who, with a time of 9.98, was the only one under the border of ten seconds. His landlord Justin Gatlin also went to the semifinal, who seeks to defend the title at 37 years. Nigerac Divine Oduduru, who is with a capacity of 9.86 twice this year's tables and expected his fight with Coleman, who has a capacity of 9.81 in this season.
Juan Miguel Echevarria has already shown a great form in the qualification of remote Kubanec Juan Miguel Echevarria, who immediately reached the distance of 840 cm in the first jump, so he has not jumped any athlete in the MS qualification for the last 20 years.
Slovenians also defeated Polish World Championships and you are in the final ME
The Slovenian volleyball players will play the European Championships with the support of nearly 12,000 storm fans in Lublani defeated the Poljaki 3:1 World Championships and are the first finalists.
Who is calling on Sunday in Paris will decide on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team worked in the semifinals much more compact than the Polish World Championships, only the beginning of the initial set and the happy end of the second set, but the domestic volleyball players were survived in defence, and only the native of Cuba Leon was pointed out by players in red and white jersey.
However, both Chebul and Urnaut squadrons and the second Stern university, which soon cut out the insignificant Gasparini, were presented in the home compilation. Police added that all previous matches at this Euro were won by sovereign, while Slovaks gained confidence after the heavy battles in play off Bulgaria and Russia.
This year, the Slovenians lost their defeat at the Olympic qualification in Gdansk 1:3, but now they are sold out to them. However, they already have certain second medals in history, in Paris they can improve unexpected silver from ME four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, Slovenians ended eight to Czech representation.
The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"I would definitely visit the CTU in Prague and look at the model of how smart cities will look like. I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, where there is no access to the public sometimes," says Jitrenka Navratilová, National Coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Institute of Anatomy offers an engaging tour and the ability to try working with surgical tools.
"I would like to take a look at the CZU and look at the Green Desert film," Navratilová adds. The commented tours will offer nine laboratories. The password of this year's Night of Scientists sounds "not to the planet".

A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, a further 74.

It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain faced "inevitable" large wave infection caused by Omikron, said on Sunday on the TV Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser to the British Health Security Office.
New quarantine measures will be needed.

Keyr Starmer, head of British labyrists, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by organizing a Christmas quiz last December when lockdown was introduced and a Christmas party was banned at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson's government gave the quiz "virtually" through a computer.
However, they participated in the Downing Street Group of Employees collected around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from the premier function is strong.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous messaging despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are confident that Johnson and his government have done legacy:
Paul Brand, ITV Commercial Television Editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the cruel majority in general elections.
Today, the Conservative Party says that it is necessary to remove it from the premiere function.
Considerable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to rotate and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring elections that can end the twelve-year-old government of Viktor Orban.
This will be the choice of European importance.
How much can you expect to be ferry?
They will not be ferry.
They will not probably be free, because they were not even the last two elections under Orban.
His side of Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to gain from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last sounds so far that everyone can choose where he wants in practice.
This allows Fidesz to convert voters from district decisions to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that the fair will not be at all.
Do you think it will be the same nefer as in 2014 and 2018?
For the situation is significantly different.
It was first about whether Fidesz won, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will gain a unified opposition.
This is a great unusual for Victor Orban and his side.
Will not try to keep much to play even harder?
Yes, we have some signs that you are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, she escaped to independent media a recording by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz Laszloa Köver, where the heads of secret services interpret that the opposition is threatened to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, this is one of the news.
Everything begins with the language.

I was quite often, last in 14, my mother's parents do not have much patience, I'm also not, her dad has long, but then I would be extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was a lot cholerical and I fled like a little terrible, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in the shrimp and was entire blue, it was about 2 times taken under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes I was screaming up, sometimes it was more likely that they no longer knew.
I am definitely also tended to solve things by violence, as little as I wanted, now for discharging at least something next, and as younger as I need parents, I cried through my hands for example (to get no power through the holder), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have this force.
I am not able to determine to what extent this is my explosiveness, but certainly my proportion also raises you.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve the same thing.
I think that to be children is simply bad and that my parents should not do it, especially at the moment when it was no longer “introductory,” but from frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply possesses something, probably it is not possible for my children not to eat at least a little, so I do not count it to them.
I don't miss it, I don't understand why OP should stand for something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
I would therefore call Kundami what laws create in such quality.
Otherwise, would I be interested in whether you are not afraid of income failures?
You can really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have what mortgage to pay from?

Scientists in their study are looking for toddlers with birth defects, so-called ankle valgosity
Valgosity (viosene) of ankles is a defect that affects five to ten percent of children. It is treated with intensive exercise. Scientists try to help these children even more, so they developed special shoes that should significantly accelerate the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will wear healthy children and children with diagnosis to map the effect of both groups. Participation in research will not have any risks for children and measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunova, research leader of the Faculty of Sports Studies of MU.
Parents of both groups of children may report to the study via a website where there is a registration form and all information.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with diagnosis and fifty children who are healthy and will always wear health shoes half of each group.
"The moment when parents should apply to their child is the moment when they descend into the first separate steps, typically empty for example, furniture that is held during the trial of walking. Participation in the research covers three measurements within seven months of the first steps of the child, each lasting about 20 minutes, in the middle of the participants also includes wearing tested shoes," Gymunova notes.

Where does Slovakia move the process with the enemies of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main lecture begins in the process of square appeals against the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kochner and his involvement in the top Slovak policy and justice.
How will the process mean for Slovakia?
Sparta is really acquired this year, recognizing the hradecian side Nedomlel
In his case, the motivation is increased more than understandable. Hradec Ice Hockey Defender Richard Nedomlel will go on Friday match against the club where he recently worked. The former spartan is convinced that similar to that will be his co-players, be jerseys of the Prague club never dressed.
"Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull out," says the horseback side before the match of the 5th extraligary bike.
Hradec Králové is trying to stretch his series of wins, which at this moment reads three-point wins behind him. After Kladn, Pilsen came the most award-winning fans on Sunday, Mountfield went to the neighboring Pardubice.
"We can't look at the matches that were, but we need to focus on the matches that are waiting for us now, and play them the same, if not better," says Hradec defender.
The castles should not even look at the last year’s balance with Sparta. In three of the four matches they lost, points took only once after the victory in Prague after extending, and the leadership of Sparta led several significant reinforcements in the summer and expected a return between the top.
"Sparta always had quality players, but what we will talk, this year you are really charged," Nedomlel admits before the first match end of this week.
And the second one? Also nice laughter, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třínci.

Father Lucie White didn't do her at all, you don't believe what she should live!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bila (53) is the original profession of a schvalenka and his own name Hana Zanaková, probably not in the Czech Republic, but the singer herself now recognised that she worked in a glassworker!
Lucie White knew from a relatively cornerstone age that she wanted to be a singer, and love for singing was born in her, when she performed as a little girl in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the panic still lives.
"And I will remember exactly where my mother was sitting, then a singer was born in me," she admitted to the radio Impuls.
However, her father feared a little about the future of his daughter and recommended that she issue a journey of craft that has golden days.
"This always said, 'The craft of a girl, the craft. Come on the ground!' Even though I don't want to go to the local glasswork. Glasswork doesn't work anymore, I'm yeah. I'm taught skilled and I'm at home from beads of different roses and pendants, which I then put on auctions and buy wheelchairs for money," she added with laughter.

Comment by Jana Šindelare: Drive tracks as a company
Heavenly election, even though it was apparently not completely smooth, is the conclusion of a sad story about the inability of the state to give a clear direction to the way. The office has been incomplete over a year and it does not change even after the middle evening, because one of the members resigned.
The selection process itself has already been due to a significant reduction in the requirements for candidates primarily in the field of practice since the beginning of the fracture. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was in operation in the past decreased. First, the members of the selection commission and then the supervisory boards played only the role of pimprlat.
Heavenly presented the weakest professional CV from five finalists at all, yet without experience from a large company, experienced fighters from the leadership of logistics and transport businesses. The participation of interesting private sector managers was apparently the lightest page (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, they already know that they played only the role of narrative balls in the political game.
Perhaps heavenly surprises, manifests a great talent and eventually turns out to be the best chief of the roads of all times. At least in the beginning it will be accompanied by a failure of political traffic. Czech roads are not waiting for a light period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalization of the market and lack of employees in operation. I miss engineering, moving and mechanics. What should be motivated to further work and respect for management when behaving in the top leadership as an elephant in porcelain?
The second important group is the creditors. As the players at the head of the road put, we will see next year in the spring, when they will defend the rating. Certainly, the creditors feel instability. It is sad that someone else is going to Moodi's for the Czech Railways to have a rating every year. The Agency often changes in the management of the road and political influence on the company did not escape, criticized them in summer.
The Movement of YES is a password that the state needs to be managed as a company. To begin with, it would be enough if one large state company managed as a company, and not as a state. Czech railways still belong to the largest companies in the country and would be good if they were the best. They voted, but to become them misleading. Surely, it can be refused that the post in the leadership of the road was always political matters, but then we can forgive the chessers with the selection procedure.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal by Minister Karl Havliček needs to be substantially redrafted
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end and the law, which should ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens when choosing and authorizing the deep storage of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Government after aviation prosthetics by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is seriously contrary not only to the communities concerned associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also to the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects a stronger strengthening of its possibilities in repository decision-making, which is promised by the Mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which requires the Czech atomic law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to redraft the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform available, refers to the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of repository sites is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a general intention almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes citizens practically just a statistical figure in authorisation proceedings.
The design misses systemic compensation settings for municipalities for the whole process of searching and choosing a location for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities really have no excessive opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in searching for repositories.
Only in some authorisation proceedings may submit their comments or appeals, however, the Office or Minister decides to issue the authorisation.
The case does not have a delay in carrying out research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-government that the Platform calls for is the principle of common use in many democratic advanced countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced in repository permits, as in Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, among other things, another failure of the state administration to hire an external legal office for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which concluded SURAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemank.
The total amount for these works is to be almost CZK 4 million according to the contract registry.
Antonín Seknička, the vice-chairman of the village Cejle from Hradek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the ministers of industry who streamlined the position of self-government against government authorities in search of depth storage of highly radioactive wastes only sent to their successors, we are waiting for a stronger turnover from the new government.
We also offer an auxiliary hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for its support, which considers the issue of insufficient municipal rights in such a fundamental building as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the State's access to burned nuclear fuel management and other radioactive wastes that will not be limited to depth storage only.
The Platform further encourages the decision to select a location for any storage to be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear to lose weight: Harmonized 90 kg.
Although he had nothing to change in his lifestyle for years, he was finally afraid of doctors.
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
And it took it.
Goodman gradually agreed 90 kilograms, which is half of its original weight 180 kg, informs The Sun.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the thickness of the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different man!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his big body caused cracking furniture.
"I all shook in my mouth," said the actor in 2018 in an interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Fuck, exercise.
I get to the age when I can't afford to sit on the spot, he said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss you want to use in.
If it is a text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it would be a formal and, perhaps, a university text, I would probably be looking for how boss would rather describe or explain.
There are more types of boss to all.
The game like Dark Souls, etc. has a few boss that yeah, and so is "boss" something like a master / ruler of the given level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games are hidden by boss (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat at all so that the game or level is completed, but are often even stronger than standard boss.
Then you need Half-Life games where the boss are, but the player is not directly scared with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called at all?
And then they are mini boss.
It is unambiguously unambiguous to translate boss simply probably nowhere, Czech and neither other languages do not solve it (interestingly, only Catalan, which bosse translates as the final opponent).
It is shortly for a story or game generally important, computer control, enemy stronger than all previous and watching completion of some level or task.
And where are you viewers? Dauga can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back because drinking to Dauga voluntarily and consciously dismissed the athletic atmosphere prevailing at the sold stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championship in Berlin.
Giant transparency on the walls of clouds in Dauga invites to "the biggest sports event of 2019", however, fears of how dignified its cuisine will grow.
"Tickets for the goal are sold for all dinners," says the organizers.
But it's too little.
The upper occupancy of the Chalifa stadium with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators is already covered with varieties of coloured sails at which the flags of 209 participating countries are also shown. Atletics in Qatar was released in the territory where despite the annual mitigation of the Diamond League is not forgiven by roots.
It is not surprising that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the Championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, i.e. at a cost of CZK 400.
The organizers are now going to fill the uncovered parts of the rostrum from at least half. Therefore, according to the sources of the British sheet Giuardian, they allegedly distribute free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children, who Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAAF athletic association, can comment positively: "The right we can inspire next generation."
Rich Qatar in the past gained world championships in gas and cycling, after athletics, will come to a number of football in 2022. The financial offers of oil power will always be lucrative for rich sports federations, such as the reality of today's sports world.
But even though we will join it and remember the absence of fans at the stadium, we will not defend the very sports enthusiasm that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletes Championship on the Arab Peninsula should be timed better - and for another year. Extremely late, forced by climate, gathers the whole season scheme in the pre-Olympic year, and thus preparing for the key season of the Olympic, which, under normal circumstances, started in October.
Perhaps Qatar will replace at least technological news, with which it promises ultra-modern and attractive championships. That's just 37 degrees? Now the stadium's flat is artificially air-conditioned to four-two. And advanced cameras built directly in blocks have also TV viewers to get closer in detail, what happens in the athletes in the networks seconds before and just after the starter shot.
After the disappeared Peter of London, the whole world is looking for.
Czech police also participated.
After Peter Srnc's disappearance, the British police have been patrolling since December 3.
Czech police also participated in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been looking for since December 7.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petro Srnc saw her colleagues last November 28.
The British police belongs to it from 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circuit breaker.
The whole world looks after Peter.
"The Czech police works closely with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
“We share information together for the case,” she added.
The announced search for Peter appeared on the police website.
According to him, 168 centimeters are high, it is weighted and has brown eyes and long straight hair the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues fear her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman also participated in the search for Petro.
She participated in the drawing of flyers with Petra's face.
“We have tremendous concerns about it,” she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British policemen have already detained one suspect.
But it is not clear about whom it was and what he had to do with Peter.
The Czech Republic terrorizes the Tesla Agent.
While data showed a slight decline in attack campaigns in October, last month, the attacks were significantly reinforced by the end of the year.
We witnessed a large campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
Attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of attackers remains the same so far.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should draw attention to the names that refer to payments and financial transactions in the user.
While last month it had a dangerous attachment to the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the receipt correction for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Irkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Any code actively searches for saved login data that is subsequently sent to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the coming holidays and end of the year attackers will grow again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook was slightly weakened in November, but it remains worth a few fifths of all detections.
Attacks continued throughout the month with increased activities on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contains the most common attachment to the .exe file extension that was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for Czech users.
A significant decline and suppressive activity are recorded by security analysts at Fareit, who stood at 1.6 per cent of attacks and had no more attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.

Microplastics got to human intestines, confirmed for the first time the study
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. The team under the leadership of Professor Philipp Schwabla University of Vienna published a study that shows for the first time the presence of microplastics in the human capital. The study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small particles of plastics between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in samples of all investigated persons. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them were avoided by sea fish, all drinking water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would actually be so a little miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either manufactured directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetic industry, or arise from the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in sea animals, insects, cocktail waters and lemonades; shortly everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive unit of man was officially confirmed. On ten grams of the capital there were about 20 particles of microplastics and scientists estimate that they will have more than half of the world's population.
Little particles can reach the blood speech or the lymphatic system and end, for example, in the liver. "It is at all the first study of their kind and confirmed what we have thought of for a long time. Now, when we have the first evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to explore what exactly means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in intestines can negatively affect the immune reaction of the digestive system, thus easier to absorb poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And yet there is no other solution than limiting the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. This will, however, be difficult - the first task standing in front of governments and the authorities will at least stop its steep growth. Only as regards plastic bottles, experts estimate that in three years their humanity consumes a fifth more than today. At the same time, the pace is cutting millions of bottles boiled per minute. Every year ends in the sea and oceans about eight million tons of plastic. Waste threatens the marine
Some states have already adopted restrictions and other measures, for example, Kenya - under the threat of dragonic punishments - prohibited plastic bags. The European Commission considers minor prohibitions (good known brokers) in the same direction as the domestic Ministry of the Environment. However, criticism argues that such measures are nice but absolutely insufficient.
