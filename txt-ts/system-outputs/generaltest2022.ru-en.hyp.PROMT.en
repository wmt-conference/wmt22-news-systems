From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for adolescents.
Teenagers in general are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
Model "Micropacket Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different side stiffness: the medium-rigid surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - by a plate of natural latex.
A spring unit with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, breathable materials should be distinguished.
The latex, perforated for breathability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is the coconut coira.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The mattress is also subject to an extended warranty period.
The period of official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and pollution is assigned to the removable jacquard case supplied with the kit.
Pair an orthopedic pillow to the mattress - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

So there is no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests are on the doorstep, and on the stove, the cutlets are still being reeled out, the mother braces the floor.
Lord, yes, I sat down at the table without strength.
And then more dishes with change, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
And what are the guests?
They are good, and the cake must be with them.
Since then I have not liked the holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table according to the minimum.
And I cook goodies for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: The fourth vaccination against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite the active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for full protection.
Ulrich Weigeldt, head of the Association of General Practitioners, is convinced of this.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against influenza."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron."
Moreover, the new option is especially dangerous.
Thus, the likelihood of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, the manufacturers of BioNTech/Pfizer by March 2022 plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert emphasized.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not just for fishing.
These vibes have a larger specific gravity than those of analogues close in size, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting decoys.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when caught in a plumb, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most subtle is simple monotonous animation, that is, the up-and-down movement of the rod almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space littered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles for which a hook is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching walleye and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when point and aggressive bait supply is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib flips instantaneously and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is equally successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To please its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with or without a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib with a plumb game is able to irritate a passive pike that does not even react to live animals.
When caught, the Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This wobble is clear and not capricious, well combined with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For fishing, the growth of pike, walleye, ruffle or perch is, in addition to uniform, relevant and "step," sometimes with "chirping" along the bottom.
If you catch in locked places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catches.
It can be used with equal success in both relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, announced 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches at Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), "Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain Presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, uses an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency said in a publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner has the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries, "the article says.
According to the media, the Wagnerites allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group does not appear either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the formulary lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
We will remind, earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominant in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly decreasing," the article says.
Against this background, the Libyan High Election Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more success in the country's foreign policy than failure, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of success -" in Syria they defended, restored peace there, "" the decision on Nord Stream-2, "" the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons, "" we squeezed Crimea. "
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," "isolation from the world," says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The Dubai government announced a complete rejection of paper paperwork and the transition to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," the emirate's crown prince, chairman of Dubai's executive council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document management in all Dubai state institutions will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: health care, housing and communal services, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to electronic government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid a depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance in 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% inferior to last year's indicator.
And if according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector showed positive dynamics by last year, then by the end of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all industries.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, Kazinform correspondent reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the instructions of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127" On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Deferred Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses "was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting a deferral of loan payments provided for the provision by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities of a deferral of payments on loans issued until April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The grace period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME.
In the borrower's application, a different period of deferred payments could be indicated.
During the deferral period, claims and claims work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended against the borrower, "the deputy prime minister said.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferral of payments on loans from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SMEs received a deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
The MFIs applied for a deferral of 131 SMEs, of which 95 subjects were granted a deferral in the amount of 105.8 million tenge, "A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily transfer the strain "Ocmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the Okmiron strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason is worth looking for in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "Ocmiron" originated in the body of an infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, with a mutation, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no answer from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that immunocompromised people can tolerate "ocmiron" more easily than those with a strong body defense response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So this happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people die 30-year-old, and old people 60-year-old in the form of which they tolerate it.
The immune response is rabid in the young, it is completely inadequate: where you could only shake your finger, it hits like a gun on sparrows, "concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is fever, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin to vaccinate.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, like the pupils of kindergartens, - Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the MIPT genomic engineering laboratory, told Moscow 24.
Huge gratitude to the author for this article.
I refreshed my memories with pleasure...
Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, not a single dance floor was without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, arranged dances to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of covid
The authors of the work studied the adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to avoid an immune system response.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
Biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person can hardly navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible, "he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by addiction habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of exercise, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic involvement.
Earlier, professor at the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FSAEI HE RNIMU named after V.I.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Impairment of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return to its homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, "he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Now employees of the department are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon returning, cultural values ​ ​ are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the ancient skeleton of a man discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the subject of art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, has been kept in a private collection and has not been listed since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological surveys of "black diggers."
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turkic language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank enjoys the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote operation, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to resolve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline before which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but difficult for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego."
He is already outside of any literary associations, broke with Imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, at times we scold critics, even viciously, but the reading public is ready to carry it in his arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them were real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Sovetskaya Rus."
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat concluded an agreement with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
None of the poets modern to Sergei Alexandrovich received such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
Funds that year were needed more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofya Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip family life, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice in, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare had materialized from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I myself do not know where this pain came from.
Either the wind whistles
Above an empty and deserted field,
That l, like a grove in September,
Showering the brains with alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin passed strongly, looks bad, is clearly sick.
Rumblings, nervous breakdowns are increasingly repeated.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was put to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there were no reliable documents left.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan improved his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible novel with a green serpent developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
"I only came to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunk state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, scratched his face and wheezed.
Having come to his senses a little, he began to cough incessantly, spraying the whole sheet with blood... "
Yes, and Yesenin himself after the voyage in Europe and in the United States (in the States then there was a prohibition, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I saw nothing there except taverns and streets...
In the end, I stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because longing gnawed. "

All energy is directed to choosing what he will earn for a living.
He is far more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who had a history of legal troubles before the wedding itself.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl burst into tears on the exam when she had not yet failed it?
Why he didn't tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
Retake.
Millions of students know this.

Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he "is actively looking for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
Minsk in response introduced a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a laughing stock out of a man
The 2021 social events were dominated by velvet blazers.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket to The Earthshot Prize eco-award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charitable foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to service analysts, received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to be bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are featured in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto went to one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House."
When choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interweaving the threads, a dense fabric is obtained with a fleecy external texture and a smooth inside.
More budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so a jacket like this is perfect if you're going to a party or a gala," Vakhoshkin explains. - It is suitable for those cases if the invitation contains the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion, compliance with which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with prosperity," say the authors of the Handsome Brummell Telegram channel about men's fashion. - Owners of velvet jackets tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Things that are too simple and everyday will look out of place.
Fashion experts from Handsome Brummell are sure that the appearance of an ordinary employee at a corporate party in a velvet jacket will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who refuel this event, then -" yes, "he has such a thing in the topic."
If the employee of the rank is lower, and his goal is the desire to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not according to Senka hat," - say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, so tortured pulls.
And not at all associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I do not understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it pays.
Billions in investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not at stake - both gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
There is wild demand for fuel.
A penny drips.
And then who is in flight?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do Indian issues touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "overslept" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I did not see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it on the entire carriage, then they will not be hooked to such, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties (-its)," but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave conscious of his slave position and fighting against him, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not recognize his slavery and grows fat in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose salivations flow when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and enthuses about the good and good master, is a holop, ham. "
Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron."
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With the previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, urging, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to start revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he was ill and vaccinated, or was vaccinated and ill, then he received" hybrid immunity, "that is, there are a lot of antibodies and neutralizing enough," the expert said.
The G7 warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
Further, the ministers urge Russia to "weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities," which US President Biden spoke about during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the G7 foreign ministers also say.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response, "they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response, "the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would undergo "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a single voice of the G7 countries, which account for the 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine considered 32 times less effective from omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to the rest of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the effect of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kyiv
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kyiv's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to destroy drones.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnik expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will retain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Kyiv expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of the Federal Republic of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Ways to recover money stolen through online retailers revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online retailers and not fall victim to fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of cybercriminals, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Some of the savings can be saved in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when buying in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure, responsibility rests with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," said a representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and returned.
It is noted that in some cases online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, said that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under current circumstances could be to create a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Moravecki said that he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany, bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one reason for the controversy.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany about shutting down the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position confirmed by G-7 officials on Sunday.

And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruising.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medicine without clarifying the reason for the appearance of any symptom.

Plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the major Lakewood Evangelical Church, where Pastor Joel Austin is preaching, promising that pious Christians will face wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was renovating one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive gratitude from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say," You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do, "" KPRC-TV quotes him.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks that were stored in a church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no losses.
Nevertheless, an award of $25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim that amount as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions are her characteristic "as a real person."
Therefore, the attitude towards it is so negative.
And the point is not that "she is financially significantly richer than all pisaks," as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as brazenly, as defiantly as this madam.

Brazil obliged citizens to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to demand covid passports from those entering the state, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
It is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate from vaccination.
Also on the list of exceptions are persons who arrived from countries where the absence of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for holding New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered tourists unvaccinated from coronavirus infection to comply with a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of complete protection against COVID-19 is disclosed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein, in an interview with Ura.ru, revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With internasal use, immunoglobulins A are formed in a large amount. When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside after vaccination, we most of all form immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you will receive a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination, "the doctor said.
The chief preventologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case the body's protection, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked with a male (I died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feed, affection, love and games for a flowing bitch, then go ahead.
But the song was trained and generally clever.
I chose my society and went home.
In the video, a method that works 90% of the time.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so as not to run after the dog, although they wailed that out, 200 thousand were running away (Pomsky), directly took her hand and took her away in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests of opponents of vaccination do not stop
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters saying "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.

WHO has discovered "omicron" in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus "omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say the spread of the new strain could be catastrophic.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO message.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the delta strain in terms of distribution, it is also the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain is able to have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the omicron will displace the delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases only in Britain will be about 1 million. This despite the fact that officially "omicron" is currently sick in the Kingdom of several hundred people, and according to estimated data up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at their peak, more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to the rest of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the omicron is still unknown - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimova, Product Director of Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real records involving the victim.
Thanks to this, neural networks manage to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or incriminating pseudo-scripts," the expert said.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks in the case when it comes to technologies using video.

Five actions listed to help avoid diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affect metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess quantities.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by poor nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to a feeling of fullness, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being on weekends
The reason for the deterioration in health after working days is often a "weekend migraine," said Zukhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics are especially often affected by this, who have headache, breakage and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to a change in conditions.
Over the weekend, our lives are fundamentally changing.
"We sleep for a long time, all day we lie on the couch, most likely we eat more, and we drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to lack of coffee, a little breakage begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and breakage. "
A late climb plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracing what changes the most over the weekend.

South African scientists declare low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South Africa announced low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists of the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "omicron") corresponds to (the level) of vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the coronavirus omicron strain could cause a new pandemic wave in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may feature several dozen names, essentially referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other concealed sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and many different sugar names.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues to switch to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany by 2045 plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, since at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement that recorded Berlin's support for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline so far "does not comply with the instructions" of the European Union.

Hackers hack Indian PM's Twitter
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that they quickly reacted on Twitter - they restored access to the account.
The Indian prime minister's page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, a majority of New Caledonian residents voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has become significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, in total more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As the France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt," as supporters of independence urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak following this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has in many ways reinvigorated the final weeks of France's presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated repeatedly.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
Still, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the Caledonian choice to be France's choice."

WSJ readers criticized the article about relations between Russia and the United States

When transferring nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the accompanying loss of moisture and causes essence to penetrate deep layers of the skin.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin to produce new generation jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, they will begin to create ANKA-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was announced on December 11 by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Oleksiy Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air targets, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like, "he is quoted as saying Диалог.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is the new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, in which they will conduct personnel training, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from container at airport
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
It is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were sent.
One of the fugitive lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which operates all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less at risk of getting some types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose opposite contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer only increases if it deviates significantly from this figure up or down.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid milk flakes and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine described folic acid as a substance that slows down ageing.
Because it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men after the age of 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75 thousand people may die due to the omicron strain
Forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus in the next five months, up to 75 thousand people may die in England if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group for emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected daily.
"Serious coronavirus measures may be needed to prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines cannot rule out infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at its current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.

Demand for superyachts rose by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has been no such hype in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the paper shipyards were taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are ready to pay more, if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling to space, living on yachts or flying on their own planes causes irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all other humanity.
Economists are calling governments to action and proposing to introduce new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, only the number of super yachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool," as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On existing super yachts, helicopter platforms, open-air cinemas have become common, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of wrestler McGregor, a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at the American University of Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance when you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times the footprint of the average resident of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of SO2 per year, then the largest polluter on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail settled down on his 162.5-meter-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if there is no owner on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't get other people's sympathy when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no berth space for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels to crumble 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to bowel cancer identified
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages a week increase the risk of cancer.
Writes about this edition of the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that drinking four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderate drinking men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process detrimental to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers, are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how much the four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
While the dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as that of humans, the new study proves that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, while they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions is not yet enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of learning ability they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, prepared for the bargaining of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere."
If you are offered something deliberately unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offering.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned, "the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kyiv.
"Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to detect and deploy countermeasures," he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Exhibition of Rail Transport and Equipment Production, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said company spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was commissioned earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed."
In May this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe came off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for the production of equipment for railway transport is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade/CCMT/.
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese manufacturing of high-end equipment in the global market," Feng Yaoxiang said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, having conducted a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system for the production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary means and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and in terms of operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
Signs of future dementia, he said, could be forgetfulness, as well as a whole host of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, reduced levels of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
Alzheimer's disease and cerebral vascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome, he added.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages ​ ​ and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining moderate levels of exercise, regularly training cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory involvement and thinking logic," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychonereal treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the council of doctors created under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character, "the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president must be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call this neurorehabilitation and psychonertial rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials disciplined him.
Georgian politics quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore itself to its former rights.

At the same time, they receive full medical care.

We feed all the drunks, drug addicts who also lost their health because of their stupidity.

These amounts could be spent on the treatment of really sick people.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of protesters was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, ​ ​ COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment establishments.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their poster, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, over 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit venues for mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a previous illness, or a medical diversion from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and planes.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will raise 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, near the Winter Olympics venue, has become increasingly popular with Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping is also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the infrastructure necessary for recreation there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, close to the Winter Olympics venues.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
A high-speed railway was run from Beijing to Chongli two years ago, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Catering points with dishes of national cuisine are opened on the slopes.
Taiwu now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down humanity's progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to failures in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health protection systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The WHO and the WB stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket."
In October, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have practically no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcast at 'Summit for Democracy' at White House request
A speech by Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang at a panel discussion during the US-organised Summit for Democracy has been put into video-free mode, a YouTube recording of the summit shows.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms Tan was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world by the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted on it in green as "free," and the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Vietnam in red as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map, which was demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the "one China" policy, which Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy organized by Washington was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long road of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a lopsided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion following the long journey that we have passed with the current administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday, "the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are associated with the desire of the United States to impose approaches on a variety of issues on Russia.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress is being made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may have allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by a virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with a nasal vaccine at airports and shopping centers, but I would do this at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that a person after that sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary, "Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person vaccinated with nasal congestion blows out after injection.

Alexander M., Please remind me of the style of the marathon at the 2021 World Cup?

Attention, question - what does Klebo do to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the ski track if he was walking from behind at the turn in front of the target?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago...
I was, and in fact I was not the driver.
There were rights, but he could not ride.

During the day, 1239 cases of infection with a new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected in the UK.
This informs Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that 75 thousand people could die in England by April due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the omicron strain.
Peskov warned of suffering Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions if "aggressive actions" against Ukraine continue, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that everyone in the world understands this.
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonian residents reject idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was announced on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of those who voted against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were canceled.
The level of participation in the voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia in a referendum spoke out against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the location of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its domain.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, under which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice within two years.

WHO tentatively considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that the "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data on a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered antigen profile of the omicron strain protein suggest reduced vaccine efficacy against infection and variant transmission.
According to preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of the disease" - ed.) May be less severe than with the "delta," "the WHO said in a technical statement.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta."
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said that there is no reliable data yet that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, called four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and may also make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called an "ideal storm," assumes that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development of events will contribute to the deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <... > internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) , "the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on Donbass, as a result of which confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former people's deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between groups of the population and the president who disagree with Zelensky, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives."
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the authorities," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation."
A certain event can lead to this, which will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
This option for the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low values, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-president of the country Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from melons and not earlier than early August.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "They give 10 days for Yevtushenko's quote, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag # poetvrossiibolshempoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under the administrative article on a repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 on Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of the culture common in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you during the arrest this time and earlier?
What was asked in the department, how did you comment on your action?
This time, the employees were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how funny it sounded in some context of the word.
Riot police took on Pushkinskaya and took it tough.
They asked standard, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandably.
With the exception of the monkey blown to all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going to.
And if after the action, under this hashtag, they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I will sit for 10 days for a reason.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of those around them, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, a transcript is kept in the old fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements, which contribute to better blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root crop contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age disorders.
Due to the large content of the print, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and if used regularly, it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to simmer or cook the root crop, and not fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate foods that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.

According to market participants, only imports will be able to replace the shortage of products at the moment.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex
Relegation candidates
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated Runet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Ghazaryan, general director of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to, among other things, a regular change in the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Squid" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan, the original series of the largest ivi video service in Russia (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto," but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later, "TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media).

Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate Orthopaedic Spring Mattress.
The model is convenient in that it has two surfaces that are different in softness - high stiffness and slightly more than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: In the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackets."
This means that there are 2,000 spirals per sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropacket" is the highest frequency of the entire variety of Dimax spring blocks, therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coira and natural latex layers are installed at the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has a latex, then the other has a coconut coira.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of classical, since it conveys to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coira provides correct support for the back, then the latex gives adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in an Aloe Vera knitted knit case.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopaedic foam, which is used in a mattress, is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of missions starting after five years is to assess the suitability for life of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be whether it is similar to the earth or different.
If very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it may be more likely that life originated on Earth, "said Mihkel Payusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverse will change Russian business
The metaverse theme took off this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's transformation into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverse and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverse should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend for the creation of remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of the business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models for them.
From the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go digital.
Anya, you are right, changing nutrition is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have both traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one forces me to eat up on everyone at once.
You can eat on a spoon, try - and enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can cook any tasty and healthy dishes.

British economist failed to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts would turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in the price of goods was temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived its usefulness" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty levels and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the global research department "Opening Investments" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Shulgin named the Fed's monetary policy, oil price dynamics and concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing pleases: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.

There is progress, only sluggish.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
At the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and in increasing the weighted average price of a car - over the year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz were stronger than the dynamics of the rise in price.
At the same time, sales volumes from Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the committee of automakers of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz at the same time has a good increase in sales and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence a greater increase in financial capacity," explained Tatyana Arabaji, general director of NAPI. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic indicators, which also significantly increased financial capacity this year. "
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth dynamics demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year, in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in units in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red at all - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of auto components and production interruptions that covered the entire global auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite price tags for their products and other automakers.
The volumes of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of auto concerns to win back past losses, experts say.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially shift the costs of past periods to the consumer, which they could not put in the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital for the automotive industry. -
I believe that financially, automakers are doing very well now, maintaining a high sales margin. "
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which are observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and complication of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow and next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, said Sergey Burgazliev, an independent consultant for the automotive industry.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are striving to get the greatest profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes. -
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold more expensive than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The US leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of an "invasion" of Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kyiv, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burda and wash another cup, it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an eichar layer, where you immediately talk with the leader.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another power structure, then it is ineffective to immediately reset, and it is most likely not to be able to blacklist.
Because in order to confirm his lies about involvement in law enforcement agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
That's the nonsense...
I don't believe at all that it was.

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, in my opinion, you, to put it mildly, are not in the topic.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
