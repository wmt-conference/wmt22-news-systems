The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and going to his big cats' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets into his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats fearful patients.
The inspector has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is hired anonymously before each suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients end up facing their fears in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to her death on purpose)
This facing of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author.
If this plot is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.

All Bosch power tools, pneumatic tools and measuring tools are carefully checked, tested and are subject to the strict controls of Bosch quality assurance.
Bosch therefore gives a guarantee for Bosch power tools, pneumatic tools and measuring tools.
The buyer's claims for liability for defects arising from the purchase contract with the seller and statutory rights are not restricted by this guarantee.
We provide a guarantee for these tools in accordance with the following conditions:
We provide a guarantee in accordance with the following regulations (Nos. 2 - 7) by remedying defects in the tool free of charge, which can be proven to be due to a material or manufacturing defect within the guarantee period.
The warranty period is 24 months, 12 months for commercial or professional use or equivalent stress.
The guarantee period begins with the purchase by the first customer.
The date on the original purchase receipt is decisive.
For all commercial, blue power tools and measuring tools purchased from September 1, 2004 (with the exception of high-frequency tools, industrial cordless screwdrivers and compressed air tools), the warranty period is extended to 36 months if the buyer registers these tools within 4 weeks of the date of purchase.
Battery packs and chargers as well as supplied accessories are excluded from this warranty extension.
Registration can only be done on the Internet at www.bosch-pt.com/warranty.
The registration receipt, which must be printed out immediately, and the original purchase receipt, which shows the date of purchase, are considered confirmation.
Registration is only possible if the buyer agrees to the storage of his data to be entered there.
Excluded from the guarantee are: Parts that are subject to normal or other natural wear and tear, as well as defects in the tool that can be traced back to normal or other natural use, abnormal environmental conditions, irrelevant operating conditions, overload or lack of maintenance or care.
Defects in the tool caused by the use of accessories, supplementary or spare parts that are not original Bosch parts.
Tools where changes or additions have been made.
Minor deviations from the target condition that are irrelevant to the value and usability of the tool.
The defect recognized by us as subject to a guarantee is rectified in such a way that, at our discretion, we repair the defective tool free of charge or replace it with a perfect tool (possibly also a successor model).
Replaced tools or parts become our property.

For professional reasons, I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we cannot help them.
I'm well aware that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help with that in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, looking back on the cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
But that didn't subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the bare result, the way the performance was performed disappointed.
A statistic should be mentioned as a substitute, which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?

While in Patrick's team even top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points after being 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to argue.

Help with your first own campaign
Greetings Boron!
I'm currently leading the adventure Across the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly take my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow has been made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further plot should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be luring the heroes into an ambush.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If you don't notice, the goblins lurk in a hollow path for the heroes and flank the carriage, armed with bows to each left and right, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If there is a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village shoulder, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think the deus ex machina of solution 2 is?
Is the encounter too much as a start to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm guaranteed to take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cut off in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the accident at the start, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
Apparently, however, F1 takes precedence for legal reasons and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was again ignorance of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on the subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I believe that you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 on a pay TV station.
It's also not the first guesswork as to what is now possible or required by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' artificial comment style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like RTL's Heiko Wasser better.
In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out lap Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two broadcasters also do less advertising in training than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of reruns.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Apart from the advertising, RTL does a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.

A treasure chest, shell or something similar would be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air vent or similar using a 4/6 mm air hose... and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher as the water level and mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a non-return valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to run backwards, that the water would run out of the pool through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket system "New Shepard".
The flight, which lasted around ten minutes, took off and landed in the western state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself received the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, clad in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a Nasa astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their tickets.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
He worked hard on his assignments and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space flight: the first, in July, saw Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, included 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, best known for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy boss Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Extra stress before holidays & bank holiday weekends
This topic came up for me last week.

That's why only now a post to it.

Most people and businesses have a bridging day on Friday, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend coming up last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to be sent out before Ascension, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-indulgence about holidays?
Why do we still have holidays when we can't really treat ourselves to them?!
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all on their own.

NEKTON-Bio gives the bird smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is exclusively due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.

GDR handwork model old building E-locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway company ME issue 11/1968, used with signs of wear and missing parts see photos, function well, the class E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are refurbished to be operational
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A top speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG suspension drive with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given road numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of what later became the GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives came to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, the suitability of all six locomotives for refurbishment was determined.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network progressively increased the need for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were first preferred.
It was only when it was foreseeable that the number of refurbishments on the E 94 could not be increased further that the E 95 became the focus of the refurbishment.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to release the contactor with a hammer and wooden wedge while driving.
Damage to the traction motors was common and led to months of locomotive failure.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operations was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to man electric locomotives with one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initially external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is supervised by the museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, works well, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary, dusty, with signs of wear, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and signs of storage.

To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the LinkedIn social network
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly unvaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far he has refused because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling severe Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause appears to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, so sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany when vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to the Biontech boss, he has been vaccinated three times.
Samples from Syria are also said to have been brought there.

Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
The lights went out in several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless work," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those most recently affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood help.
"It is now important that the citizens take care of the elderly or single people in their neighborhood and notify the local fire department if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need medical devices that depend on electricity or who are dependent on medical care.

Fertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insured case"?
Hello everyone,
we were in fertility treatment for a while, now when it comes to billing with PKV, it suddenly gets in the way.
In turn:
We had applied for fertility treatment from the PKV in advance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle them with the PKV.
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more attempts than promised, logically we bill the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to refund 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the group here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that further attempts expire with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinion.
Thank you for your help!

"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in the long term, explained the researcher from the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in very little, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"Apparently, it can't assert itself when a member state gets it in its head to do its thing," as is currently the case in Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have tried again to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border.
The Polish officials were thrown stones by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU threw its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.

Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately I now have problems setting up a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrive on the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, but the further away I go in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here too.

When it's time to change checking accounts
Anyone who would have thought that the current accounts would be calm for the time being is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division - to EUR 50,000 for current and investment accounts and to EUR 25,000 for daily money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers."
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of EUR 50,000, which still applies, just like with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to EUR 50,000 and now to EUR 25,000.
After all: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which even got right against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 liters capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still allow access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: First, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags.
There is a metal hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, riveted stably, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional top access backpacks - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment with you, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if you head to Scotland in the autumn.

Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the properties of the original assembly when balancing the disc.
The tuned discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, sparking the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.

Coloma is set over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will be banned!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
The promoter rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players have to defend Coloma from an incursion of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We got into a hibernation and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many here are still really interested in the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and, to put it simply, found a heap of rubble.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community found themselves interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to once again expressly call on everyone to participate, this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that's not a bad thing, we end up with the Discord.
If you have the time and inclination, join the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.

Hence my decision to go vegan.

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar job, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
Basically, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, of course, people to the right of conservatives are magically attracted to people in particular in uniforms and weapons carriers, and that these people then naturally find it difficult to deal with the lived reality. Of course it is also clear, because in addition to the average white person, you now have many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine clichéd gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive branch, but completely normal men and women who you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also on these people I can and have to rely on them, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But these fringe groups also represent a conservative attitude, even if it sounds strange at first in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less taken up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks they are right to do, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since the police and armed forces are of course also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wing people there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing comrades meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!

A career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have now studied for about a year.
Unfortunately, I'm realizing more and more that this job is not the right one for me, which is why I've been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.

I have no problem talking to people on a matter-of-fact level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and have often been told that I seem unapproachable (although I think that's gotten better).

The ÄVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("still screwed up the simplest things") and I find it difficult for more experienced colleagues to ask for help ("I should really know how to do it myself by now"/"I keep him from work with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really poor" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it at the time.

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything you can think about.
Before I go into detail here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm doing the ref right now as a career changer.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't name anything more precise here).
But then the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up becoming a teacher and I was sure that was it - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
The times before that I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can still switch.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time over the past month that I'm completely drained.
It's vacation time now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my end of work was my end of work.
I was free then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically it's fun and from the outside the ref is also doing well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can handle before it shuts down completely - if it's not already doing so.
I'm wondering if I want it to be like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I'm reading some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was valued, take my free time when I needed it, and although I found the work kind of boring, I was paid appropriately for it and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if in a year I won't have come back to the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You notice that everything is kind of confused, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.

Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amp.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers come up with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply get the tonal variations and nuances of a tube amp better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and twist historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amp: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amp in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and based on this finding developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuitry of each VT+ amp perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amp.

Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models in the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.

Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.

Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new promontories with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly badly affected, about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País."

Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and the children in particular will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling excitement, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving gifts, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be brought back to life in the context of this tradition.
How Santa Claus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days to giving presents.
Before that, gifts of one kind or another were presented to each other on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into three women's windows in one night in order to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving presents gave rise to the custom, which is popular in Germany, of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected mediators between God and men as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they are keeping themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so narrowly, only very few are annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like the Martin custom with Martinssingen and Martin parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving presents shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy Kuddelmuddel about the question of who is now bringing the children the presents.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the three kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

"Smart Stone," on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different shades).

Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to hold its own thanks to its size.

Place the "light stone" in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.

The matte white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.

When dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; you decide in which color: you have a choice of six attractive light colors - in addition to daylight white.
Finally, switching off is also automatic as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.

Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been at the Ref since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me every hour actually stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I actually always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I'm rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.

The trade fears for the Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Most shops are only allowed to those who have been vaccinated or have recovered.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized the drop in sales when dealing with items that are not needed every day.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the rest of the year negatively.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G when shopping does not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, every customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the ribbon they received that day.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Recently, without 2G, frequencies were a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, and sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will surely fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa

The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas with a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working both on the film set and in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the lamp to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the lamp is installed in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would have new offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but where an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in high tones.
This is common with widebands in order to optimize the bundling, which increases sharply at high frequencies.
Directed precisely at the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and the sound pattern can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening follows in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
This opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer on the back in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM have an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto these.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store, for example, instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable circular hole saw or a Forstner drill bit makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connection terminal on the rear wall.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The base plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
You slide the entire and unabridged cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it protrude there for about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and also allowed to hang out loosely there.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed on, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and thus close it.
The seal can be checked through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed tight with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
