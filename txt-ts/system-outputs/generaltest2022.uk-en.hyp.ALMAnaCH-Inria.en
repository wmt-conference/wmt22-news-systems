Zelensky: Mariupol – the heart of war, stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that fighting for the East of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of war – and if the Armed Forces defeat there, Russians can leave negotiations and again occupy deoccupied territories.
Direct language: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It is fighting – we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting – we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city – editor) – people who pulled on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the eastern state, in the (area) ECO, and if they are stronger, then the table of talks will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we can not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will do all these steps, which can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now deokuped.
They can go to it.
Then our situation in talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we say.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that you are difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose opportunities for diplomatic solutions if they are in us."
Direct language: "People will perceive peace in any case because people want this war to end.
On our terms, conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family lost something – and I do not think they will satisfy any peace under any conditions.
But if we say not emotionally, the war must end with peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where millions of victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people."

Bubble is great, I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by news about animals of destruction from the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photos of rolled and shot people destroyed the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how could they happen in the 21st century?! How?!
Nothing surprised me at all. It happens exactly what I was waiting for...
I brought children and elderly parents from Kiev for the second day of war.
Then girls-college with children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently assisted the Armed Forces and has not been doubted for a moment that in the event of occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv my family will not be lucky.
Because I was and remained absolutely confident that the essence of the oppressed Communist-KDBest regime remained unchanged since 1918.
Without a terror, it can not exist, it is built on a terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in Zhytomyr prison.
A few years ago in the Yetomir SBU gave a copy of the shooting affairs of the grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence for the strat is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was unwritten, the guilt was denied.
Ethnic polish, Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-double" nobility, never walked in the cracks.
The fact that they lived on furs and had several measles was sufficient to admit the fucker and feeder of young children to destruction.
Parents did not even learn about the place of burial.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people took from the village then and killed all other than two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the karna case there is a surname of the pounding Share.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from the neighbouring village.
I believe in genetics and do not surprise if his relative was KDBest informator.
Apple from apple near, as you know, falls...
The shooting track, which was admitted to the stratu of peasants, was ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of grandfather, was interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) informational resources for "Bessmert barracks", which qualitatively remind about the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVDist found ways to punish and destroy almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin reprisals and publicly wrote the names of the killer – the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
As if on the computer they found files with children's pornography, she was planted in prison, and there was already rapidly died.
KDBest and now kill those who are trying to learn the truth about the crime of the last century.
What suddenly do you surprise their actions now?!
There is concentrated the most fraudulent features of human nature.
On the surface of the millennium ordinary tradition slavery imperial chovenism of the 16-19th century.
And then, what happened, did animal genetic experiment, cutting the intelligence during several waves of red terror.
See the semi-French film "Checkest" of 1992, so everything was.
Zoo you saw my photo at the swimsuit

So do you leave the city for a long time?
Seven years ago at the Memorial Center of the Holocaust "Babin Yar" in Kyiv, we honoured 80 years of mass shot by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babyn Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the German President.
He spoke about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
This basis we must protect is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new clothes," he said, "that for us, Germans, can only be one answer: never more!
The fight should continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, famined by the famine of the inhabitants of its blocked cities and gives them death from the disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shots of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles shots in Babyna Yar.
Over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Thus, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which has not long been impossible to imagine.
Germany detracts the delivery of heavy weapons required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose svastics.
This means combating all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that occur in Ukraine.

Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO ceased to be a far-reaching perspective
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO accession and only 18% of the respondents were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, Viktor Yanukovych escapes, annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbass war, the number of NATO enemies began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grow.
After the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and NATO's assistance under the conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism on the Alliance's account and country members - for the immediate supply of weapons, the refusal to close heaven, the unwillingness to save Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse to join the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the podcast "Kate Question" together with the editor of the "European Truth" we talk about how Ukraine has helped the Alliance since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our perspective of NATO membership is close, as never in history and why security guarantees discussed in talks with Russia can become the second Budapest memorandum.

Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes in Kiev: they say "not previously done so"
Direct language Konashenko: "We are trying to sabotage and attack Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases last, the Russian armed forces will strike the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army was previously held."
Russians launched missile attacks on Kyiv since the first days of full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of the Russian missiles that were killed by the Ukrainian system of PPO fell on a multi-apartment house on the capital Poznyaky.
On February 26, the Russian missile hit a multi-storey at Valeriy Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV on Drohozhichi near Babyny Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passengers.
On March 2, the Ukrainian PPO systems killed Russian missiles over the South Railway Station, flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defence building.
March 14, the fractions of the waged missiles of occupants split the house and trolleybuses in Kurinovka in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian missile invaded the residential array in Vinogradar, from which one person died, another 19 people were wounded, in particular four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed modern Retroville shopping center in Vinogradar, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said on April 13, that the inhabitants of the capital who evacuated from the city are still back in advance.
The military explained to the local authorities that Russians can still attack Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and uninterrupted ammunition on the neighbourhoods of the capital.
The head of the Ministry of Defence Intelligence warned on April 12 that Russians plan to primarily a number of attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and to justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
April 1 near Belgorod in Russia exploded the oil base, allegedly due to the air attack of Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod stated that near the city allegedly fell "Ukrainian shell".
It is obvious that the elite in Washington, in Berlin, throws into cold go from the very opinion that Natov fighters will kill Russian bombers in heaven in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and society in general.
His speeches in parliaments and before multi-thousand crowds on the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he will convince the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, these are a sophisticated alloy of power, touching times of starting, gradually reach their goal.
While Baden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his co-citizens already support this idea.

The head of the Office of President Andriy Yermak reported that Russia starts a "fix operation" regarding the weapons that allies transmit to us.
The direct language of Jermaka: "They understand that they lose war, see their backwardness and seek to "beat" the supply of arms with any methods.
For example, one of the last fakes is a busy destruction transmitted by Slovakia ZRK S-300.
This information was already denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will be further? We know the Russian scripts. Name one of them.
They can launch a fiction that Ukrainian soldiers seem to be with weapons from allies, and it massively shifts to the army of the Russian army.
I want to warn such fixes immediately.
For the arms in the hands of the warriors of the Armed Forces only send the enemy to the world.

The international community continues to express shock and disturbance after the appearance of evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected this message as a "provocation".
“Notes about the killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation,” said New Zealand Prime Minister Jassend Ardern to journalists in Willington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Caseda called the incident "violation of international law".
Statements were made after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and rescued in brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the district after the occupation for several weeks.
Photographs on which allegedly depicted bodies of worshipped civilians with connected hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
President of France Emmaniel Macron declared in the radio on April 4, which is a sign that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
“This happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sanchez stated that Russian troops could go so far that they made "genocides" in Bucha.
“We will do our utmost to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes are not punishable,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3, the anniversary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Maria Zakharova rejected the accusation as "provocation".
She stated without proof that the United States and NATO "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, I think, the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubt about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Previously, the Defense Ministry of Russia also stated without evidence that the image of Buche is "another placement of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city until March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia published a statement declaring "investigation" on charges of disseminating "knownly false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of the “genocide” in the city, and told the leaders of the Kremlin that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are executed,” Zelensky said in a video call, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For this murder, for this torture... for the shots in the bed," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with hands connected to the back and headless, I do not understand,” he said about the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Buche, cities about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Freedom on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city of the body like civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw on the street up to 10 bodies.
Journalists of the AP saw at least 21 people in different places of Buche.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in civilian – were scattered on the ground near the place, which, according to local residents, used Russian forces as a base.
Similarly, victims were killed at close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the district of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, "Kyiv is not." As occupiers under exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
This list contains another item, which is currently much less information – exports of the local population to the enemy.
Approximately since mid-March, Russian occupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements in their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military field.
"Ukrainian truth" found exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" itself takes place and whether there is a way to return after it to Ukraine.
Heroes of this text came to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and without evasion.
Fortunately, they live and maintain relationship with their natives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were exported to Russia and Belarus under strict force.
So in Melitopol the Russians stole the personnel of the second patient house, taken from there children without parents, among whom 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marin and their 10-year-old daughter Vale moved to Hostomil several months before the war.
Alexander himself received work at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plates, Denis and Marina gathered anxiety scales in advance, but in the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their car, and suburban buses had no more.
Approximately at the 12th hour of the 24th of February, they saw a helicopter with Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them involved in a nearby house.
Then the family descended into the basement and remained there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
Only 40 people were hidden in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"On the 6th evening, on February 24, people who spoke not in Russian, and not in Ukrainian came to the entrance.
They ask, "It's who?" - I'm saying what's going on.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, whether there was weapons.
All men asked whether they served in the army.
They said to women, "We have come to defend you according to Ramzan Kadyrov's instruction."
It was a Chechen UMON, not even troops, young guys for 25-35 years.
They said, "We helped the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Bel (managed the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement Viking, fighting on the Chechen side in the first Russian-Czech war – UP), now we will help you come."
On the third day they asked what we lacked.
We say that water, with it was a great problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the drive "all the same Russian will take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are also videos on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought sausages after the robbery of the store and say, "We understand that it is wrong, but we need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one especially wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says there: "You have 7 days to give our phones" - they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from Russians.
They said, as well as that they came, because they didn't want, Ukrainians supported and at all good: "Putin is an outfit, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mainly they didn't fight, but they robbed the store, marodered.
Chickens brought themselves, one tied to one leg of the Georgian ribbon, and the other – their white tape and called her "child".
They came to Ukraine at all unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were killed in Bucha, so they didn't even killed, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
Moreover, we had constructed units – Chechens did not know each other, in the first days asked passwords to detect, their own or otherwise.
They were in us until March 13, then arrived by the Russian Armed Forces, and followed by them by the Omsk landlord.
They supplied 30-40 units of equipment between houses – ours constantly entered it from "Baracters".
But this came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exist, but there are "Azov", and, in their words, "Azov" is so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
Narativ "Kyiv has already seen" has been progressing since the beginning of March.
Sometimes Russians came to us – either a landlord officer, or a representative of the FSB – and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Buch, Hostomel, thought, maybe we "green corridor" gave us.
From the very beginning we transferred our lists to Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we say, "You are exported to Belarus, and then perhaps to Rostov."
We say that we don't want to do it, not there.
What they said, "You will regret the psychology of your children!"
As it worked: they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house – either "Cradles" or mortars.
And then arrived back... Neighboring houses just burned, some of them fell.
In our house there was a direct impression on the third floor.
Later they agreed to bring us to Belarus only by promising to pass on to border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying that it was for betrayers of the homeland – he said, "you are shot there, they will sell to the authorities."
We were lucky through Chernobyl, on both sides of the roads were bursts, broken techniques, although Belarus told that Russian equipment was immediately exported to them.
A lot of captains, digged equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian "Komar" crossing point, we have undergone improved control, many were undocumented because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, gave tea.
And here we hear shots! Shoots the missile, and you can see the trace – it worked "Escander" in Kiev.
Although this from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these aircraft fly, deploy on the border."
But we from the aviation, we have education, we understand that it is.
Then we were loaded to the bus and carried to the sanatorium "Chonk" near Gomel.
His head, Vinger Vasyl Stepanovich, came, saying, "I am here, I am with Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these are your horns.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He will say and be."
They offered an interview with Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The administration of the sanatorium told us, "You are already traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and UN representations (at least they were called) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed in it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we so decided to leave, although they had a problem with documents – the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian Consulate we did not help anything, but in Minsk at the train station said that no one will take anyone in the bus without passports.
Here I will say that we were very helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium did not hold power.
Our second group migration representative said you can live for a maximum of a week and a half here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who voted to bring us to Warsaw.
Going near Mozyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw launching ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first flies, beautifully shines, and then shines.
People sitting on a bus in Mozir told that the Russians were constantly shooting from the fields there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight completely.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she broke something son if they called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus where Minsk does not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not understand that their fields are used to fire Ukraine.
Poland was waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we will be registered, decide what we will do further.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags now, certain, as much as Estonian."
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Hostomil together with his brother's family – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and, in principle, will not be able – the house is no longer.
Nobody knew nothing about evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the center will not be able to?
Thank you, we all have.And guests are always waiting for you!

Can you agree how best to do it?
On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk announced a joyful report – the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupants threw away from all the Kiev region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should feel at this moment was blurred by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that only in Buche the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed simply on the street, some bonded their hands and shot in the bed, part of the murdered – minors.
The murderers and traces of torture found the mayor of the village Motichyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and the son of Alexander, who were stolen on March 23.
Body Olga and Alexander were in a brotherly grave, Igor – in sewerage.
Bondage routes for 20 km from Kyiv revealed the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in the blanket.
Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
"All equipment, all they already send, for some types of equipment this is done late.
So what, when we, for example, talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what is now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries.
And some European leaders have changed the position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
On the question of this, Ukraine received enough weapons to make a difference in war, the President replied, "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, it would not be, or it would have a different look.
"It would otherwise deploy, we would have a shoulder of close neighbours, we could fight together.
But it's sure that he wouldn't do so," he added.
We remind the Prime Minister of Great Britain that Ukraine promised new military assistance, including armored equipment and anti-shipment weapons.

"I tell her that "renovation of the TV and radio receiver" was delayed through imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to swallow extra when they call."
"This month we hide from the candle of the infusion about the war.
So far it is possible.
However, the flames (cat – UP) on the bubble and rear paws raised fur – this can be from stress, feed changes and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons to eliminate, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The flame, unlike the candlestick, is not deaf, hears both siren and explosion."
Due to the fact that Olga badly hears and spends most of the time in her room, her bride month lived in an apartment with her "inkogneto".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took weapons for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and what I advised was formally coming as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend talked, I gave her the receiver – she listened to 4 hours, then she sang 2 hours."
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time candlestick spends in its room.
He hears badly – it allowed me to be invisible for her.
If I heard the sound of her "hookers", she hid in her room.
First of all, she hid from her receiver and TV.
Then he called all those who communicate with her. It is 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk about anything, not about war.
I ask my girlfriend, she was there from the very beginning to the end

We did not have food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon end."
Details: Islen served in the 36th separate marine infantry brigade of the Armed Forces, which participates in the defence operations of Mariupol.
The military journalists contacted the mother of the soldier In Wood, and she confirmed that her son reported on her phone that they were planning to settle in captivity.
The second military Brinnan Philips also confirmed to journalists that in the last telephone conversation Aslin said about the plans of their capitulation unit.
According to him, the brigade ended with ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Islina's units intend to seem captive of Russian units so as not to get without weapons ball to the hands of the so-called "cadirovs".
Also in social networks distributed audio recording of a telephone conversation, at which allegedly Islin talks to his friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Islin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they could not.
Earlier, the British told him that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of a private military company "Wagner".
Islin was a social employee in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in fighting against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic state" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the battle of the Armed Forces and sweared.

You have a tradition very interesting, we go so on Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a legislative draft 7176, which is called "To monitor potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy was... the place at which members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks meet.
Initiators of the draft law believe that decision-making by the Supervisory Board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new hazards to state companies, but is not yet aware of any company in which there was a need to physically meet the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law was understood – it is a wonderful basis to "climb" all the achievements in the heavy reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory councils, and then establish manual management.
Those that were before 2015.
Why state companies supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans "fly" one harmful draft law, then tomorrow others can fly – for example, it is possible to destroy the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of NBU.
Many can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this norm was introduced to the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory councils in a different way circulates among some people's defenders for a long time.
Not for criticism as such, but in order to show possible consequences of the draft law, we will consider the arguments explained by the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our proposals how to solve the issue of governance of state enterprises during the war.
Denis Kuden, First Deputy Minister of Economy, explained the need for such innovation to risks of Internet loss and other means of communication, which prevents remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the Supervisory Board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the company can be paralysed.
Do we agree that such a risk is, however, will he be able to prevent the movement of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Let's imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (which become most of the entire composition) will supply their personal security higher for the company's interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of quorum, the necessary supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, the new independent members of the Supervisory Board will not be appointed quickly, since the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3-4 months.
So proposed by the draft law 7176 decisions will probably not be able to preserve from the loss of the supervisory board the opportunity to make decisions, and more likely to lead to this!
People's deputy, the author of the draft law Dmitry Nataliukh provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "Multi enterprises, in particular the defence and industrial complex (ODC), now need a roll" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom".
First, there are almost no state enterprises in Ukraine, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in "Ukroboronprom", which in fact manages almost all state enterprises of the OPC.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the Director-General, who by the way will decide on the need for the placement of a enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the group.
In addition, this argument does not withstand the criticism because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of state enterprises of the OPC at all.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state companies and state banks, but let us try to understand some of them: "Convincing foreign experts with the first word "war", still in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards in state enterprises of Ukraine with full salary of several hundred thousand UAH, while Ukraine itself really suffers from war."
First, this manipulation – most of these members of the Supervisory Boards never lived in Ukraine and only periodically arrived here.
Therefore, it says that they "leave Ukraine" softly, unjustly.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory boards have long been resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool is long common in world practice, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
Do not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and just electronic means help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interesting why Mr. Dmitry does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards that are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from the supervisory councils, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of Kyiv regions, which were exempted from occupiers, will introduce a strengthened curfew for 2 days.
Direct language of Pavliuk: "In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts under the Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian Defence Forces, the curfew is strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages the restrictions will be valid from 21:00 on April 2 to 6:00 on April 5".
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is categorically prohibited to be on the streets of settlements and other public places, to move by transport and foot.
Bags can go on the street only during anxiety signal to go to shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of the Russian aggression – clean and deplete the territory.
Omelanik called on people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
On the rest of Kyiv region the curfew will last every day from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a word translated into the word from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom added an explanation that is an incaso.
I already have an account. I did in another bank. Because I had to have an account to work.
The Serbian defence budget for several years in a row grew in geometric progress.
Overall, over the past six years Serbia invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, upgrading military equipment and acquisition of modern systems, raising 22 seats on the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries have seriously perceived the assumption of possible exacerbation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

If you are in the Czech Republic without driving rights - you are forbidden to control the car.
Other frequent questions about driver's rights:

However, if you are in the Czech Republic for more than one year, you should exchange it in the municipality for a Czech driver's certificate.
The term of action of the driver's rights ended, what to do with this?
• The validity of which ended after 1.1.2022 - remains valid.
• The validity period ended until 1.1.2022 - is invalid, and you must pass an exam,
I have a true Ukrainian driver's certificate and I want to exchange it in Czech:
• stay in the Czech Republic at least 185 days in the calendar year.
• it is possible to replace it in the municipality according to the place of residence.
I don't have a valid driver's certificate and I want Czech:

Lukashenko's forces detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years, resulting in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation under Osipovich, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Vasna", Head of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennadiy Kazakevich, who quotes the state information agency "BelTA"
In the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Belarus reported that three inhabitants of Bobruska were detained on the night of March 30 with the military support of special appointments "SOBR" and one was wounded.
According to "Vasny", while detaining, men performed an active resistance and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was wounded and stayed in a medical institution.
Another one was provided with medical assistance on the spot.
The Chief of the Criminal Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennadiy Kazakevich stated that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the RB will be strictly terminated" by the forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, a staff member of the Baranovic branch "BJD" and an administrator of thematic resources "BJD" in "VKontaktia and "Odnoklasniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in which he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 trainers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, announced by the Lukashenko regime as extremities, continues to call on Belarus to carry out sabotage on railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "river guerrillas" thus try to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus the Russian Federation throws to fight, to Ukraine live power and equipment.

USA prohibit investment in Russia and impose sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, introduce new sanctions against the daughters of the Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution of Russia owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and prohibit US citizens from conducting business with them.
In addition, the state will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Baden will sign a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia to US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on decisions adopted by more than 600 transnational companies on withdrawal from Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms,” says the White House statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be published next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of minors Putin, wifes and daughters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including with the expedition and Prime Minister of Russia Dmetry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions disable them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.

The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna published a video recording in the morning on April 12, which was handed over to the 36th marine infantry brigade from Mariupol.
The military say that they have not left weapons to participate in battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said that "account goes for an hour".
Before that, on April 11, 36th separate marine infantry brigade, which participates in the defence of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11 could become the last fight for defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepsis that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that the communication of the command with the defence forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defence operation should not be subject to public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers in the territory of the plant "Azovstal" in Mariupol to use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped the poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of "Azov" Andriy Beletskyi, the Russian Army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which are held by policemen of the regiment "Azov".

In order to maximize the effective use of coppers - the place of their deployment is now secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic in the done stop are not planned, say: in the coming days to Ukraine will send a lot of interesting “gifts” that will serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.

In Kherson, the occupants departed from the memorial "Slava Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopsk street.
Details: It is noted that unknown disruptions of the flag of the European Union have triggered the panels with photographs of Heavenly Hundreds and dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants destroyed the portrait of the characters of the Heavenly Hundred and the killed participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took the flag.

Headquarters: Russia is preparing provocations in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine "in aggression against the neighbouring state".
It is not excluded from conducting provocative actions by the Russian Federation in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with a view to accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state.
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobozhanski direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupants will try to restore the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities in Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
Perhaps these weapons will be moved to temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also to restore the loss of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group composed of the 36th separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Borza, Zabakal region) 29 general military army of the Eastern Military District is recruited from the said brigade.
The special problem of the enemy is felt when the positions of drivers and driver mechanics are completed.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the enemy to violate the supply of cargo to hostilities will continue to strike on transport infrastructure facilities in Ukraine with a view to destroying them or withdrawing them from failure.
Definitive units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarus border in Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th general army and coastal troops of the northern fleet continue partial blocking of the city of Kharkiv, continue artillery shelling of individual districts of the city.
In the Isim direction, the air intelligence of the area continues to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses BPLA "Orlan-10".
The forces of up to two battalion tactical groups of enemies tried to offensive in the directions of settlements Dovgenka and Dmytrovka, success was not and went to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of settlements Popasna, Rubežna, Lower and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out an assault in the Golden area, he had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, occupants continue to act as an assault in the areas of the plant "Azovstal" and the seaport.
The forces of individual units of the enemy carried out artillery shelling positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysopil, Trudolibivka and Mariansky.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, four enemy attacks have been destroyed by defenders of Ukraine last day, five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to accomplish, but I doubt

Hello, we've got things you brought, but there are things that little one can bring them to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about the work.
If Mr. Director arranges, I can start working from next week because tomorrow to lunch I plan to go to the labor bureau to submit documents (if they get, because very big queues) and on Saturday rain :)
Looking for a brigade at the beginning, very liked at school chemistry, I learn Czech to perfectly know, dreams of working on Teva
Friends are not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now, too, hard times came to you.
During the last month I communicated with many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned from the feet to the head, as well as every Ukrainian life.
Many of you run from Russia.
And many of you have acknowledged that they feel guilty and shame because of your country's actions towards your neighbours.
Because of why Ukraine is subjected to your name.
Some of you, activists, have long hanged the threat, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote Alexander Cherkassy, my very ancient friend from the Memorial.
Let's tell a little later, – as usual, Sasha laconically replied. – Now, after searching, we go on ruins.
Others – artists, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let us be frank: except for a few of you – those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medus, the Naval Organization and in a number of other places – did many of you do at least something to resist this regime?
Besides participating in the rally when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Let's hide, late silence"
And if so, you are sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive participation, which are now probably a great burden on your heart?
So it wasn't always.
In the 1990s was a short period when you have to some extent freedom and democracy – even a curve, but a real one.
But 1991 was not the best in 1917.
Why every time you finally have a revolution, will you eventually cover such a strong fear of sadness that you are looking for salvation behind the back of the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
How many people he did not kill, you still seem to be safer at him. Why?
Indeed, mistakes were admitted.
Instead of capturing the publication of the KDB archives, as the Germans have done with happiness, you have left the soul on the monument of Dzerzhinsky – and allowed the KDB to lay down, update, reform and capture power over the country.
When you were put before choosing between the robbery of the country and the return of communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option – and pokerly reconciled with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and it marked the end of mass protests for great social justice or against it in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Little of you bought it, but you still voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya again with the earth, most of you put on this eye.
I remember well those years.
I worked in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kal and other cities.
Sometimes in the weekend I returned to Moscow and fun with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of peaceful inhabitants, the killed children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we have already bored your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
I answered, "Friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, horror takes away, not my.
I'm just a foolish foreigner here.
This is your power to bomb one of your cities, kills your co-citizens."
But not, it was too difficult, too painful, and you did not want to know anything.
Then there was an economic rise in the middle of zero, due to the growing oil prices and Putin's readiness to watch through his fingers that part of the stolen money will remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you began to earn good, some rich, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices rose, are you wrong?
Moscow festively shined and foxed from the chic.
When several opponents – Yuriy Shchekochin, Anna Politkovska, Alexander Litvinenko and others – were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what happened.
However, the case did not go further.
When after two deadlines Putin transferred the post to President Medvedev, and the premiere itself took place, you, as I see, almost drew this attention.
When after a few months of the Medvedev government Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or destroyed it.
How many of you have met in the coming years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the suburbs of Kazbeg or in the cafe and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, until part of this country was occupied by your army?
I should recognize that we were unlikely to do much in the West if they did anything at all.
A bit of frustration, a bit of sanctions; but what is the importance that Russia is crucially violating international law, when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again changed places with Medvedev and sowed a presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was already too, and you were massively opposed.
The Name of Naval has become responsive, you did not go from the streets for a half year, and the regime eventually felt horror that losing the ground under the legs.
After that he striked in response.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind the game.
Some got huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I heard it so often and I hear so far.
"The state is so strong, and we are also weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Awakened by the pro-Russian president, who praised their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan – and never left him.
They completely independently led the tent town and prepared for decisive defence.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend with fingers, reinforcements and cocktails of Molotov.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of flying, protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fleece became Yanukovych, and Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and to expel them if they badly do their business.
The maidan did not like Putin.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, using the general summits, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against, but there was little benefit from this.
And how many of you were delighted!
As I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported annexation.
Somewhere suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who denied Putin and his shake suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to love him.
I'm hard to find the reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mainly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you were hidden in books, cinemas, ICEA catalogue and parks as new after the restoration started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 – with their benbegs, a public bath and a hipster cafe.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so good – and it becomes only better.
You almost drew attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor, who released my book about Syria, criticized it then in an interview, because I did not understand anything else in Syria.
Well, at least, I rided there and saw himself how the state snipers cold blood shoot in the streets of Homs in my children.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who began bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of pastor Martin Nemeller:
"They first came to socialists, but I declared – because I am not socialist.
Then they came to the members of trade unions, but I declared – because I am not a member of trade unions.
Then they came to Jews, but I declared – for I am not a Jew.
Then they came to me, but no one else could say to my defence."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the majority declined.
Some really speak now – such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zigar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most allows you to speak from abroad, some – from the middle of the country like Marina Ovsannekova, risking to enter a new GULAG or make a company Navalnoe.
As for others, you are best known in which country you live.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin understands the Ukrainians – or that seems to be very likely if he does not have it – he will take for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone protested and still took place in a small term, but will soon get more serious.
Thousands of you who signed a petition who expressed disagreement in social networks (although even deprived of a black square in Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Time when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty was given simply for anecdotes, remained not in such a far past – and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you? Who will remain?
Examples of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – fall in love with Putin’s regime: they prove that they can fight with them.
And that the mind, motivation and courage can stop it, whatever its advantage was wicked on paper.
Due to everything, few in Russia this realizes, as well as what is generally going on war.
But you, my friends, know well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with which you maintain communication.
And Putin knows you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what everything goes to.
Beautiful life in exchange for your silence has reached the end.
Your choice is just a hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account repressive ones, worth not more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media no longer, your economy is destroyed faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket for aircraft abroad, even if some flights remain.
Now Putin will not satisfy your silence, he will require your consent, your pokerness.
And if you do not give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or disappoint you.
I doubt you see another option.
And yet it remains another.
How to finally break this regime.
And perhaps in conditions that have emerged, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark does not burn from you: due to the economic collapse imposed on Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly, and wages will not be paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace to go on the street.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the meeting itself, as it has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool – the Internet that mode can limit, but how still works and how you can set up in almost any circumstances.
The Naval Organization was destroyed, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're a million.
Moscow police can cope with 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300 thousand goes, it will be stunned.
Will you have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to work?
After all, why did he force them in Ukraine, all because he forced them to pass?
Of course, the danger will be very big.
Many of you will feel fearful; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would also be afraid of your place.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who prefer to neglect their owner, who prefers not only to demand freedom, but also really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the life of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will destroy the joke in the chat of the computer game – and will be arrested; your daughter will destroy the internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will assume mistakes – and will die in the raw chamber under the police duplicates.
That's what has happened for many years – and will only be further strengthened, acquiring more and more scales.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know what it will end.
Children are cold, think strategically and achieve it to become a reality.
We were on Friday, we told that we could come on Monday
In the evening we will be at home
