Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult time of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 30-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the AC and could soon reach the goal as well.
Former goalkeeper Litvínov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game with Vegas, he has changed and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when an experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out of approximately three to four weeks with lower-body injuries," said the Denver unit at the beginning of October.
His return to goaltending in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, the American time was called out of the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The student of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year, he had hip problems and did not catch a single match in the short pandemic year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, its success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a veil on Camille on a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as a Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo on which Camille will take her on the races to help put on a veil.
The British news station BBC reported on this on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, it is not even clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile in her country house in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
Prince Charles and his wife Camilla also published a Christmas card image.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who has a top hat and a veil on his head, helps Camille put on her veil color-coordinated with the bright dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for her title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with Roman Berbr, the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, to have been promised a million crowns from Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018 / 19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got to a part of the police files.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that no corrupt behavior was possible.
The server published a transcript of the police wiretapping in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, figures mainly.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for gaining the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) from SK Slavia Praha officials should have a million bribe to win in the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminal investigators, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdík, the chairman of the board.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal negotiations, we have never sought to affect referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context, "Tvrdík said for the Zpravy list.
Nezmar will insult some former dark-skinned Slavia players in wiretapping, among other things, and he will also avenge his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through arbitral tribunals was sparked last year by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like Vyšehrad's former sports director, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but in principle of a worse type (gunners must take cartridges from the armored cabin and carry cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, it was possible to get rid of Praga V3S even for specialized units.
Planes: Combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
PVO: Central - cold, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
A technically perfect mess with a weak script. The Gemini with Will Smith did not deteriorate criticism
The dystopian science fiction Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will make his younger version of the film. However, according to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be viewed in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute top in his field. He is killed effectively and without unnecessary questions. But one day, he decides to hang his career on a nail. Understandably, he doesn't like his employers, who send another killer on Henry. The catch is that Henry himself, more specifically his younger DNA clone. Can one determined person win the fight against himself? This time, is this the killer?
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee should have been a sure guarantee of quality. Although this is his first science fiction, he has extensive experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and Dragon or western Riding with the Devil. However, the script collaborated with six hundred. The most famous one is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones, according to the first reviews, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Although Ang Lee is trying to make big things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan from Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved in it. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," summed up his opinion Stephen Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
"The Gemini is the case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly uniform action film," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"The confused product arose with a bizarre idea," summed up the film in her review by Ella Kemptová from the IndiaWire website.
"It's hard to care that one man is the other's two-man if neither is acting like a person," wrote Nicholas Barber from The Wrap.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
They were climbing nutrients from the river and damaging the crops, so I sat there.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I hoped to leave before anything came to light, but, of course, in a while a fox went.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost laughed, he was head-on to all sides, so I called to him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of my seat there was a mess.
I.e. even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, that would have to be a interplay of many coincidences to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal image that almost everyone has today.
So to a visible place, put expensive things at your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be cool.

Respirators found themselves significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy an auction?

An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature-length documentary by Olga Špátová
This unique film from the workshop Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me, and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life again with Karel after ten years of age. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a person who lasted more than half a century in the forefront of Czech culture thanks to my exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable hard work, it was and is for great honor. I dare to accept Karl Gott's commitment to this feature-length documentary film, which I'm already happy with this legendary singer Olga Špátová describes as a commitment to three generations of listeners."
Thanks to a quick agreement and an agreement, the first filming day took place already on October 22 last year and the last footage with Karel Gott was filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is completely clear - to capture the authentic Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer, who is distributed to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time to the same time a loving husband and father of his children. Who for sixty years is handing over with her songs to her joy for several generations, not only in us in Europe, but also in the hearts of listeners and listeners around the world.
The film should not be a parade of the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film Phenomén Gott to this current one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, this will very evident in his personal or intimate confession that he gave us and which confirmed to all of us in what legend we have the opportunity to work with for an indescribable time, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans here and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that she played in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's frank openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
And "Olga has a great gift to filming with her close team in such a way that we often let ourselves be carried away by a spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her go into our privacy, thanks for which I talked about topics relatively intimately. With my husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, they have actually become part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when she celebrated my life anniversary with me. But since I and my family had a beautiful summer together with my supporters, I wanted me to be accompanied by a documentary film for as long as possible next year's wish," says Karel Gott.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large stores of technology that could take up trained, we don't actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so the abilities of reservists will rapidly lose weight over time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists / territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can lead, and it is also a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in the conflict of such scale and intensity, where guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have the right geography for that.
Xxx Lutz may buy competitor Kika, the office has allowed. But it has a catch
"Under the condition of fulfilling the structural obligations established in favor of maintaining effective competition, the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition allowed the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other," said ÚOHS spokesman Martin Švanda.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, xLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores. If it were to absorb the Kika chain, it would occupy too much on the Czech market for furniture and accessories. That is why it must sell off part of the company purchased.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be approved by the Antimonopoly authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Signa chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. He took over Kiku failing last year at a nominal price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is a twin after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. This faced problems when it revealed irregularities in its accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
Xxx Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture sellers on the domestic market. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, Möbelix will already run over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about CZK).
Only children. We certainly don't have reproduction, but we don't have to worry
Some words have bad connotations, although they just convey the condition of the thing. These include the word only child growing up without siblings, but they have not become neutral. "You know, little children," they say, without needing anything to be added. It is interesting that you have not "carries this feature since recently, even since when expressions like demographic crisis have not been widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community already know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure simple reproduction. It is also widely known that no state achieves this value in Europe today. France or Sweden is at most close to it, but they do not have a simple rate of population reproduction ensured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with a totality of 3.1 children.) It is therefore an alarmism for two families. But when it comes to LN families, Maláčová said to him: "In an interview, the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Malá is no longer the only thing she can do with him," she said.
Yes, it's good if the problem is pointed out instead of trivialized or ideologized. For example, like in Germany, for example, where the campaign for more children easily gets a label of fad (in the style of "even Hitler supported it"). It's good if it's remembered that many couples only directly plan. It's good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (weak expansion of work from home discourage women from pregnancy), but let's point out one thing from another.
If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only children" there is a sprinkle of demagoguery in that. This statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let's remind you that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husákovy děti"). Then it dropped to 1.14 in 200. But since then, almost fifty percent of the current children have risen to an alarmism, so that's not enough for a woman, so that's what she can do with us.
Berlin is responding to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. It will buy 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (23.8 billion CZK) 6,000 former social apartments that the city sold 15 years ago. This is in response to the pressure of the public, which is rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left (Die Linke) party, this is the largest such buyout in the history of the capital of Germany. Criticizes the opposition.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new and legally treat the freezing of rents," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of apartments located in Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothausler, the city bought too much. He told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing units overpaid by roughly ten percent over their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation in their procedure. The FDP said this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money".
Even in mid-July, Gewobag got back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on his website. At that time, the council did not disclose the price. The dispute over apartments on the former GDR-era exhibition street was accompanied by protests and filled in front pages of the German press. He became a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, the newspaper wrote.
At the same time, the German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of life and low rents. However, it has gained attractiveness in recent years. According to AFP, rent prices have doubled over the past ten years, and so some residents are just difficult to find affordable housing.
Above all, we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act as if they had it.
Then this comes to pass such a situation that you watch a guy who didn't hit an empty net 2 minutes ago drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they vote for him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "trick" skill is so terrible that I'm honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent's players.
Swap of wives: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! He finished in the Constitution
It was nerve wracking. Allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "" He came from school and lied with his snack. Lukáš looked at me and said he would kneel behind me, "Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! In addition, off-camera, he allegedly had to suffer a wooden foot massage mat like this! Because he understood what I wanted to do behind me - so that I didn't want to go to the studio door, and that's why I didn't want to be here, because I't want to go to the studio door, because I'm finally understood what's happening behind the studio door," she said.
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from the family after filming and placed in the Educational Care Center in České Budějovice for a month. Although he briefly returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), he then went to the diagnostic institute for problem children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added to Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. Pilsen was most interested in whether we received the money, but then Lucie wrote to them that they didn't respond to them at all."
Of course, the flash also approached the other side, but he only got a vague reply. "I'm not in a mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta excused herself and hung up the phone.

The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1,038.45 points. It was pulled up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 or the technology company Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and media company ČME did not succeed. This follows from the results of trading on the website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and ended up concluding with a small profit. "However, it lost (PX index) slightly over the whole week," pointed out Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected declines from recent days. The commercial bank improved by 0.82 percent to 803 crowns and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to 72.80 CZK. Avast's shares rose by.89 percent to 113 crowns, and the operator O2 added 0.466 percent 2150 CZK.

The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, it will last for some time in hospitals, and, as we know, a new unknown has added to the pandemic equation: A omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the Covid equation this week: The possibility of treatment.
A new drug, an antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and it is possible to treat them at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports the success rate of 85 percent so far.
However, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools suitable for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic also highlighted the question of how the local administration is ready for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck's molnupiravir will first reach domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape, even because the drug began to developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find suitable treatment for viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how the beaks grew up to us".
See you do a research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you without circumstances that no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist beasts.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west looks good, the east seems bad.
But they will find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both, according to surveys, have over 20%.
The French Oscar candidate Les Miserables will start the Be2Can show
The Golden Bear and both winners of acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the direction award and jury award from Cannes and much more will present the 6th year of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and successful one they presented to the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Miserables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes festival. The film is a French Oscar candidate. The preview of the film in Prague will be personally presented by representatives of two main roles of police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis is also co-writer of the film.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art cinema), Ostrava (Mini cinema) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from October 2 to 8.
Ladj Lyho's feature-length directorial debut was shown and awarded at a number of other world festivals after its success in Cannes. At the Durban IFF, he won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award, as well as being shown at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo, and will soon be shown in San Sebastián.
However, as part of the festival, viewers can also look forward to the movies Synonymy, Young Ahmed, a System Inc., my son, sorry, sorry, sorry, we didn't ask you, Ghost Town Anthology and the film Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will fall in love with Czech distribution: Sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of the bird.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to study where what is happening again, all objects on the hair are the same.
Of the one, there is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want nuclear warheads to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either for reasons of safety or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads and rockets, as they say, were kept.
If it was necessary to put on this weapon, a special unit was arrived to pick up this head and mount it on some carrier device.
In addition, museum maples, are the rest in a desolate condition.
Babiš called for security cooperation in the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2019 in New York City.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced this today at the New York memorial to terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very touching place," said the Prime Minister when, accompanied by his wife Monika, he laid a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousk and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 killed by hijacked planes on the former twin towers of the World Trade Center (WTC). The towers collapsed after the impact, there is now a memorial to the names of the victims.
"It should be remembered what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The Prime Minister identified the attack on the US on September 11, 2001 as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. At that time, in addition to the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers, terrorists encountered hijacked planes into the Ministry of Defense building in Washington and planned to have another attack on the target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress will set up this plane when they resisted hijackers.
"That is our main enemy, where all countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," added the Czech Prime Minister.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate Gypsies, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but it was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often walked with him and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he went cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, other classes, entered the same year.
Shortly after that, there were often police dealing with something there, they threatened and threatened other students...
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn't try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called in a month that he had already transferred it to himself...
I myself say I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other as long as they act as they are in a decent society (works, works, women don't, just don't take normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he reaches out his hand, clears the apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn't matter what color he is, but will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start business, work with us, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care for as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will also respect their traditions and culture.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who carried the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for so far unknown reasons drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After a collision with Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle finished on the roof off the road, described the accident by South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and remained wedged in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice in a stable condition, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not supply data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive for him, newly he must add VAT and hand over the post office data for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officers are expecting the package to come.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT on sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not take care of the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkbox, put in two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Strict but just, we have fun for hours! So the Benedictine gymnasiums see their favorite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. At the same time, a high school teacher of Czech and history is a poet, novelist and revivalist of literary life in a small town.
Bohuslav Reynek springs to mind over the lyrics of Pavel Hoza. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, white country houses, trembling grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been going through them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor teaches Czech at the gymnasium in Benešov, literature and history in Prague's Café na slovčko organizes a similar Viola and organizes a literary festival every year.
Solving inflation
See the headline how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year they added me 2% in gross, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business they run at work.

The vote of the upper house of the Canadian parliament confirmed the rumor that has been known for several days: Canada has taken the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the fight for human rights, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years in house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title due to her role in genocide against the minority nation of Rohingya.
The decision to grant Suu Kyi honorary citizenship was agreed by the lower legislative body a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "It is the right message both for her and for Myanmar and for the whole world," commented independent senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that the accomplices of genocide are not welcome here in Canada - especially as honorary citizens.
The verdict of the Canadian parliament technically does not change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The long-time human rights campaigner's silence on atrocities that the army of Buddhist Buddhist Buddhist Myanmar has been perpetrating for endless months on the Muslim Rohingya minority has been intolerable.
The fact that an officially organized genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - de facto prime minister of its government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently revealed by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders, who, according to the investigative team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - shock both appalling nature of her actions and a huge scale ". For example, the Suu Kyi and her administration were complicit in covering up the actions of soldiers - for example, by covering up to the actions of soldiers and spreading lies -" says Suu Kyi.
After Suu Kyi's removal, five figures remain on Canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, " Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousafza.
Developments surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about atrocities against Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take her the title of honorary citizen was added to Suu Kyi's profile. "We have also dimmed the lighting of her photo on the human rights timeline and are thinking that we will replace the face with a portrait of a member of a Rohingya minority" Canadian media quoted McLeod museum spokesperson.
The only thing that will remain with Suu Kyi in the current up-to-date up-date upheavals - at least so far - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the fight for democracy. "Although Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are deplorable, her award will not be revoked," Nobel Foundation head Lars Heikensten told Canada's CBS.

The Supreme Prosecutor renewed the prosecution of the mother who manipulated the daughter against her father
Supreme Prosecutor Pavel Zeman does not agree with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disturbed her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering education. The regional court acquitted her of charges, that she disagrees with this. According to him, a criminal offense can be seen in a similar act to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a wider impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary even in terms of streamlining further application practice," Zeman's appeal states.
Last year, the district court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of abusing her trusted person and endangering the upbringing of a child. She formed a strong or symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she should have been entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship to the father. The situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to harm herself in the event of handing over to the father's care.
The Svitava court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquittaled the woman in the appeal process, saying it is not a criminal offense. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court ordered him to decide again.
The regional court stated that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are not exceptional. It is resolved in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the Supreme Prosecutor, the woman committed both torture and endangering her upbringing. "She performed completely targetedly when she caused negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and confirmed these negative emotions in a targeted manner. At the same time, she not only watched such actions the illicit intention to limit or exclude father's contact with minors, but she must have been necessarily aware that this will cause negative consequences for minors in the psychosocial sphere," says appeal.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court one more time. The appeal shows that the child is now in the care of his father.

Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don't understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his / her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and overall.
And not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
The first Miss Christová finally came together: She lost a few kilos and immediately looked through
Ivana Christová (49) had problems with overweight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but especially psychological ones. She suffered because she has changed a lot since Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took the criticisms to heart and went to battle with the extra pounds. Although it's a long-distance run
The former first-class beauty who also conquered Paris. But since then it has been thirty years before, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty competition. Not only because of her fame, but also because she was thin.
Over time, she decided not to obey the strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and started indulging in what she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. In addition, she tried to disguise the extra pounds with various loose clothing, but added dimension to her curvaceous shapes.
Now it seems that Ivana really went into her own. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and properly to her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone present at the launch of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75) that she looked through again and already has back the features of a charming brunette who entered history in 1989 not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also as the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first winner of beauty, but also the very first one, on which the viewers in the Palace of Culture and Sports in Ostrava whistled in terms of being stripped when she put on the crown.
The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed for a year
The Administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has moved the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date for opening the envelopes was September 20, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for postponement of the deadline for submission of offers is a reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that is acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," said Drahný.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the renovation of the museum has been delayed for about a year. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor of the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park, the European subsidy of 123 million crowns for the project is not at risk.
The KRNAP administration is unable to select a construction company for the repair of the museum. The second competition was launched this summer, because in the previous tender all offers of companies significantly exceeded the expected price of 65 million at the time. The offers exceeded 10 million crowns.
The museum, which is located in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should ensure the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor center should be created in the now cleared building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibits.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and follow on from the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway for visitors to the Giant Mountains. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most understandable form and motivate people to explore and protect the mountains. The center should also take over the role of a traditional museum. The center should also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theater performances or lectures under the open air in the construction of a new entrance to the building or cafe is a research room.
A man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob logically helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom a warrant for arrest was issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went wrong.
At first, he approached the passerby and made up for a story that he was robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted advice from the officers on how to submit a notification to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore resolved by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we have not been ethnically or culturally Slavic for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with my meme, a shame that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the US: ')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Unexplained death of a little girl (" 8) in Příbram region: The culprit does not expect punishment
The unexplained cases are called "monuments" in criminal slang. However, they are also under investigation if new information comes to light after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí at the time of 12 years old. "It will be difficult, very difficult, very difficult, but it would really want to find hope with those who have been talking to it.
Under the previous regime, however, it certainly does not mean that the public has much information about violent crimes, according to Markovič. "It always depends on specific people," thinks the criminalist. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, even though unclosed cases should not be joked.
Tech companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history grew somewhat. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism following the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may have seen... is the final point of humanity's ideological development and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governing."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather witnessing how, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, rather illiberal models are winning and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. He shows a rethinking interview by George Eaton for the New Statesman, he insists that many former critics of his former positions should still be right back in line with Marx's position in the nineties and that his thought development is still right back in line with Marx's thought development.
"What I have said at that time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it behind in individuals who feel alienated, they do not see a sense, and therefore group into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging.
And at that time, the book End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked about how the rise of socialists in Britain and the US now sees the rise of socialists, Fukuyama corresponds to: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about owning funds of production, except when clear services from the public are in demand, I think that this will no longer be an unreasonable effect on the market. But if I think that's why President Reagan and I'm trying to come back to an end in a disastrous way, then I think that it's going to an unreasonable way."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm down the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence only because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I can't agree to Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world if I don't drink, something about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods do you have to choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who punishes you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the tenth place, it is stated that there is no other god other than the one of Jesus.
So in such a case, wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing wrong of the thousands of gods, and the one real god that I just didn't punish will send me to hell or to a similar place for that?
Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has so far received six applications in this connection and is now analyzing them. The young man was in prison for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary finally acquittal him legally.
Neither the Supreme Prosecutor Pavel Zeman nor the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová filed an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec prosecutor's office charged a then 20-year-old student of the Nečesané grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took her over ten thousand crowns. Her son found her seriously injured woman, her life was saved by doctors of the hospital in Hradec Hradec Králové.
Uncombeded from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent and swear to it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the offender," said the young man earlier in court, who refused to deny that he was fateful day in the hair salon. He said he wanted to have been cut down. But he left after the woman told him that she is already closing. Himself then filed with the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor during the interrogation, but later Nečesané called him an attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court gradually handed down five judgments in the case. First, Nečesané recognized the Nečesané twice guilty and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 13 years. He gradually headed for bars twice, but each time after the intervention of the Supreme Court he was released. After the ordered replacement of the Supreme Court of the court, repeated acquittal judgments fell, while the court confirmed the one last March.
At the same time, however, in the justification of his conclusions, the chairman of the appeals panel, Jiří Lněnička, stated that this decision was wrong, but due to the procedural situation, he said he had no better option. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict, although its appeals were justified.
"The problem with this matter is not that there is a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the preliminary proceedings, which would be rich in other criminal matters for the recognition of guilt," said Lněnička.
But the Hradec Králové but also the Supreme Court looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change the further cancellation of the acquittal.
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in reserves.
I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry has been constantly floundered, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of blending, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, i.e. an institution that guarantees that Russia, a German or, for example, a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
He will come to me funny as you consider NATO to be something stone-cropped, we have allies, and they will therefore defend us if there is a pruser.
Well please, man.
Just one election in the US is enough to screw their budget and the whole NATO goes to a pick.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown once that they are enough to show their backs and will take what they want.
The only thing that has long been working as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.

KOVOSVIT sells an administrative building and other halls. It expects worse times
Last year, Kovosvit finished last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, a consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Kuchař ranks among the main last year's problems. This year, the demand for machine tools decreased, by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decline in turnover of ten percent," said the CEO. In 1177, KOVOS had sales of 13 million crowns and a tax loss of 4.9 million after 2019.
KOVOSVIT now offers for sale several properties, halls and plots that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where two of the five floors are used, and not completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit, make its operations more effective. The sale of assets is not any momentary solution, whether it is cash-flow, for example, part of a long-term plan, when we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
Roughly half of the production will be exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 10 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "Another order in the same volume is started, which we would like to fulfill by the end of 2017, he said.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May it was delivered by another machine, one more should be delivered at the end of the year or bankrupt in 2020.
The company's main investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. KOVOSVIT employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and armorer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. In 1939, it was founded by Tomáš Baťa. The company had up to three thousand employees at the time.

"When we made up the music for my father's words, we used his own distinctive musical techniques. So it's still with us," said Adam Cohen about the album. "The most amazes me about it are the reactions of those who have already heard him. One by one they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallows of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sang in his distinctive honey voice. He sang about death, suspected he would not live. He admitted this even in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before death. "I hope that's not very unpleasant, he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen on December 31 at Argo publishing house.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is full of boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That is why it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
After agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging that is currently in short supply on the market and also money saved, as packaging cardboard has become more expensive by 50% recently.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
However, the boxes and filling material will be brought to Popůvek u Brňské by individuals who accumulate at home, we are also contacted by companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything in the packaging of shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature to future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It is used as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take away sorted household waste, where to hand over expired drugs, tires, retired electronics, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
The total map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Managers of state-owned companies are supposed to newly go through selection procedures. The law will be circumvented, the opposition claims.
"This is a typical bill that is useless," said the chairman of the ODS parliamentary club Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the non-transparent distribution of functions - critics speak of newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, applicants should go through a selection process at the given ministry and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because they allegedly allow ministers to excuse themselves for any bad selection of state managers, the selection committee may. In addition, the opinion of the mentioned committee for the minister will not be binding. The news must still be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Rather, I feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but it does not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (especially in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency before the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he revealed the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they cannot be managed in half a year.
However, French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters of the breakup between the right and the left agree on a male, but in Europe, yes.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such a work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately commentated with criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In reality, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right French presidential candidate, Éric Zemmour, is currently driving around France with the benefits that the Vichy regime, which he collaborated with Hitler in World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with it in the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries tend to learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated in which battle.
But if they have no enlightened cantor, they will no longer learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for the best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held first place on the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy / fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was about like "having a flu / being a purple-cropped" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't really want to smoke...
Compared to common flu, it was worse.
I have no diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

Kristýna Plíšková did not make her final, her second title is still unique
The plush environment in Tashkent proved, in 2016 she won her first tournament at the WTA circuit here and she performed very confidently this year as well.
After wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she fought her way to the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvancková did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková soon went to a 3-0 lead and was unable to turn it back, even though she managed to convert one break point in the end. In the last one, she averted the match at the end, however, she lost one break point.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Houška: Should Czechoslovakia refuse the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? Three times NO?
The undated picture shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The purpose of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies could engage.
If almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would the most Czechoslovak soldiers, air force or perhaps artillery, take out of the fight? German tanks, air force or perhaps artillery, would it be quite possibly not even one of these weapons, although in them the Germans had an overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the biggest losses " due to blisters?
Zeman by a conservationist - The man of the exciting institute calls for the enforcement of the law
Those who move in a society divided in the camps and don't want to be completely fooled will welcome situations where they don't have to support only their own. When they can admit positives even to those whom they otherwise criticize. Already in order not to feel that they are oriented only according to the pre-allocated stickers. Such situations also include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman fences down on their favorite trips to the region.
Everyone knows what it is. And everyone who sometimes goes through the Czech Republic knows a number of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historic cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and estates - can see their own eyes. He knows that even here he may come to say demagoguery. If we set the city hall does not write about monuments or some horror in a spatial plan, it may be a work of former administrations. Or an object privatized by critics, "he calls for him to be admitted to you as the owner of the law, but if he calls for him to be free of fines.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a difficult problem. But he is considered a good thing just like squatters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the abuse of squatters, I point out the problem of outside of current interest. That the one or that building is in an emergency condition." And let's admit that the president does the same thing.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you dream of how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance liveres. At the time when Jáchymov is celebrated 500 years of silver mining and coinage (for Americans dollars). Why? Allegedly, due to the quickly surprised sale of houses at the age of the 1900s, local officials say. But what is the fact that seven kilometers away The island of Slik, the headquarters of Slik, who has a high-speed sale of the house at the age of 90, is a good point of these historical center, is well repaired by these things, says local officials.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere carriers change
From Sunday, trains according to the new timetable are starting to run on the railway.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time, or even their route slightly, will be adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the dormitories.
Carriers started selling tickets already during the autumn.
The Czech Railways plans to run on average 6,783 passenger transport connections per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be Interjet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 route Ústí nad Labem - Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will travel a total of 16 connections on the track every day, eight in each direction.
Other changes apply to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlářík, despite planned exclusive works, the carrier tried to keep its long-distance trains as running as similar as possible.
The operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
For example, passengers await changes in the Czech Republic, where the trains of the German company Die Landermann will run on the track from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere, we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
In my life, I have not heard classes from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks often sold themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you at school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while they were murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven't encountered anyone intentionally hiding facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we are already with those southern states, yes, the confederation flag and famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also have some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in South Africa was slavers and a lot of things were also against them.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view doesn't exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT, where they will leave someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that it was terrible at some universities, those students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them as many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a bit sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since reached what it had and it is no longer the same, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact are called feminists, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in the end, I also did not come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual: D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If something with people connects me with such interests, views of the world and common experience, not the place where we were born.
The police charged CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác due to contracts for promotion
According to CzechTourism, the police charged Aleš Pangrác with contracts for promotion. Pangrác server SeznamZpravy confirmed that he took over the charges this week. Czech TV (ČT) last year, she said police are investigating contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money was returned to Pangrác, the server reports. In the case of criminal investigators were also interested in the ministers for local development Klář Dostálová (ANO continues to fall behind her case).
Detectives from the National Central Office against Organized Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. They also took the official computer from the minister's apartment. In the court order to search Dostálova's home, which previously quoted ČT, it was stated that in 2016, when she was deputy to the standard police, she could document everything outside of CzechTourism and that she felt absolutely innocent and that she could document everything outside of the standard procedure with the standard police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of the individual. The media previously reported that it was Aleš Pangrác, the former director of the regional partnership department at CzechTourism, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This resulted in the CzechTourism agency concluding 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment any more on it," Pangrác told Severo Seznam Zpravy.
Toyota still believes hydrogen, preparing the second generation Mirai car
Toyota Mirai should have never been just a concept. Toyota thought it so serious that even though there was practically no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, she still put it in the menu. That's why not in a completely standard, the customer really had to go specifically around this car, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota's head Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will come next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years are price equal to hybrids. Of course, this is, of course connected with the development of pumping networks. However, the future is connected with hydrogen as well as electricity.
The conference often inflected the word hydrogen with the needs of ecological traffic, not passenger cars, but on the other hand, large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to be overcome for one refueling distance. Pure battery versions cannot offer. Toyota could find new markets thanks to its extensive experience and long development.
It remains to be remembered that, just like Toyota, Hyundai believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.
There are up to sixty times fewer insects than 40 years ago
No other animal class is represented in nature more than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of her life on Earth. But there are increasing reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic was released just this week, and according to her, the situation is even more serious than humanity has realized so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest in Puerto Rico, during which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, insects today there are "ten to sixty times fewer insects in the forest". This is a decline in the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research concerned not only, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction, the population will then become difficult as well as other fauna that is still dependent on birds or lizards in the food chain.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study thus shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much larger than previously thought.
A large article about the report was published in the Washington Post on Monday, which presents new findings immediately in the headline as hyperalarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," said entomologist David Wagner from the University of Connecticut, whose newspaper cites as an independent expert.
The extinction of insects also applies to Europe. "There is also a regular decline in our country," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomologists of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "We only run significantly longer than in Puerto Rico," adds Ci on the explanation why scientists could have measured such a rapid decline in the forest compared to 70s in the 1970s.
Nokia is suing a Brno company due to the name Lokia. People don't pay us, Moravians believe
Nokia filed objections to the application of the Lokia trademark to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, product confusion is unlikely.
The Brno-based company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns do not like that the Brno-based company's warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, wrote the E15 newspaper. Nokia therefore filed objections to the application of the Lokia trademark to the Industrial Property Office. CCV judges that the lock is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr Ondrášek said that two dozen customers have been using the program, it has been on the market since last September.
"Nokia is recognized and trusted around the world. When someone is trying to register a mark that we believe may lead to confusion or dilution of our brand, we will take steps to protect our valuable asset," Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said.
Brno developers claim they did not think of a brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating a warehouse program. According to CCV, the designation Lokia is based on the Latin name for one type of dragonfly, the rapid movement of which is supposed to be analogous to the movement of storekeepers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really moving into the field of mobile phone production. And we are not interested in comparing it to a brand that may be ensured by a train in its field," said CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
The CCV filed for trademark protection even before the program was launched at the Industrial Property Office in August. "She applied for protection for products and services belonging to 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to class 9, the related services of business management in the warehouse belong to class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification, said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that Nokia's earlier trade mark is valid in all classes of products and services, and thus applies to the widest possible range of products and services, and thus of course also overlaps in 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not challenge the claim of objecting, if it is the agreement of these classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups," said Ondrášek.
According to E15, a trademark dispute may last months and business may be complicated.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very good guy, the sermons are more about theology than politics, but then they always agree about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholicism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to Hussite services, because it is theologically very similar, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael's Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3: 00 p.m. they make mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic even this time, in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in every year with the section, I'm looking forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said scout Amálie to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing changes regarding the delivery of flambé in the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally went by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the parish bishop Vojtěch Cikrlel.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of the light, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep an distance, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply behave in such a way that it was as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, spokesman for the Bethlehem light event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light traveling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace with the flame at the same time.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvětlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money properly, but I don't understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices "xy financed / co-financed by the xy project" in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the retardation of development when this company adheres to and takes orders / employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its termination
Purposeful defamations? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested?
Last the last end of this month. The city management attributes this to the slander surrounding the former zoo director and veterinarian Václav Poživil that he purposely killed the exotic animals he cared for. For example, for the female rhinoceros Zamba, the elephant Kalu or the orangutan Nunák.
The city council therefore announced a new order. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the municipal Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said city spokeswoman Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city announced a competition for veterinary services for the third time in this way. "Doctor Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it a blatant dishonor of such a quality expert," she noted.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It is definitely nothing pleasant. The zoo currently provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "But in terms of financing, the garden must comply with the law on public contracts," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which cheetah cheetah Jane was the first in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as zoo director from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment anonymous slander on himself. Yesterday he did not answer phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As for the order for the zoo, some vets believe that zero interest in it does not necessarily have to be concerns about similar purposeful charges, as in his case, but simply a lack of awareness. For example, Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not yet heard of her. "I heard from you for the first time. No one has approached us. This kind of thing will spread quickly, I think, he added.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia Bíla!
On the day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová published her latest photos, on which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would judge me that I would take pictures of myself naked at my age. I'm quite a shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if she wanted to do so, it's even at the age of 46, it's a solid figure, of course, for that's not work," he said.
"We took about three thousand photos with Lukáš Dvořák, we chose about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came to her baptism, confided to Blesk very exposed.
She had an elongated Bernhardt jacket and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten her bottoms. Running every day strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucia Bíla.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes a person who was born Internet time is also caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think Internet ads won't move with me, but then I'm just as likely to affect me - it's just so overwhelming that you can't always resist it.
That is also why I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all a candleholder, in the words of a classic one - I would disable the Internet.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, spokesman for the mining company for ČTK, said.
The fire broke out at 04: 25 in a breach at a depth of about 1,200 meters. "None of the employees happened, no one was injured. On the spot immediately intervened mining rescuers, who immediately destroyed the fire by direct intervention and also carried out a terrain inspection. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible," said the spokeswoman. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karvina district, coal is now mined only in the Karvina part, namely in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, Č-North and ČSM-South mines. Mining in Dole Lazy should end this year, the gradually slow down is expected. Mining company OKD is also the only producer of black coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tons of people work in the mines in 9009.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not sheep after all, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'll claim is critical thought"
2. "After all, I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
The TV has fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present their viewers with a record-breaking more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been affected by audience viewers in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, so these films are getting more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were filmed than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their name, so in reality holiday movies will be much more.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are particularly associated with this period, films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came to light in a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, then included four movies and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the agenda, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical season, it doesn't matter much about the story again, it's important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that they're snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
"For the audience, it's a form of escapism and a way to feel a bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday craziness and craziness of the world we've been living in for at least two hours," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, however, successfully resolved and those kiss.
This is how it is all the time, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack on a better position from the 20th place he went in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will finally not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will go on to the track from the last place, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, while safety will be the ultimate priority for all parties involved, "her representatives said for Formula1.com.
He will not or cannot send a replacement driver to the Haas race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi " had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez No Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
They can also close you for this.
And everyone will be robbed that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 Spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introduction or spread of contagious disease in people will be punished by imprisonment for six to three years, a ban on activity or a decline in things.
(2) The offender will be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
C) if, by doing so, an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him under the law violates such an act, or
D) if such an act causes serious injury to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years if he causes serious damage to the health of at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years, if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
Is a pike in a pond or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low state debt. Or the fact that, according to one recent study, our country is twenty-four in the quality of life of 140 evaluated countries.
However, Developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot, in a TV interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, reported other, by far not as "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world at the speed of construction proceedings. It may happen that the current economic "boom" does not leave behind any significant architectural heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country simply has so far failed to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation in recent years to invest in the future. Although it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with a better standard of living will also want to have somewhere to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stands, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But for example, it has not been possible to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build high-speed rail or metro to the airport in the capital city of Prague for years. And Prague doesn't even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. At the same time, this is not just an absurd scramble for architectural competitions, spatial plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse.
And when it seems that something more daring could be a legend, it will almost certainly frustrate a memorial or other rather foolish associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to diggers.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone highway network, nor to start building high-speed train lines, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna with a "detour" via Bavaria. In addition, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes affected in the slenderian. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a puzzle.
Babiš entered politics with the promise that "things will be done". In terms of meaningful investments and acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, however, much has not happened yet. Although an amendment to the Act on accelerating the construction of transport infrastructure has been in effect since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive effects, for example easier expropriation of land. And a new construction law, approved by the government, which is said to reduce the current average duration of construction proceedings from 5.4 to 1 year should apply to about 2022, if we do not bet on many people.

Declaration of the end of the right in the lower house or what kind of "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Recently, there have been reports in the media and comments about the upcoming coalition of the mentioned parties. Many applaud the fact that the "right" finally comes together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
And when I leave aside the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the given subjects label themselves or what label mainstream media parrots. In its average, the ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the top politicians of this party, the OOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and thus hypocritically describes conservative or even more of its existence as centrist). However, the TDU essentially merges with its concept of TDU (TDU) to the left than they call itself a clear reason for its existence.
Do you feel that I have taken everyone out of one water? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal interference of the state in the lives of individuals and the economy. How many laws sow people's freedoms with the salami method, actions, taxes confirming new regulations and growing surveillance and increasing connection with the socialist or socialist right-wing parties have nothing to do with them in recent years? But how many of the laws governing freedoms of people, actions, which confirm the socialist or do not want to strengthen their lives or do with them?
I would not at all look at TOP 09, STAN and the KDU coalition cooperation, I simply belong to myself on a political map, and, in addition to Christian or, on the other hand, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see an obvious difference in them for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "the only right-wing" and, by associating with these three entities, it no longer openly reveals its actual political affiliation.
By the way, when I mentioned these stickers briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties label critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't they or just don't want to understand that there are many people who do not smell Eurosocialism and growing unfreedom as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they hiding their complete argumentation and blind or blind or blind European adoration conditions?
In short, it is possible that there is no other chance of greater success in the Czech Republic other than centrist politics. Maybe voters really want this kind of merger. Maybe they want a left-wing politics under the guise of "right", because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or can't even identify it). I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the WC
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Water Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth, fifth and eighth in Friday qualifying. The next three Czech representatives will aim for a semi-final start in the afternoon corrective qualifying run in Spain.
Vavřinec Hradilek, from a strong representative group of kayakers, did not succeed, who immediately at the beginning of the journey received a fifty-second penalty for incorrectly passing gate. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-finals.
"I set myself the goal of making the first run to thirty, which I did. I didn't care that I didn't care how I hit, because it's going to start very early on Sunday morning, so I hoped I'd be a bit higher to have a better starting position," Přindiš said, praising the well-being in Seu. "Before the patrol race, he felt the worst in 14 days, but here's what we've been here again been here for a good time and then it's nice races.
Prskavec was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you mainly don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn't really like it in the first stages. Then I drove Wednesday perfectly, without problems and I knew I'm going to have an attack, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go down directly and turned the mark. Overall, I can't be unhappy. In the form, we'll see how it will continue," said this year's overall winner of the World Cup.
Both representatives boasted that they would only start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not a morning bird, it's also cold here in the morning, and when you're here eighth, he wants to have a jacket and sweatshirt," Přindiš said. "In total, it takes the semi-finals for an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep, the Prskavec agreed.
Of the trio of Czech singkanoists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the top twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. "The upper part of the track I wanted to ride. I thought I didn't manage and I'm not going to go according to the plan, but I was able to get to the comfortable track I wanted to ride. She made two moves and just behind the winner in pure time I'm in a good starting semi-finals," praised Fiová.
The hunter injured him when he fell from his seat, they carried him to the ambulance for three hours
There was an unfortunate accident before half eight o'clock in the evening in the top parts near Čertova mlýn.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for cooperation between the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The paramedics then sent an ambulance to the accident," described the circumstances of intervention Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Service.
Rescuers found hunter in a chosen location with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty transported him to the so-called Austrian cart over impassable terrain.
"The transport on the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured Nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Service and at the same time an attending rescuer, fortunately a fellow hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured man was.
"That's why we found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka application on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been there earlier, and at the same time the dispatcher of line 155 would have known about the accident and its situation immediately," commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the activated Záchranka application should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Step down, Schiller called for words about the opposition dirt Czernin
"I consider it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, the less on the floor of the parliament, uses such a totalitarian expression," wrote Czernin in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir in discussing the draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not have enough votes and the draft constitutional lawsuit brought by the Senate was agreed upon by the MPs from the table.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is no single voice in support of this lawsuit. There are messages to support the president and the type of how taxpayers' money is spent here, how empty straw is being combined. And I even dare, I'm not using harsh expressions, one of them quoted: It's opposition and senator dirt," said the finance minister.
"These expressions were used by the Nazis by citizens of Jewish origin and communists against their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without a bit of respect for people and opinions," wrote TOP 09 vice-chairman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman in the autumn with the former first vice-chairman, Markéta Pekarová Adamová.
"I quoted one of the many reports that I received dozens of during the session of the Chamber of Deputies. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal dishonor that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive of Thursday's session of the Chamber. That someone applies to myself," Schillerová responded to ČTK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. This is in response to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and for the bank to then pay to suppliers of this oil company by cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal for the central bank to count on foreign reserves that are now near 30 years old.
Sanctions imposed by the United States against the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This further deepened the country's economic crisis. However, the current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro's bid to launch the world's first state cryptocurrency failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways in which restrictions would try to find.
Neither Venezuela's central bank nor PDVSA responded to a comment request.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoins and ethers, nor how great the value of these currencies it owns. The company has problems getting payments from customers through conventional channels, because large banks are not willing to trade with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the $70 million (16. billion CZK) payment in Chinese yuan, because the parties failed to find financial institutions would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may be reluctant to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as it would require it to register on the exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to the entities that the PDV owes. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise when paying for cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies due to money laundering problems and customer information related to them and complicate compliance.
After the debacle of 2018, cryptocurrencies are seeing a return to prominence this year thanks to expectations of greater institutional adoption and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has decreased by almost 20 in the last four days, but since the beginning of the year it has gained about 130 percent.
Tough competition for ŠKODA Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly one of the compact SUVs, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves this bigger Sportage sibling, which is so direct in response to cars like Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear can remotely resemble the world of the buyout popular in this part of the market, especially among premium brands Audi-Benz or BMW-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot only be placed alongside the plasticized versions of classic compacts, which include, for example, the Ford Focus Active. Compared to that, the Koreans made a much larger number of changes to the body, so those who don't want may not even have to see Ceed in the forms of the news.
In contrast to the compact hatchback or estate Ceed, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic 140-liter. The XCeed also comes with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged 160-liter with 150 kW, reserved for GT siblings. Don't expect a sporty grade of 1.6 CRDi turbodiesels only in a mild-hybrid helps reduce the consumption of a seven-speed internal combustion engine, which means that the internal combustion engine is also assisted by a seven-speed manual.
The offer will soon be expanded by a plug-in hybrid, i.e. a variant that will travel approximately six dozen kilometers only on electricity. The batteries can also be charged from a normal socket.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings in it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters have never worn much with us at home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work within half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were delivered by Swarovski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
"Wool and cotton are the basis, but silk will give the sweater softness," praising the creator of his work, which, however, is not recommended to wish.
And it has one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater so far, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If MZ is detached from reality, it doesn't matter very much - he will have a faulty circuit blown out and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that the departure of the FB from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (under the influence of which it is supposed to be unlucky).
I think it would clean up the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of "Soviet fraternal aid" to some of our political parties and representatives would also be better clarified.
Then the people who vote for them should also more clearly, which interests they really care about.
It's a shame that TikTok doesn't own either.

Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against the two-game sentence
Football Sparta appealed against the two-game sentence for striker Benjamin Tetteh, who received the player from the disciplinary committee for excluding Slavia (0-3) in Sunday's derby.
The Letenský club informed about it on its twitter and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeals commission.
Tetteh already served half of the sentence in Wednesday's domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now trying to ensure that the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker can play in Sunday's 11th round first league match in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who received a one-game suspension from the disciplinary committee on Thursday against Liberec.
The appeals committee did not manage to discuss the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the sentence and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
Finally, the Commission confirmed a one-game suspension for the midfielder from Olomouc in the next week, and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The Tenant Tetteh's activities for the foul stopped at the Slavicist David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card at the 82nd minute from the referee Miroslav Zelinka.
Allegedly, the spitting of Ghanaian player to the captain of opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.

Spilková in a pair. In Indianapolis, after the first round, she is on the verge of procedure
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship tournament in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys and finished on the opening day in the pair. With the result of 72, she was 69th place, which is expected to cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not participate in the second half of the tournament in Portland. She finished her rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after the previous illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament on the European LET series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she is not doing very well. Out of twelve tournaments, she went through cut three times, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. She is thus fighting to keep her card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played by the top Korean Mountain Mi-chung. After the first round, it has a score of -9 and a lead of two before the three opponent.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She looked younger in her fair hair
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she never looked like a retiree. And now she helped it even more. She changed her image until her colleagues did not recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who should have gray hair, worn used things and went to society sporadically. She always cared for herself and the older she is, the more she can dare in terms of her image.
Fortunately, she didn't succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of old well-known well-influenzas. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paid off. But now she has changed her hair color and completely looked through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. She not only had lighter and shorter hair, but was also dressed in a yellow jacket that made her shine even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate each other that even at the threshold of seventy they can risk taking into account. And Petra paid off, she looks maximum fifty.

I really don't see how the Union would stop giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can claim that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that is a completely different discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There is only one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are cold, if you are green, then you are one of the warm types. At the time of a new lipstick, first of all, just break down the undertone. In the next, take into account the texture.
If you're talking to women with a cold undertone, purple, plum, cherry or mauve lipsticks are suitable for you.
If you fall into the warm skin undertone category, choose such lipsticks and lipsticks. You will recognize them according to the fact that they gravitate towards orange, coral, gold or brown departures.
You may find that some veins appear green and others appear blue. In that case, congratulations - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.

According to critics, the end of political tabloids? The new law will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to allow ministers to get rid of responsibility for the election and at the same time continue to choose their own candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the goals of the Nomination Act. 119 MPs spoke for this. The law has passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, social democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before the government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation for the minister binding. That didn't finally succeed.
Civic democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will impose restrictions on ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some decision of the commission and will therefore not have a clear transparent responsibility," thinks SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. Vice-chairman of the ODS, Martin Kupka, speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt free, a minimum age of 25, and the main selection criteria should also be expertise.
The law will still have to go through the Senate and then it will be signed by the president.
The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could go before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help the Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland officially asked NATO countries to help, in connection with the actions of the Belarus regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to their territory with a false promise of easy crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
The chairman of the police department Štěpánek resigned, he wants to live as a free person
The chairman of the Independent Trade Union of Police, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave office. He said this on Friday Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the union since 2005. The chairman of the union will be another two months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I handed over my written resignation to the board, for which I will continue to perform my duties fully for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I decided as a free person who doesn't want to forever be tied to the trade union. And who wants to live a more peaceful life," he said.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for security forces. For example, in 2011, the union was also in a dispute with then Minister of the Interior Radek John and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, possible reality?
The Saber combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed at which it flew Concorde. "If the Saber engine is put into operation, this could allow us to fly to Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And for example, the distance between London and New York could be covered by the aircraft for one hour.
Server Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which five times the speed of sound is exceeded, are complicated due to engine overheating. However, the Saber (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem due to the use of super cold helium, which should prevent the temperature from rising.
"The most important thing about Saber is that it is a hybrid of rockets and aircraft engine, which is powered by a stream of exhaust gases created from the air," says Shaun Driscoll from Reaction Engines. "Rockets have not developed so much in the last 70 years, while the aircraft do. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very lightweight and effective propulsion system and essentially create a space system.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to start around mid- next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
I have a heart like a bell and a non-smoker's lungs. I'll just take a few infusions to joke Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, doctors did not find any "disease conditions" with the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors discovered mild signs of dehydration at the president's examination. His problems with low pressure were caused precisely by insufficient watering. "To manage the dehydration of the body, I will have several infusions that will get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the UVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral received several hateful messages due to a medical examination.
According to the president, doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single place on his body. "So a quick recap: Heart beats like a bell, lungs are clear as if it were not a smoker, liver works as if I were abstinence, kidneys are also fine and I can continue on and on," said Zeman.
Editors of iDNES.cz turned to a military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement on her health.
The question of Zeman's health became a topic especially at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president walks poorly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and is worse heard. He has cut down on smoking.
For a holiday only with a payment card? Neo account offers free ATM withdrawals around the world!
According to the survey, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have used to paying directly by card. The main reasons include, in particular, convenience, safety, as well as the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often connected with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but nowadays payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to repeatedly go to the exchange office to exchange. And even" vacationers don't want to rely on the fact that they are enough. Moreover, some foreign currencies of the Czech bank or exchange offices do not have cash or do not have cash with the NEO account. And therefore, in order to solve all users' communications with Expobank CZ, they are therefore free of charge.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way to lose your money than cash. In the event of losing a full wallet, its owner may no longer have to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately by phone or via internet banking. In case of quick action, he will suffer any financial loss at all. "In addition to their reliable protection, he has other advantages. For example, in the NEO, it is interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current account accounts, and the highest among current account management accounts, which is insured up to 10,000 euros per year, and adds Kateřina Petko to the highest among current account accounts, without their reliable protection.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay with a card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, only owning a payment card itself often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, for embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these can also insure their family, which they travel. Therefore, Kateřina Petbankko often pays for any other arrangements for insurance. However, it is always advisable to check all activities in CZ.
The basketball players did not reach the medal from the WC under the age of 17, they finished fourth
The third WC 17 was also won by the Americans, who in the final defeated Spain just 77: 75 despite 40 points by Spaniard Angela Salvadoresová.
"We wanted to win very well and not be potatoes, but maybe we wanted it too much. We grabbed the beginning, but it didn't manage to keep it because they rolled us under the basket," lamented captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking the lead 8-0 thanks to two three-pointers and dominating the court throughout the first quarter. At that time, it seemed that they would avenge the defeat from the basic group 85-88 after overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls and helped Hungary get back into the game with questionable decisions.
"I'm convinced that it was enough to put two more three baskets, run to 20 points and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch," coach Richard Fousek assessed.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything go and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
Especially Petra Holešínská held accurate shooting from a distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter on the court. The Hungarians used it and gained a slight lead, which they have already maintained, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five matches were very demanding, we turned the matches in a narrow rotation and it cost us a lot of power. It was already seen against Spain that the girls are tired and there was nowhere to take. Due to the physicalian, we were not consistent in defense. We didn't play a quick counterattack, we missed it. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, you're hard to win," added Fousek.
He believes that his ward is awaiting a promising future. "In two years, the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, although they are second at the 16-year-old European Championship, and now they are fourth in the world. It is a quality team with a good character for us, and it is necessary to further work and develop talent. Now is the federation, which the coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the ZŠ Adamov is not proven, "said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region in the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children from one of them, two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov elementary school.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four risk free course.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of the mentioned traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, come into contact with anyone who resides abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
The main hygiene manager Pavel Svrčín previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was tested.
There were also players from South Africa on it, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to proceed as Texas in banning abortion.
California governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous US state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortion detection of heart rate embryos.
People would then be entitled to compensation in lawsuits against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's position of the US Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in effect, although it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to apply across the US until the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
"I am outraged yesterday's (Friday) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said California governor.
"If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use this power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work on measures in cooperation with the state parliament and the justice minister to authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers are designated and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation from at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, ghost "parts or kits for their production in California.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets, we should exactly do so," said the California governor.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June the federal judge struck down the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state had now really renewed the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US countries in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court of Texas did not grant full immunity to court review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses has already been widely valid from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has a long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should soon be on the market.
Feel free to leave the amount of curriculum.
But rethinking WHAT is learned.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and it's really a waste of time.
In these things, it would really be possible to cut down brutally.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things that will have to be needed for life?
How can I legally watch Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to monitor the Champions League for a fee?
At home, we have a Netbox and I pay for a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change the TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobr, the European Commission would act in contradiction with the law if it used new powers and stopped the payment of Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure of the European Parliament to go on and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a sentence on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, which we are also contributing to, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in access to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent for Ziobr effect threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to subvert the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the rule of the most powerful and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of a colony," he said.
Someone killed non-conflict homeless people under the bridge. The police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder happened sometimes between early evening and night from Tuesday to Wednesday. This is the time when the police call for any testimony applies.
"One of the drivers who drove along the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the Pod Krejcárkem street could have filmed the killer, for example, on the dashboard camera. Some witness could have only seen him and could have described him. In short, we welcome any testimony to this case and accept it on line 158," said regional police spokeswoman Jan Daněk.
According to spokesman Daňák, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflictual, did not drink alcohol and did not seek a company of other people. The woman lived at the crime scene. "She was most often around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she carrying large blue shopping bags," added Daněk to the description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Mahulena Bočanová interrupted her annual detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Blesk that she had been drinking alcohol. "During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my old worn-out 50-year-old body a breathe.

I also liked the non-alcoholic beer I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who is still a few with Brno entrepreneur Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theater season after the holidays and will now be appearing in the series Ordinace in the rose garden. "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I argued. But it's already better," smiles the critical actress.

And I don't really care anymore.
I have been watching data like manure here for two years, most of the vaccination opponents are just a little more out of line than most vaccination representatives.
Although rational discussion takes place at a professional level, only extreme opinions reach the public space.
Wall to wall all the time.
Binary thinking: Vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two countries is not addressed by anyone.
Let's do it, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the climb and I wish you all a nice day.
They punished me with a wooden spoon in their childhood.
It was never due to grades, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I would do it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next "timed" wooden spoon only brought and put it in such a way that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few blows on my ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, it is important to me to see the part with a warning, because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether he will not listen and get it, or the punishment will be improved and the punishment will not be improved.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
Former French president Chirac will be buried on Monday, the public piet will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French president Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place at Montparnasse cemetery in Paris on Monday evening. The French media report this, citing the Chirac family, will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a piet in Paris's Invalides, where a casket with Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Elysee Palace announced.
According to AFP, crowds of people have been moving to the presidential headquarters since Thursday evening to sign a condolence book. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron announced state mourning.
Meanwhile, from the world and from France, further responses are coming to the death of former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "French in the true sense of the word".
For example, Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, as the politician was known for her love for their country and for sports sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
In honor of the former head of state, the tribal art museum on Paris's Quai Branly street, which Chirac founded, will not have to choose admission for ten days.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether the sacred document for which he swears and for which he learned at school from childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, definitely leaning towards the first concept.
Once we have agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: Some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has become more and more and more common among lawyers.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right in one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
Among other things, the constitution is a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set game rules for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
COVID doesn't choose, they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby in FN Brno
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novim.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially recently, "added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-COVID syndromes were at the department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, i.e. pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said and added that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
"Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age," said the primary.
However, it is happy that no child deaths have yet been recorded in the coronavirus at the Children's Hospital of the Brno University Hospital.
According to available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic.
According to Dominik, an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist is in a children's hospital - not only at the coronavirus department.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
"That's why we also recommend the application of the vaccination dose in children," added the doctor.
Line D will be overseen by a new metro architect, he brings experience from London underground
The Prague Transport Company has chosen an architect who will oversee the shape of a metropolitan metro. From October, it will become Anna Švarc, her primary task will be the appearance of a new line D, but she will also take care of the existing station. According to her, it is not only possible to see the metro as a transport structure, traveling underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender issued by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other bidders participated in the tender. "Part of the selection process was a motivational letter and a CV. Apparently, my previous one from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for her local metro in a team of three people," explains the new metro architect. According to her, she could also decide on experience from the Institute of Planning and Development of Hl. city of Prague.
He does not see the metro only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have an aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will be improved,. But I will learn how it will actually take place only in the coming weeks, when a transport company will introduce me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"It's not a series of dogmas, but rather a recommendation, the aim of which is above all to keep the context of all stations in place in case they are reconstructed," explains the manual's design.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in Prague's metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "I don't really know yet whether the manual is ideal, or whether it can cover some personality," concludes Švarc.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb a fence into the field).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside of marked paths can't be anywhere if you don't have an exception (but of course it doesn't apply even so much outside national parks).

This right must apply to the Lessor without undue delay; the right expires if it has not been exercised within one month of the removal of defects.
If the Lessee does not notify the Lessee of the damage or defect without undue delay after he should have and could have discovered it in due care, he is not entitled to reimbursement of costs; if he removes the damage or defect himself, he does not even have the right to a discount on the rent.

B. makes construction modifications or other significant changes without the consent of the Landlord,
C. will not notify the Lessor of the need for repairs beyond the scope of routine maintenance and will not allow him to carry out these repairs, as a damage to the property of the Lessor or third parties in the amount of ten times the monthly rent,

F. repeatedly violates the usual rules for behavior in the house and the Landlord's reasonable instructions for maintaining proper order and despite the notification does not seek to remedy.
The lessee violates his obligation arising from the lease in a particularly serious manner, in particular, if the debt for unpaid rent or advance payments for services, with the payment of which the lessee is in arrears, exceeds the amount corresponding to three times the amount, or the underpayment for billing is not completely paid for a period of three months from the due date.
Article IX. Returning the apartment
The lessee is obliged to clear out the apartment at his own expense no later than the day of termination of the lease, remove all equipment and accessories he has installed in the rented premises, and hand over the apartment to the lessor in the condition in which he received it from him, taking into account normal wear and tear.

The Lessor will send any cash surplus to the Lessee to the Lessee's account provided by the Lessee.
Minor repairs and costs associated with the routine maintenance of the apartment, the need for which arose until the end of the lease, will be ensured by the Tenant no later than the date of handing over the apartment (end of the lease).
If the Tenant does not do so, the Landlord will ensure the necessary repairs and routine maintenance at the Tenant's expense.
The Tenant agrees with this.

China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a better crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for not being able to stop the infection that was turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors often help in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
They released hundreds of enslaved children from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, said that there were over three hundred children aged five and over. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
The head of the police at Kaduna Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid at school was carried out on a tip-off. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, it was a case of slavery.
Several people were detained during the raid, according to police spokeswoman Jakubu Sabo, they were local teachers.
The children told the police that they were taken to school by their parents or relatives, saying that they were a religious school. "We identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by their parents from the Nigerian states in the north," said spokesman Sabo to the identity of the victims. The Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal was issued as a religious school aimed at studying the Qur'an.
The liberations were taken to the stadium where they were provided with help and food. Some have already encountered relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Banks provide children's accounts free of charge. However, it is necessary to consider the offer, because some other services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management is usually free is straightforward. Financial houses count on returning to them once. When small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, monitor account movements, has his own electronic banking available somewhere. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to their parents to teach their children how to handle them and also to control their payments.
"A relatively flexibly parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, etc. Above all, he can monitor what's happening on the account, either by viewing it via the Internet or thanks to an information SMS. Be careful, these may no longer be free," adds Kuncová and adds: "If the parent is considering an account for his child, he should consider his abilities and options.
Jaromír Soukup spoke of Gott: He mainly wishes for peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not ask any questions. There are no questions about various topics in his show Call and write to the boss. And he doesn't have any tabloid cases that he glosses in a flash and humorous way. Although this time he was not laughable.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly, without having to poke somewhere tabloid journalists. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would of course wish him successful treatment and, above all, peace! That he needs now," stated Barrandov TV owner.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And wait for the reports that the Master himself decides to provide to the media himself. I don't even like the various statements that his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about the condition of his health. And for our media, I can say that we will focus on his illness and his person only if I show interest in it. According to me, a similar approach should also consider other media.
The couple wrapped her bitch in tape and drowned in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a donated dog between one and two years old, which she wanted to take care of. But her ten years older partner didn't like that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and largely eliminated its vocalization. He put the dog in a jute bag that he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river where they threw it in the bag. At the moment when they threw the dog into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, the children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of the dead dog inside. They therefore called to the woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency call line 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the residents of the town, the police discovered who are probably the perpetrators of this incredible act. And they were not wrong. Both a man and a woman pleaded guilty for the act and described how the event happened," police spokeswoman added.
Professional expression from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly tortured manner as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered in a few minutes before death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, although they could donate or sell the dog. The Commissioner of the Criminal Police from Zlín charged a pair of committing a crime of animal cruelty committed in co-partnership. Both so far unpunished accusations could be spent behind bars for up to three years," noted Kozumplíková.
Plane crash near Žinkov in Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people, a man (" 63) and a woman (" 38) traveled on the plane. "At 9: 30 in the evening, the plane requested permission to land at Chaloupky airport near Klatov," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at that time according to the GPS coordinates, it should have been near Vojovice near Žinkov.
However, it did not arrive at the Klatovsk airport. However, the search for a lost plane, which sent an emergency signal, began immediately. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was also involved," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. However, the search operation had no happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane was last destroyed, a wreckage of the helicopter crew noticed before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies without signs of life," confirmed Korandová.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in tree branches, pieces also fell on the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Aviation Accidents," added Korandová.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, preventing
The traditionally very watched fight for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The 23-year-old American is the leader of the world charts over time 9.81 seconds and only lost once this year. But his start at the top of the season was at risk due to cases with missed doping tests.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case at the beginning of September without filing charges for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. However, the World Anti-Dod Agency (WADA) dated his first offense back on 1 April 1, 2018, i.e., however, the test itself missed to 6 June 2019 and third omission occurred in April 2919 due to failure to three missed checks.
Coleman argued that he simply forgot to update the data in the app about the athletes' whereabouts. "I don't take drugs or anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's all about," he said before the start of the WC.
He suffered the only defeat out of six starts this year at 100 at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where compatriot Noah Lyles surpassed him in just six thousandths of a second. He used Coleman's absence to triumph in the final of the Diamond League, but will run only two hundred at the WC.
The paper second fastest competitor is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has only been doing well in American university competitions so far.
The 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June, will defend the title. But the last 100 in Zagreb ran in just 10.29, because he slightly injured his hamstring.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favorites. The fastest Jamaican is the world champion from 2016 with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100 will start with preliminary round and heats on Friday. The semi-finals and finals are on the program on Saturday. The medal will take place at 21: 15 CEST.
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey don't you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with a trunk, the children play with him.
Well, she's just great.
If you want for 5,000, - I will sell you the elephant.
Friend: So well, Yes, it's going to be great...
After some time, they will meet and the one who has bought complains: Those who you sold it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, everywhere giant shit, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants to divorce.
What he sold says: You talk badly about an elephant, you won't sell a elephant this way...
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The priority of the children's clinic is built by an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people recognize that he is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad study in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. The pediatric clinic in Prague's Motol tried to get some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to get a lot of extra time. The Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Sulaymaniyah, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and treats small patients as a private practice. In addition, she teaches at the university
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
So far, this still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It will not be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But, for example, in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will lead.

It also occurred to me and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm using words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that these are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces", i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept, and it is not necessary to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I'm just playing words: D
Whether it's the way it is, it's a ridiculous request
An earthquake with a magnitude of five was recorded in Tokyo.
A 5.0-degree earthquake hit the Japanese capital of Tokyo and the surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damage has been reported yet.
No tsunami warning has also been issued, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland tortured the monkey marmoset Milly from Britain
Horrifying footage shows the moment when the terrified monkey cowered in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed it up and laughed at her.
Holland monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent Magistrates Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who take care of Milly after her abuse say they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother pleaded guilty to two accusations that she caused unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat and for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, her point of view of new people can still cause panic.
Psychological scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone after raiding her apartment due to drug accusations.
In the footage, it can be heard how Milly profanity profanity.
Another video shows Holland offering cocaine to the monkey and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to keeping cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found in her house for 1,600 pounds (roughly 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
As if you take away the same things in the breast as in the sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffooning, when no one, with exception, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Without and on the street, you ask random people if they can manage to determine the character of the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority will not even hide and tell you that they are completely in a pick.
So what the fuck is learning for?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people don't want and don't need them.
And at that point it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need the thing they need.
But as well, the note that you really don't need all this for standing by the machine really doesn't need it all, I thought very seriously...... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly reach the time when not knowing is a mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and bullying against educated people and elites probably also play a part in us) However, the price that barbarians will simply be high among those machines will become our own.
For example, if journalists could count, the covid probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately, "Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
It was creaky between Kadri and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, i.e. at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He immediately dealt with Kadri's accusations of lying, gambling and debt in response to Andrea.
Even his younger sister Linda didn't like Kadri's supposed honesty now.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don't comment on such things at all and even in the family we've never really said these things very extra.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and beat the name of someone I like so much, I just can't get it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was young.
I'm more sorry for that when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in a confession in response to Andrea's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao started his robbery trip in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he finally stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he didn't think anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment with an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
The footage from one security camera shows how he goes along the street away from the crime scene, while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he discovered that bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank something of alcohol on a day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob him of drunkenness.
The whole thing is still in investigation.
The monkey climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.

More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities

The former mayor of the municipality of Jan Křižková, who is a member of the Private Party, also got into the council again for them.
Komňanea - independent candidates - reached one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimsk region, the association Pro Rovná won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 got to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.

Epilepsy complicated his love for sports, thanks to the operation he has new hope
Honzík's parents first noticed that something was wrong with him, in the year and a half. He always looked into space, became motionless and did not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a children's neurology clinic, where doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations, and immediately also put on medication that did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, the doctors stopped taking the medication, and since they did not return, his parents thought Honza was healthy and started to lead him to sports more. He was riding a bicycle, skiing, playing tennis and floorball, spent free time playing games with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, but at the age of 11, he got another seizure and it all started.
Doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing happened, seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honzo always stopped seeing him during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get him during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding a bicycle and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although from time to time, the sport caused him a seizure, he will never completely give up. He even fulfilled a dream and the Spartan Race in case of emergency, which, together with a friend, kept helping him in case of constant contact with his eyes.
When Honzo was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the General Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, his doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the bearing from my brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to undergo 2 operations in me, first doctors inserted probes into the probes, sensed the activity, then they could only remove the bearing from my brain. It was connected for me. I just remembered wires that were sticking out of my computer for a few weeks, which were wires connected with the computer.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the rather extensive bearing. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Compared to how lively and communicative he is normally, it was a horrifying change, but fortunately everything returned to normal after a few days," he describes mom and adds: "He should have treated 1 month and a half of the operations, but according to doctors it has become seizure free since then.
This school year, Honza will graduate from school, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and began working with Company E, with which he goes to schools for talks about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully involved in sports activities, he is slowly returning to sports. "I'm learning how to do sports correctly, how to breathe well, so that my body does not expose sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional Eppi paddling triathlon, in which patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet and takes place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at Veselská pískovna. But next year it may already be.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know everything that people write to you here.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to "argue with".
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like many church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which after all was the goal for them to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what they do.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old one
Tl; dr: Believe, for example, in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together

The French chef is sued with Michelin to remove the star. He is suffering from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star this January, a year after he won it. He intends to be sued by the publisher of the Red Guide to get exactly the reasons for the downgrade. Veyrat also doubts the competence of Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, confused saffron with cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. According to him, the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin Guide will be sued because the commissioner's conclusion was not properly justified. Moreover, according to him, the star withdrawal occurred without any notice. "I suffer from depression for six months. How do you dare to play the health of the cooks?" He sent a message to Veyrat commissioners?
Michelin said that only provided the chef with vague reasons, such as that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which did not like the inspection. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. Since the beginning, I have been working with Savoy ingredients," Veyr argued against the decision. He is convinced of a strong incompetence of Michelin Michelin commissioners, "since the beginning," he has been dealing with Savoy ingredients, "he pointed out to me against the Veyr decision. He is convinced of our strongly incompetence in our commercial cows for every morning that you have only allowed us to stir up our herbs" for our own reasons.
The distinctive chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is the opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and that's why he calls for his restaurant to be removed from the Red Guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the company remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful charges so far and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. "We are sorry that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
The man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operating center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
Upon arriving at the paramedic's place, they discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man should have fell out of the window from a height of about twelve meters and fell head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and firefighters went to the event.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue service team, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, ensured artificial pulmonary ventilation and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokeswoman of the EMS of the Ministry of Health of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than from the coronavirus from inadequate reactions of both the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are primarily on the first line of the fight against infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile virus infection from mosquitos in its territory. This is related to climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit, for example, malaria.
Germany announced on Friday the first case when one was hit by a West Nile fever in the German territory after being hit by an infected mosquito. According to experts, DPA reported this. Until now, all sick people have become infected with a virus when traveling or contact with sick animals. According to experts, a breakthrough case of infection is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a 70-year-old man from Saxony was infected with the virus. The disease had a serious course and was treated in the hospital in Leipzig due to brain inflammation. It is now healthy.
West Nile virus was first identified in Uganda in 1937. Meanwhile, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe and also to the United States in the 1990s. Its carriers are mainly birds and also mosquitoes, which become infected with their infected blood.
Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
There are things to do at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a defeater.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in a lightweight bond, he put a great choke on Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a female bantamweight match between famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňová.
The American entered the mutual battle as a imaginary "dwarf", because Nunesová had not lost for seven years and grinding her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the start of the duel took place in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively, and the opponent even pushed the kick she sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced to any other mistake, and she tried to attack with a lever on her arm herself unsuccessful.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents started with a lot of excellent blows and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock off the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the card gradually started to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to match the opponent with lever to hand.
He didn't do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and filled him with a number of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, on the other hand, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a sovereign triumph, who already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiv in the first round.
He then charged him with a number of exactly-aimed blows and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated her next triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are masculine, feminine and central.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, for which the gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they then acquire double endings and in some cases remain uninflected.
For example, the words "rope" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the first they inflected according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the "song".
For another group of nouns, different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example: "Rádek / rádka", "kedluben / kedluben / kodlubenna" or "/ brambor" (in the sense of food).
At the same time, both forms are literary, they have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example, "okurek" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is uninflected, there are also other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "Okure" and "kopa, "donut" and "donut" etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained uninflected in the central gender, but has endings according to the pattern of "castle" in the masculine gender.
Civilization in borrowed time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "message" from one of Šimek's great stories with Grossmann, taking place partly in the cemetery, as follows: "I warned her that she cries well, but on a foreign grave!" I thought many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are behaving very similarly now.
They act as if humans rule planet earth. In reality, we are just a speck on its surface, which she can blow away with her immense powers as a strong gust of wind a candle flame. Probably few of them watch the famous British and American science documentaries discussing the destructive capabilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to really "crack up" and our advanced civilization ruined.
And that it will happen in the near future is highly likely. In the opinion of the leading volcanologists, many large volcanoes have "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if that eruption, if it had to happen, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are completely wasted on measures aimed at reducing the production of carbon dioxide, because any really angry volcano, together with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release it into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than was saved at the expense of the inhabitants of Europe.
It therefore makes no sense to forcefully limit CO2 production. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that, in its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of ice age.
If we realize this still insufficiently researched influence of the solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we have to come to a single reasonable conclusion: Let's try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible and adapt to other changes that we cannot cope with forcefully with!

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to venture to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewable resources will not cover increased demand, says the head of European ExxonMobil.
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unfavorable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, claims this in an interview for HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities in which unused energy from days when the sun and wind are plentiful could be stored for later, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the center of ExxonMobil in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services needed for the company's operation.
We didn't see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future for in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with sexual violence in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don't personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I experienced how often they are treated by their surroundings or the police.
The victims should always be trusted.
The trend has happened that victims finally open up about their traumas.
But still, only a lot of people keep it for themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations is made up of" and that it is only a "trend" you help sexual rapists.
Soldiers rehearse, draw the curtains. China is preparing celebrations on the site of the massacre
The army rehearsed the parade during recent weekends. Shops in the center of Beijing had to close and the residents near the square were ordered to bend the curtains. Military vehicles rolled to the square and fighter planes in the sky beat up on the empty streets.
Several Chinese told Reuters that they were proud to see their country flaunt its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would make other countries uneasy.
She appeared to have come across Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are coming to terms. But she may also be worried in a semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against China's achieved manager.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen already on Thursday night demonstrated a special light show. Xiamen is located opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of prohibited things has been growing. It already has drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, The Guardian pointed out. He added that China's favorite social network Weibo is deleting "harmful political information".
"It's another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the helm) despite all odds," said China historian Maura Cunningham. "It is the time when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was established in 1949 when the Communists under Mao Zedong won in the fight against Chiang Kai Nationalists who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of a so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators from the ranks of students and workers.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly adopted elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (monopoly of one party and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
The Czechia is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to complete
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of that.
She does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and even pay rent for it, "says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
In a year, we build two to three family houses and fifty percent of them happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult for us to abide by some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earning money, "said the owner of the construction company Zdeňěk Slivoň.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait, "added Slivoň.
Copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive of the materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, construction graduates are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said Křeček.
We're doing well and we're doing better.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance to the new year has traditionally been accompanied by the speeches of politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO, Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
The ministry has been planning a flat-rate meal plan since 2021. Nothing changes in terms of taxes
The IF is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the IF, even a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive food stamps, will do so.
According to the chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, David Rýč, however, a number of small companies, which do not have canteens or food stamps, also provide meals for their employees, such as importing food or agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the plan is that we do not change anything about the tax benefit. Furthermore, health and social insurance will not apply to it," Schillerová said on Friday. She added that the limit for the employer's maximum contribution will also be applicable as a tax discount.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal ticket. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases the employer also pays them, but without a tax discount. This year the most advantageous value of the meal voucher for employees and employers is CZK 123.
As in that, the diploma looks great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor, I always work on it all year round and then I write a written part in a week or two.
Stateswomen are completely calm with us, if a person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him unnecessarily on theory.
For example, I learned a week at the stateswomen and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to guide me to some logical derivation that immediately came to me and I was right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, they will teach them) and then they will just learn the project and they are sufficient.
In my opinion, it is great if there is an exam at the end of the course in which the knowledge gained in the project is reflected, not just a defense.
Autotuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, reads the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. It is then written in a provocative explanation that the medical community ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a merciless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people, which not only affected public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now is the paradigm for the new time.
What Hobbes states right at the beginning is the fact that from knowing and knowing facts to putting them into practice often leads a very long and tedious journey. He mentions the case of scurvys, when some captains already distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the seventeenth century, with the belief that they will prevent this disease. However, the British Navy has since then, due to concerns that increased costs of paragraph 1, the clear effect of fruit in preventing and then preventing death confirmed his death occurred in the 1960s before 1930s in connection with his car security belts, but it took into account the first confirmed death in the 1960s and 1960s.
"Every discovery in the field of public health - and no matter how important it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the society in which it should have been implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society, almost 80 percent of the adult population and around one third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than breast cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinson and HIV together.
At the same time, obesity is seen as a supremely personal failure of an individual that is claimed to burden the healthcare system and reduce GDP. The fear of being fat is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, it is true that diets don't work. Already in 1599, research showed that 95 to 88% of attempts to lose weight end with failure and two-thirds of dieters subsequently lost weight than they lost weight.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Personal meets the systemic, when, for example, at faculties, when teaching future doctors, only 19 hours of the entire course are devoted to the issue of nutrition. Which at a time when 60 calories Americans consume comes from ultra-processed food - i.e. too much processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries where overweight people typically experience shorter visits, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
However, obesity is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980 the proportion of obesity in 73 countries has doubled and increased in 113. And at that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase has become completely none.
But don't hit everything ok with e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same pee as them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put her in such a way that she can kick Xi Jinping's ass or somehow.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you can't store stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, the furt changes what is more important for the function, whether a lawyer, comment or save.
I'm very sorry lately, so maybe I'll have to reduce to tiktok, where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and can't almost commit to it.
In the end, I would also be happy if something more user-friendly came to light that doesn't drain all the creativity and energy of artists
Declaration of the Workers' Party of Donbass
The Union - yes, it will break - no, in the picture I express my opinion of the opponents of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Association of USR entities of international law and as geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
One budget pen "canceled a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
By the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the Bialowieza Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, separated fourteen republics from the world's greatest power, which were previously economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the extinction of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, and the breakdown of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all as a result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first of all, the socialist camp and the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "a vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly due to the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident on D5: The highway closed the truck collision
The event was reported around 08: 00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can drive through a gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2: 30 p.m. According to Richev, preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Petr Svoboda, spokesman for Central Bohemian Fire Department, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was transporting plastic granules. "Due to a large impact, there was a displacement of the transported vehicles, which the firefighters had to first ensure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 liters. Workers from the environment department of the Berun City Hall were called to the accident due to fuel leak. The recovery of crashed vehicles and the opening highway was ensured by a private company, which also excavated contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the fact that I will put it in the fridge and make it a dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality in which I don't buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and that meat be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
These crap that when something is cheap must certainly be wrong, spoiled or of poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth; -)
The Germans elected Keller to the head of the football association
Fritz Keller, the current head of Bundesliga Freiburg, became the new chairman of the German Football Association. The 62-year-old wine, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he had no opponents.
In the position, Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned due to an affair with undeclared income in April. His other predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach will again go to court for possible bribery in the bid to organize the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals will be to restore confidence in the union and lead it out of crisis. "It will not be any one Man Show, many people will be responsible. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together we can do so.
After being elected head of the union, Keller left office in Freiburg.
The Děčín Zoo is happy to be from a small macaque
"Our troop currently has seven members. Her youngest member came to the world on August 17, the female Buffy gave birth to him and she is her fifth child, the father is the male Hitam. However, the first days after birth, the female carried a cub tightly pressed to her body and for a long time did not want to show to the world whether a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the cub began gradually to put him down for a short while, and the keepers already know for a few days that it was a zoo spokeswoman for this species, Alena Houšková said that she had already bred a cub from this species.
Crested macaques are the so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. The typical feature is the black coat and crest on the head, according to which they have the name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The menu is dominated by very distinctive fruits of forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. The need for protein is resolved by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"If we leave aside the natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for their fur. Burning and cutting down the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," added the spokeswoman.

Přerov: The driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
There was a tragic traffic accident on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the Fabia driver did not manage to drive there and drove off the road. The car flipped onto the roof and he remained wedged underneath it. He did not survive the injuries.
"According to the initial information found on the spot, a passenger vehicle traveling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned onto the roof and the driver was wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told novinky.cz.
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies distributed some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about god, I was confused, but I suspected it would be a kind of propaganda.
After reading, I found who released it and finally Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good matchos, full of completely useless lessons, as I have to be wrong and not to be a PiCUS.
It's a waste of paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to cut down.
I experienced something similar with a former girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with this person because you like him without realizing how much there is in the situation.
She threatened me several times due to the fact that I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
And also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she was terrified and begged me not to go anywhere on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then it took another six months and she was started to fight for a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship with telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch a amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously cutting down here by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positive ones that wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we do is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees being put under house arrest for five days in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped with that cloud and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I'm looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, the MLM recruiting is again returning to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises of product and business skills training quickly turned into "you may not be interested, especially among people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make people talk.
When the first money made came, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to pitch a few certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, or you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump to every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't put everyone in one bag.
There are people who are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Sándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. During the week, the media speculated that the army planned a bombastic farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the family, as only soldiers can do. There were discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, denied it.
"It's nonsense! We've been in contact with the family from the beginning, the agreed Friday funeral date has been valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honors apply. We'll just deal with any possible participation of the media in consideration of the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place really on Friday and it will not include all military honors, including flyover of fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere surrounding the last farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who worked with the general in the past!
For example, this is the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Sándor remembers his former colleague as a hardworking, intelligent and "good guy".
In addition, he regularly met him in recent years to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That's why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to Milan Jakubů's funeral," said Blesk Sándor. But he can't.
"I also know about other people from an organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because they are looking for potentates for the funeral for themselves. I think it's not right to privatize the funeral this way," said a security expert. He is not even playing the supposedly considered closure of the ceremony for the public due to the secrecy of army conspirators.
"The leadership of the army is not secret, and not too, the leaders of military intelligence, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the information of the media is true and the family really let the army back up, it is of course a matter of course a family. I personally would never admit that the army overcomes the family and its wishes," Sándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision between Milan Rapid and Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the sports car driver Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer should have entered the opposite direction in the corner, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences by the end of her life. The police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Entry to Czechs and children is prohibited. ČOI revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation about prices and failure to comply with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, the restaurant in Prague refuses to allow smaller children to enter the company. According to ČOI, on its website, according to ČOI, the establishment is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "The employee of the restaurant replied electronically that the restaurant does not accept the presence of children in the restaurant," added Fröhlich.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to allow Czech-speaking people to go to the table, while English-speaking people allowed it. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," ČOI described the situation.
Both cases are now being resolved in administrative proceedings. Since they are not yet legally terminated, the inspector's spokesman could not provide detailed information about the mentioned restaurants.
However, discrimination appeared only in a very small part of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, COI carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the mentioned two cases of discrimination, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. These were mostly deficiencies in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, there were already legal fines of 60,000 crowns.
I haven't experienced many such things in a company where I work.
HR is calm, managers look after their own management and don't poke our noses into anything.
So regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it works quite a bit for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we'll look at what worked out and what not) - it's more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that we are such a near-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't bother us very much as long as there are results.

The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 mandates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.

The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03: 49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Collection of Laws after approval.
Whether the fans are positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta is awaiting a straw in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of the possibility, we will do everything in our power to succeed. In order to win the game and results," Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club TV.
In the week, the goal was decided by a cup duel in Jihlava (2-1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was an obligation for her. She was relieved, but the game is still suffering.
Even though the season is slowly flowing to the other third, football Sparta is still looking for a face that coach Václav Jílek talked about will reduce his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, which has very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans last arrived in Štruncový sady, it was a definite matter in the superstructure in mid-May. The guests went after a heartless performance run with a 0-4 beating, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While at that time there was an eight-point difference between the clubs in the table before the mutual match, Sparta is now losing nine points after ten matches of the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst starts in the season ever.
"It's not a simple situation either for us or for fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like us to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta doesn't know if Tetteh will be able to use it in Pilsen, which he received a two-game suspension for being sent off in Pilsen, but appealed to him on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen from 2011, remain among the many dead.
Home, who, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, have won the last five matches, only midfielder Čermák should come together. And defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan native, should lead them into the match as captain.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV. exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech king Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and on Saturday by people in Prague's Klementin. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare rare originals in the display cases in the Chapel of Mirrors. Entrance to the exhibition is free, it is open from 00: 00 a.m. to 6: 00 p.m.
An exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandate domini Regis: From the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV. the library prepared together with the National Archives. The National Archives looks at the written heritage from the time of government of Wenceslas IV. from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said to the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is essentially a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, i.e. a prayer book of one of the Benedictine nuns of the St. George Monastery at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he listed the reasons why people should see the exhibition according to him.
Epistles of Peter of Blois will also be displayed, where the opening miniature H (encumbrances) is depicted. The author of the decorations is, most likely, Master Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Bible of Wenceslas IV. also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin treatise by John Wycliffe from about 1111 to 441
From the library of Wenceslas IV. there was not a single book on Czech territory. According to experts, this library belonged to the most extensive and also the most beautiful collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library that would equalize the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library disappeared soon after Václav's death. According to him, it was stolen or destroyed during the capture of the Hussite Castle by several codices, but it was saved by Austrians own most of them today.
"We have a lot of treasures in our collections and I am happy that they are in a condition that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of a digital library of Manuscriptorium," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On the day of Saturday's state holiday, an exhibition called What's hiding under the floor, which represents local archaeological discoveries, will be open for free in Klementin.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that here we have a quite dangerous contagious disease took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its strata is, I have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to him I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be rid of the position of president and the ability to acquire it again.
However, the chance that this really occurs is very small, as the others mentioned here.
Moreover, I am not sure if shredding the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is such an act that the president of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: There is increasing number of people under 35 who are without sex for a year
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religiously based people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex life increased from 8 to 21 percent.
There are more than ever women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in recent years.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has risen rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them said they had been without sex in recent years.
It was 29% for single people. Stone added that married under 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married people under the age of 35 is still falling.
Young people divided the opinion of premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's fine.
"It is true that they are a minority between singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving this trend," Stone says of these 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate has risen from 20 to almost 60% for single people under the age of 35 who have been participating in religious meetings more than once a month.
Among the "less religious", the trend rose from 10 to 20%, "Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing this need".
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm it
"So it turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finances than the reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly larger share of the wrong answers," said KRUK Director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or university students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn about the functioning of financial matters most from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third place from school education (21 percent).
Mainly women consult their parents about financial issues, while men are rather looking for information on the Internet. Getting financial information from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of the upbringing of their parents' children, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. That is why the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key," said Palendalová.
94 percent of young people prefer savings and investments.
Young people are clearly concerned with whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or apartment, or to enjoy and rather spend money, without saving and owning your own home.
The strategy of savings and investment in long-term tangible assets is recognized by 94 percent of those interviewed. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current level of personal income.
The survey strategy is then 100% supported by married people with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the other hand, people living alone and with an income of more than 30,000 crowns per month want to enjoy themselves.
The whole order for vaccination against covids is about whether the company should force a part of the population to behavior that they don't want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which I personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
I.e., for example, the question of whether if we don't recommend it to them and they die will be our fault.
My argument is that we certainly could for the death of a 80-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can, for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, is talking about bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly deduced that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do so themselves.
Brno Grand Prix? Are ticket prices at risk?
The most expensive item is the registration fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about 105 million crowns. "The mass of people who will come to Brno at the Grand Prix will spend money there for accommodation, food and entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," assessed economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno doesn't have as many of the world's tourist attractions. The grand prix attracts visitors from abroad there. For Brno is as important as, for example, Turan airport or exhibition center. And these are projects that are supported by public money," added the economist.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs in the past five years: 686 million crowns
- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns
- problem: Lack of money for organizing, increasing registration fee for promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: More money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: Negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is beneficial for Brno. "The Grand Prix siphons money from public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent, it is a political and not an economic issue," he thinks.
In the future, however, the costs of a motoring event may be even higher. The game has a possibility of increasing the registration fee to almost twice.
"The situation is not closed, we have to try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst scenarios come true, I am afraid it is not realistic for the city and region to pay the amount," admitted Brno mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prize. "Dorna's condition is that the advertisement must be placed in places that do not have cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in future years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adapt the revaluation to this," said Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around so far, says Jan Cina
"That was a great school for everyone who did it. I fell in love with Afro dance there. As I have something Romani in me from my dad, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the series První krok in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter had to tempted him a lot. "The work was demanding, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot of filming was also done in the Southern Town in Prague," said to the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for a Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it to be the top of my career. "I don't feel this way." I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I only see the peak far ahead of me, "he revealed, saying that he did not even think about the thanked speech in case of victory. Not, but as a child when I listened to talk shows on the radio as always imagined myself talking to people.
Jan Cina has been living with colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "He like each other and perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed and remembered the awarding of Czech Lions when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He also had new slippery shoes and a red carpet was slippery. So he didn't take long and was lying on the ground. He was able to make it priority. He had a workshop called Vančura Stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down stairs at VIP events."
Costa Rica is the champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. In order to begin with, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2,050 - however, many countries have committed to this in the framework of the Paris Agreement. The Central American country, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of global emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to go fully renewable energy by 2003, while 70 percent of buses or taxis should run on electricity.
The official tourism organization states that already about 95 percent of renewable energy comes from them - in 2017, Costa Rica has been operating on them for a total of 30 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot considering the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rain or cloud forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Czechia without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter has so far brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské 50.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I should have one story, but it's not a pan-girls.
Once in the middle, the teacher led us across the city to the shipyard, so we can ride on boats along the river.
On the way there, we walked along one such rather wide street and who we probably don't see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they met with us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but one friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we also asked her and the teacher what she was saying to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I had no soul, "she replied.
All, including a teacher, we laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
There is not much happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Matěusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is beneficial, using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the "Normandy group" bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor informed the chancellor of a situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record 100 attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He discussed other sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in a dispute with Belarus, and condemned Lukashenko's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Vandal damaged the cemetery in Dobruška
According to the report received by the police, vandalism on a scattering meadow inside the Dobruš cemetery should have happened on Wednesday between 1 pm and 5 pm.
"The material damage was estimated at 60,000 crowns. The police ask potential witnesses to the event to report their findings personally on the official or by phone on the free line 158," said police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná.
Criminal investigators are investigating the case as damage to a foreign item and disorderly conduct, for which up to three-year prison sentence threatens.
Drunken Polish nuns blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was managed by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When police told her that she could still lose a driver's license from the scene of the accident, she went out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came to their sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took her driver's license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess her actions in court.
The Slovaks succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded with reference to the closure of the stadium for racism of the fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualification match with Wales without spectators, instead, the union will now only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behavior of the fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting ward of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. The stadium closed to both associations for one match, and Slovakia fined 20,000 euros, Hungary 67,000 euros.
After appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15,000 euros for insulting political shouts. The next match of the national team in qualifying for the European Championship against Wales on October 10 in Trnava will thus be made available to the fans.
Destroyed shops, fires on the streets, commemorative processions were accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of the university in Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigation, so far the case has not been clarified. Allegedly, students should have been detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, but according to the investigation, according to the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial procession took place in the Mexican capital on Thursday, families wanted to express their frustration at the continued failure to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
However, the largely peaceful march was disturbed by smaller groups of vandals, which destroyed everything they had done on their way. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, nor was it possible to destroy monuments, they set fires around the city and drank windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to catch him, and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but not one of them was able to be condemned. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly should have tortured suspects, APTN adds.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing about it: The laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce Gump's cheesy film - a dog that taught people to live, another film Tady we are now looking after audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film Tady Hlídám ja from 2012.
A talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owner of the boarding house in Šumava, who is dying, so dog handlers, Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika, will start inviting him to it.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also a film producer) struggled with the storytelling process already in the previous dog film, but at least children and a dog had fun there.
This time, the creators of the pair wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child and if a proper "constellation" comes true, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, despite years of training), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite her own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which a family takes her to the hospital to the heart of the miraculous healing process.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content PelMel full of implausible situations and figures were needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog competition, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving at a tip-off to look for "drugs" and discussing the fertilizing power of bone meal over herbs - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and immediately sits curled and pours with a cigar at the family table and demands father's whiskey and flambés as a cured vegetarian, it can't be laughed.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after the coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for characters' characters and points of view and directorial leadership.
The acting performance is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
However, Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková and Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they have nothing to play.
The only plus point of the film is the poetic footage of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshund.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, flimsy plot and dog talk, let alone the more popular profanity that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long-time membership in the Dachshund Breeders' Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of a person with a dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse exactly from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer if he is not, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such KIDy furt, you may change your opinion.
It's a job like any other, in which case a part-time job for extra income.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of the hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, it should be decided by the end of September.
According to Jan Pope, the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Pope, there are three variants of possible solutions - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which of them can't be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told ČTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, ČK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own money, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. According to Pope, ČK promised its clients to pay payments, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases when the local hotel kicked out all tourists of the office. "The hotelier was not able to determine who belongs to the German and who belongs to the Czech company. He threw everyone out of the hotel even though domestic Neckermann provided a guarantee," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its sales last year to 995 million crowns, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the other hand, the company's net profit decreased by about seven million to 15.3 million crowns. However, from previous years, the company has remained unpaid loss of almost 10 million. On the other hand, the branch of two basic divisions - in addition to CK Travel Lufthansa is Neckermann Center.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"Such a complete absence of precipitation during November, as we saw at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
That's why the two-day rain this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
She didn't rain here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is abrupt and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
They dry out without them and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to three last rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water has warned against drought for a long time.
"It can be expected that precipitation here may decrease depending on global warming and climate change," predicted Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israel Water Management Authority in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tanker trucks on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to two previous years," tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has the driest November in many recent years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel's defense minister said that negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and that he informed Washington of preparations for attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians will play with them".

About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
Finally, I discovered that my suspicion of a pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these fakes, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.

The imitation of a normalization room with a TV showing footage of the brutal police intervention against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also at the new exhibition of the museum in Semile, which is devoted to the velvet revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in the hearing after the events on Národní třída," said exhibition curator Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, saying that there was the first demonstration on November 22 in Semily, and then every day more people were gradually arriving," he said. From the beginning, one of the most active was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečkovy, who circulated the Several Sentences petition relatively quickly according to Chvátal, one specific curator of the Civic Forum was also created. There was a strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum.
About 50 photographs should draw visitors into the happening at the time in the city, 30 years ago taken by Karel Bárta. There should also be a video from a general strike filmed by František Tomíček on November 27, 1989, which will be released in the loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration at the time. The Semil archive borrowed the exhibition a number of preserved banners at the time, "said Chvátalíčová in December, adding that the name of the city would not be used to be used to be drunk, for example," let's say: "Let's not be drunk in December," let's say, some changes in the city have been made to the city.
The exhibition also shows what happened before November's events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the then museum of the workers' movement," Chvátal said. One room should just make a sense of how it could have looked in the living room at the time.
The last part of the exhibition is dedicated to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who experienced it will remember us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the OF banner with a beautiful motto Everyone for his community," added the curator.

Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, plenty of snow and nice weather awaited them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas started operations thanks to that.
Skiers were also not deterred by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While the staff do not complain about the interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were blessed with the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are happy, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the interest of the director of the Ještědáakub Hanuš Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná in Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, on Saturday and today, an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not bear the praise of the representative of the ski center in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after experiencing covid-19 disease.
On the other hand, people are ready for it and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in recent years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of Snowbear Hradec Králové company, also feels that due to covid there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
This time before the pandemic, we were already almost halfway through.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people got angry with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested have to order them in advance.
"We start renting cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest in a ski school is also comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich to not go abroad, it must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a doctor of specialists.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company will not just go abroad.
But completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started in such a way that Orbán won one beautiful day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
Another question is elections at all.
If she lives crazy here, some traditional V4 maniac can also win here.
Its supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain young and educated.
Horrifying photo!
Langmajer in blood due to a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor published a photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srncová worked said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7: 45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
On December 3, one of their co-workers reported her disappearance.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petr, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who could have any information that could help it find to contact the police," the communication continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová also calls on the public to cooperate, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably settled to death," she said in Labor politician, holding a photo of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family and worked here for our healthcare," Harmanová said.
The police have previously arrested one man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like this either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are revoking the threat of Invasion and began to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has GDP Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That's all, and that would correspond to the "concentration" at the borders.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables, mainly suburban connections, apply in Prague from Sunday
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) have been seeing several changes from Sunday, especially related to suburban connections.
New lines arose, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
Since Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains will run on the route from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through Prague's main railway station.
In the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station, the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will newly stop.
The PID will newly expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Starý Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Regions.
77 lines will be repealed, 37 new lines will be introduced and traffic will be adjusted on 12 working ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague's Zličín, which will go to Žatec.
A new direct connection Prague – Královovice u Rakovníka was also created, replacing the canceled S53 train line.

Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, is newly canceled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02: 30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or a section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended, following from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
Changes were made to the routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk and the routes of some buses to the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen region are modified.

A healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I don't have the power to exercise, I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at high speed I will buy pizza buns and a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately it's the case.
And these are not trees that you must always see.
Only the tip of the trees can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that this is the only reason why they ban us from riding off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confession of Dara about her relationship with Nedvěd: I didn't look forward to that at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, even because of the singer, the famous football player has been able to divorce.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to the fans in which she explains why she hid love from them for half a year.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěda," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to her ears.
But he packed her, not the other way around.
They are the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen once, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If those who are not interested in it at all, it also makes it stand out from them from the can, or we, whose lives they hand over to each other in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match to each other, or if you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
After all, that's a joke, you want it, bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there again for a long time as the vice-chairman of the Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth only now that they were waiting to conclude Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are only three weeks in paper.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us for it.
We are only people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man and as he stands by me, I stand by him. Rollins concluded in good and in bad, as he stands by me.
Opening Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrod Region) - The estate in Nová Ves u Leštiny in the Havlíčkobrod region opened Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations made up of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins dominate the garden with a huge orange pyramids. Autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins of the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipka family betrayed the fields for longer. There are still a lot of them today, said Jaroslava Pipková.
The Pipks grow many kinds of pumpkins, but the weather hasn't been working for them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some species did not come out. "We have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some varieties for connoisseurs did not succeed," said Pipková. Nevertheless, you can choose from several types on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and gouging decorations to cooking pumpkins or elongated spaghetti "pumpkins of various colors to decorative pumpkins.
Growing pumpkins is hard work. Farmers dig up the plants and harvest their fruits, cutting pumpkins from the stem with scissors. Pumpkins open to Pipkovy from 2010, thousands of people have attracted previous editions. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3rd.
Details about the event are on the farm's website, where the growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other options for preparing pumpkin in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, we too, we are inspired by it," said Pipková. She pointed out that some housewives also treat pumpkins like pickles.

Hi, the other commenters probably have already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised very long before, so you probably won't find it very well now, but look at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejlů, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and in this direction it's fine, in addition it's close to most of the faculties of BUT (I don't know where exactly you're going).
So I've never looked for a lease, but I'm a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need some information:)
But that's an example of a completely "normal" thinking.
Due to what several doctors somewhere decided to do in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not fund some schools enough.
Either whether they are learning what they want and paying for it from their own or whether they are traveling according to the state and paid by the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because a few crowns will happen to a full state contribution and thanks to that, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed this about a five-day action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a voice against anyone going to abortion is the same for you as a voice against a statue standing on the square?
Neckermann cancels all years, it affects five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the commercial name Neckermann Travel agency, did not filed an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect approximately 500 clients. According to him, the 800 clients of Neckermann who are currently abroad will "be taken care of and a safe return to the Czech Republic is ensured by their planned flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the ČK Neckermann SOS line," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook's collapse happened on Monday. At the same time, in August of this year, the travel agency concluded an agreement on the basis of which creditors were to invest 90 million pounds in the company.
Half of the amount should have been received from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. Based on that, it should have become the majority owner. The other half should have been provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as of September 20, it was reported that creditors demanded the travel agency to raise a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the agreement falls. On Monday, the company announced that it had bankrupted.
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing / digitizing that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it from the eye, or write something like xxx * * * or... (according to convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it seems that you are pulling it out of a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own mark, which sits on the coin.
PS: Isn't it the Odrysian kingdom (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: Someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with "
Politicians do not even know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood any text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that, that is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, it is quite interesting with that English, after the withdrawal of the GB from the EU.
Trump is considering revoking Chinese stocks to register in the US
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking permission for Chinese companies to trade stock markets in the United States. This is said by an informed source to Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the report and dragging the entire market together.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to limit US investment in China, the source added. He thus confirmed the report of the Bloomberg agency, which shortly before caused a shock on the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIY lost between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg pointed out that an exact mechanism has not yet been developed to secure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from US exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, but he gave negotiations on this matter green light.
China and the US have been waging a trade war that has been imposing tariffs on each other for more than a year. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises concerns about the recession of the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus in the US.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China should resume on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not at risk, reports the Kremlin. However, the game has a change of operator
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a back-up plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract is legally cancelled. In addition, the state is preparing another provisional solution if the tender didn't complete on time. On Facebook, transport minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) said.
The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of a toll contract between the state and the CzechToll / SkyToll consortium on Thursday, with an annual postponement. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of a new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting to prepare a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of a new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," said.
The state would thus look in the tender for the operator of the toll currently being prepared, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new system, as was the case with the last tender, nor for the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be possible to prepare the new tender on time. "Based on previous experience in the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the ÚOHS is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a difficult procurement procedure and hand over the operation of the system to a new operator within the period set by it for 12 months," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the collection of tolls for a temporary period until the state finds a full-fledged solution.
The state apparently does not yet use the offer submitted by the current toll manager Kapsch in recent days to him. The Austrian company of the state offered the operation of the existing system in the event that the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin repeated that it believes that the backup plan will not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.
The ÚOHS issued on Thursday, in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will only come into effect one year after the authority's decision becomes legal force. This is not valid and an appeal against it can be filed against the chairman of the office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year, the CzechToll / SkyToll consortium won the tender for the new toll system and its operator. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over 13 billion crowns.
"The horrifying result of the study." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable mistrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of Austrians fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand the introduction of a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favor of greater monitoring of centers of Islam.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country due to the presence of Muslims.
"The result of the study is horrifying," claims the author of the study, Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency to ethnocentrism could eventually lead to discriminatory attitudes. There is a danger that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer claims in Austria that it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to sociologists, dialogue and education could help blunt polarization.
According to a study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without university education or seniors over 75 years of age. On the other hand, Green voters, under 30 and university students are the most favorable.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of approximately 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There have been more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country and Islam has been officially recognized here as a religion since 1912.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I have been working there for the third year now and I'm totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 a.m. and never a problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has almost never advanced there in his life.
Yes, probably most of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't have it: D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go to it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who will they spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček was not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light up.
I saw Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist Blesk, confirming Patrasová that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where it will be at Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together AGAIN!
But we still talked about something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dade and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I will always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet the wife of Luděk Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
"A travesty of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Between 2011 and 2015, Sik participated with other scientists in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health. It concluded that water, land and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country is related to the increased incidence of cancer in local residents.
The scientists mentioned mainly the Dilovasi industrial zone, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer much more often than the international average.
Erdogan is revenge for a coup, international criticism despite
It seemed to Sika that despite the clear conclusions of the study, the government is not taking any action on the matter. He therefore wrote several articles about the research in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently started prosecuting him for divulging classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik said after the verdict was handed down to journalists. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that directly concern public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," added the scientist.
"Instead of persecuting people who are whistleblowing through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health issue," said Andrew Gardner from Turkish branch AI.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not implementing environmental regulations, despite rapid industrial development in certain regions.
After a failed coup in 2016, the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a massive wave of arrests. Almost 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet newspaper employees. The authorities have also placed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces out of service or completely dismissed.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using coup attempts to persecute their opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying these are the measures necessary to ensure national security.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor must be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I know no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in the crisis.
There are few policemen and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of people with healthy training at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is up to the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies must be changed, the landscape should not just be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going to undergo the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture have also been recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also intensifies the effects.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveler Zikmund or General Boček. The Senate distributed commemorative medals
Ninety-six-year-old Boček, who was a British Air Force fighter during World War II, thanked all recipients for their medals. "The Senate was one of the first that did not forget and remembers war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer among us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let's not forget our roots, which everyone wants or doesn't want us, unite and shape us. After all, our successful present is based on these values," said the Cubana.
The awards were the cardiology and the most quoted Czech scientist Renáta Čífková, the long-time chancellor of the University of Tomáš Baška in Zlín, the geologist, writer and traveler and popularist of science Václav Štěpák, the chairman of the Czech University of Tomáš Baška in Zlín, and the vice president of the World Biathlon Union, Jiří Hamza and František Pátek. The upper house appreciated his heroine - this January, he saved his neighbor's life and two-year-old grandsons, when they also won the medals from the burning car. The former chairman of the Benešová car was also won by Milan Štěpáníčová.
Together with Jiří Hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a number of documentary material. Fištejn was also a commentator and broadcast director of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with public media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and screenwriter, the musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission for supervising the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was received in advance by astronomer and emeritus head of the UN Office for Space Affairs Luboš Perek, in July on the occasion of his hundredth birthday. By the end of the year, Czech native and first US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia, are to receive the same award.
Harry in Princess Diana's footsteps (" 36)! Where is meghan?
Diana was exceptional that she could catch people behind her heart. In January 1997 she caused a stir when she visited Africa and especially minefields. Images on which she was wearing a protective suit and a face shield became iconic. Even then, no one could suspect that a few months later a princess of human hearts would last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry also scored when he went to the same place as she was 22 years old. He went to a demining site in Dirico, Angola, he also put on a special protective suit and looked very pensive at it. He certainly couldn't resist the memories of a beloved mother, whom he lost at only 13.
Harry had a speech on the spot where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which works to deforestation the fields and other explosive in the countries where the war took place. "The minefields are unexplained blows of war. By cleaning them, we can help the community find the peace with which it also comes to opportunities," he said and also appealed to save and preserve the wild nature and the local river as a source of water. After moving to the famous center of Sussex, this visit was made by the Duke of Sussex.
He did not forget to mention it even on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to be able to visit a place and a community that was so important to his mother, familiarize himself with their tireless mission and speak for all that (Diana) felt that they needed the most to be heard, although the problem wasn't just popular worldwide," Sussex Royal appeared in a post on the Instagram.
However, royal fans may be disappointed that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such a trip as memories of Diana. Both have a separate program from Wednesday to Harry, apparently for their protection. After all, taking a small baby into a minefield, he does not sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to jeopardize his beloved family at any cost.

Yes, that's going to be the way I barely keep my skates on the ice, the mushrooms I know what it's like to play hockey and the tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total mess.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who are listening to what they notice, what the referees do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the opposite, it's just as always, and that the Czech Republic lost more often with Russia than it won, it would probably be classic "they lost" vs "MY we won".
Failed qualifying. Czech athletes are not yet doing well in Doha
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped at a starting point of 800 meters, and pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková failed to qualify, defending the eighth place she surprised last year in London.
The start on Friday will be completed by hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw her in her third attempt of 65.46 meters and fell by almost six meters with her best this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, a limit of 460 cm should have been overcome.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only recently thanks to her invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run at the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2: 03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semi-finals. She fell short of one and a half seconds after her best this year. "It was quite fast, unfortunately I was fighting in the corner, unfortunately I had to be completely satisfied with my opponent, which was a little uncomfortable, but I had to be again satisfied with my strength from this year's strength." It was quite fast, unfortunately, I had to be completely satisfied with my opponent in the corner.
She was happy that she overtook at least one opponent in the finish line. "She really wasn't doing well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was fifth place for that. Unfortunately," she added. Winnie Nanyonda of Uganda was the fastest half-distance runner in the heats in 2: 00.36.
In Doha, Caster Semenya's best 800-year-old has been missing from South Africa, which has a very high level of testosterone in the body, but just like some other female runners, he refuses the treatment ordered by the IAAF rules since this year.
In the 100-meter races, the American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favorite, who was the only one to reach under ten seconds in a time of 9.98. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at the age of 37 is trying to defend his title, also advanced to the semi-finals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is with a performance of.8.66 this year's charts, did not start and expected his fight with Coleman, has a performance in this season.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría already showed a great form in the long distance qualification, who reached a distance of 840 cm by the first jump. No athlete in the WC qualification for the past 20 years has jumped so far. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's charts with a performance of 865 cm.
The Slovenians also defeated the Polish world champions and are in the finals of the EC
Slovenian volleyball players will play a sensational role in the prime minister's title of the European Champions. With the support of almost 12,000 rebelling fans in Ljubljana, they defeated the two-in-one world champions Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who is going to challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will definitely take place on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. These only had the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but home volleyball players excelled in defense and the players in the Red and White jersey, only the native of Cuba Leon scored points.
But in the home line-up, both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut and also the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the lackluster Gasparini, presented themselves in a life form. The Poles paid for winning all previous games in this Euro, while the Slovenians gaining confidence after tough play off battles with Bulgaria and Russia.
This August, the Slovenians lost 1-3 in the Olympic qualification in ", but they avenged their defeat at home. However, Stožica will now leave the sold Ljubljana arena. However, after today, they have a certain second medal in history, they can improve unexpected silver from the EC four years ago.
At the previous European championship, at the same time, the Slovenians finished eighth, only for the Czech national team.
Kind to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at a model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Department of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is otherwise not open to the public," advises national coordinator of the Night of Scientists Jitřen Navrátilová.
The Department of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissection room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would like to go to ČZÚ and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. The guided tours will also offer nine laboratories. This year's Night of Scientists' slogan is "planet-friendly".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic 100,000, 871 for 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, it is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omikron, said on Sunday on TV by Dr. Susan Hopkins, the main medical order for the British Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects them to increase.
So far, no one died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labor leader Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers participated in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is rising to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial ITV for Britain: Today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a vast majority two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing it from the position of Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because there were not even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of voter precincts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one is in such a way that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided precincts into those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was about not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
That's a great increase for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even more hard in order to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
She recently leaked a recording of the chairman of the parliament and one of Fidesz leaders, László Kövér, to independent media, where he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.

I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my mother's parents didn't have much patience, I'm not too, the dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely extremely hard (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely now have a tendency to solve things with violence as a child I quite wanted, now I'm going to get into something at least and, as a younger parent, I have been slapping over my hand for example (so that I don't get much over my handle), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I am not able to determine the extent to which it is my explosiveness, but certainly the education has its share in it too.
I am also afraid that I will lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it's probably not possible to at least a little bit of a child seams, so I don't blame them for that.
It doesn't make me feel very vague, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call kundas those that the laws create in such a quality.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can people really count on the fact that they want and buy the product and you will have something to pay for the mortgage?

Scientists are looking for toddlers with congenital defect, so-called ankle valgus, for their study
Ankle valgus is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. Usually, intensive exercise is treated. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so special shoes should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis in order to map the effect in both groups. At the same time, participating in the research will not have any risks and measurement will be completely painless for children," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research from the Faculty of Sports Studies of MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website where a registration form and all information are available.
The scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Half of each group will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is the moment when they start taking their first independent steps, typically they start, for example, the furniture they are holding when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, for half of the participants it also includes wearing tested shoes," points out Gimunová.
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of four accused of murder by Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
She was mobilized by civil society, but she also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges the Hradec defender Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play against where he recently worked in Friday's game. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates, although they have never worn the shirt of Prague club.
"Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta," says the defender of Hradec Králové before the match of the 5th extra league round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend its series of wins in it, which at the moment includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came the most appreciated on Sunday, Mountfield got to neighboring Pardubice for him.
"But we can't look at the matches that were. We need to concentrate on the matches that await us now and play in them the same, if not better," points out the defender of Hradec Králové.
Hradec Králové should not even look back at last year's balance with Sparta. They lost in three out of four matches, taking points only once after victory in Prague after overtime. In addition, Sparta management brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta always had quality players, but what we will talk about is really charged this year," admits Nedomlel before the first match of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec?

How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the opponents of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released a day ago, two later?
Whereupon, they let themselves be fooled and the company rejected it.
Czech TV was dying with ČOVID even half a year ago.
Lucia Bílá's father didn't fix her at all. You won't believe what she should have been living for!
Who doesn't know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession seamstress and her name is Hana Zaňáková probably doesn't live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when she performed in a cultural center in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives, she was a little girl.
"And I will exactly remember where my mother was sitting. At that time, a singer was born in me," she admitted to Impuls radio.
However, her father was a little worried about her daughter's future and advised her to follow the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Keep your feet on the ground!' He even persuaded me if I wanted to go to the local glass factory. The glass factory no longer works, I'm quite well. I'm trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants made of beads, which I then auction and buy wheelchairs for money," she added with laugh.

Comment by Jan Šindelář: Managing your railways as a company
Heaven's election, although apparently not completely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give roads a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year and this has not changed even after Wednesday evening, because one of the members resigned. The provisional lasts.
The selection procedure itself was farce from the beginning, already because the requirements for candidates mainly in the field of practice were significantly eased. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have been reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board only played the role of pimps.
Nebeský probably presented the weakest professional resume from five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned already know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in a political game.
Maybe Nebesky will surprise, show great talent and finally prove to be the best lane boss ever. At least at the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political tabloids. České dráhy does not expect a lightweight period, they have to cope with competition in liberalizing the market and with a lack of employees in operation. Train drivers, shifters and mechanics are missing. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant china in top management?
Creditors are the second important group. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the railways next spring when they defend their rating. It is certain that they perceive instability. It is sad that someone else goes to Moody's agency for Czech Railways to defend the rating every year. The agency did not miss frequent changes in railway management and a political influence on the company, she criticized them already this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement is coining the slogan that the state must be managed as a company. For begin with, it would be enough if one large state-owned company was managed as a company, not as a state. České dráhy is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it were led by the best. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. Then we can forgive ourselves the antics with selection process.

The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is over and there is still no law to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste.
The legislative council of the government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government over years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from law a more significant strengthening of their options when deciding on storage, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, is set by municipalities in particular: The proposed extent of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of decision-making on the selection of a location for storage, is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be really effective if municipalities or the public can affect whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The submitted draft substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not really have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for storage.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the office or minister whose interest is to issue an permission decides.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
Co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which rents external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with lawyer Jan Zemank.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is to be almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek locality and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who simply pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities to state authorities in the search of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, I expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
For support, we also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage alone.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced fear of losing weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyles for years, doctors finally warned him.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted his new figure in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
There is a completely different person from the fatty from the sitcom Roseanne!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body caused the furniture to creak.
"I put everything in my mouth," said the actor in an interview for AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit on the spot anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it were some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, formal text and, for example, university text, I would probably look for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses to everything.
For example, the game like Dark Souls, etc. has several bosses, that Yes, so there is "boss" something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where bosses are, but the player can't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that?
And then there are mini bosses.
It's probably probably not even possible to translate boss in one word for that flat-rate, Czech and other languages don't solve it somehow (an interesting one is only Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent).
In short, it is generally significant for the story or game, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watching over the completion of some level or task.
And where are the viewers? Doha can't there be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, as athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the captivating atmosphere that prevails at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite you to the "largest sporting event in 2019". However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings," the organizers claim.
But that's too little.
The upper walkway of the Khalífa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colorful tarpaulins, on which the flags of 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar has already ventured into territory where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it has no deep roots.
Let's not be surprised that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for the ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari riyals, i.e. converted to almost 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal that uncovered parts of the stands are at least half full. Therefore, according to the sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, free tickets to migrants who work here as laborers and also to children are allegedly issued (although the organizers themselves deny it). Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF athletics association, can also comment positively: "Just as we can inspire the next generation.
Wealthy Qatar has won world handball and cycling championships in the past, after athletics it will come to terms with football in 2022. The financial offers of the oil power will always be lucrative for rich sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even though we approach it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we will not resist a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better - and for a different year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the entire scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation of a key Olympic season, which under normal circumstances would already have started in October.
Hopefully Qatar will at least make up for this with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. Is it 37 degrees right now? The area of the stadium artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly in the blocks, are also supposed to show TV viewers in detail what takes place in athletes in hundredths of a second before the starter's shot just after it?
The whole world is looking for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also joined.
The British police have been searching for missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště has been looking for since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
"We will share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues fear her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her
MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czechia before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks significantly increased last month with the approaching end of the year.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice had an invoice, this time it was called Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021... exe, "said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively searches for saved credentials that it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers' activity increases again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and in November security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still worth almost a fifth of all detection.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
Formbook most often contained the attachment of the file extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear as well.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
Security analysts for the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of the attack and in the Czech Republic have not had any major attack campaigns in recent months, record a significant decrease and decrease in activity.
Today's bunch of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and according to my experience of the demonstrators, I am not afraid to estimate around 10,000 people.
People filled the embankment and the bridge in the procession and the opposite embankment road.
That means that people really do a lot.
A unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to finding a common language.
Only the anti-vaxxers themselves, anti-maskers and so on would not be able to fulfill or pay such a large procession.
The actions of the association wanted the dog are growing in popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy disturbed.
Sometimes I have such an impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won't be a left-wing or center-right movement, bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to revaccinate every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action of scientists, which humanity is really proud of.
At the end of the foot, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev instructed Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement to assemble a new government from the November elections.
This has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has lasted since April, when the government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests last year.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking at?
From the "secretly" footage taken, there is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain during the weekend about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived is calling for information about children's hospital employees.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth police department where Srncová worked said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7: 45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
On December 3, one of their co-workers reported her disappearance.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nursing assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas hospital association.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petr, who is missing," said a group of medical facilities in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who could have any information that could help it find to contact the police," the communication continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms from Šumper (and also regional pirate councillors), reported that she violates copyright with her paintings.
But the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumper's rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
Magistrates referred to the complaints about the ŘSD that the road belongs to, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "resolve the situation intensively".
Microplastics reach the human intestines, the study confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been suspected several years. The team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl of the University of Vienna has published a study that proves the presence of microplastics in the human feces for the first time. Although the study is small, there are eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small plastic particles between 50 and 500 micrometers of plastic were found in the samples of all persons examined. None of them were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid marine fish wrapped in plastic bottles and food.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are created by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. That is why they only officially confirmed their entry into the human digestive system. Roughly 20 particles of stool per ten grams, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in it.
Of course, lay and scientific awareness suspect that it is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. "It is the first ever study of its kind and confirms what we have long thought. Now that we have evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate exactly what exactly means for Schwabl.
And so far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least stop its steep increase. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that three years of marine humanity will consume five million tons of ecosystems in the current pace than today it threatens the digestive systems of marine animals in about eight million bottles.
Some countries have already taken steps towards restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example - under the threat of draconian punishments - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering minor bans (well-known straw), the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, claim that such measures are nice but completely insufficient.
