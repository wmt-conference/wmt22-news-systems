The application will help equip workshops. For points earned by movement
To equip the woodworking workshop of the Hodonín Integrated School with new hand tools. This can now be done by all those who download the EPP Help with Movement application to their mobiles.
"With your movement, you collect points, which you then credit to the account of our project. You do not have to be a racing runner or cyclist, points are accumulated even if you go dog walk or shop, go for a walk or walk to work," said Eva Schmidová, director of the Hodonín school. The project became one of the most interesting of the huge number of other applications for the ČEZ Foundation. The app will only be active for one month.
The great return of the Czech underdog is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goaltender of Litvínov, Pilsen and Chelyabinsk in Russia was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he alternated and since then he has not appeared on the NHL rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower body injury," the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He made 94.5% of his saves in the AHL.
The Pilsen hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and didn't play a single game in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL ,Francík played 36 games, his success rate of saves is 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's mask on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas card.
Prince Charles also made his wish public, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported on its website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt, as are Princes George and Louis.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot race in June.
Charles, who wears a cylinder on his head and a face mask, helps Camille put on her face mask in color matching her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case reportedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns from Slavia in Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz reported that he had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice Club, said that the Red and White did not commit any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly involved in its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red and white was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminologists reportedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 sk slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should be promised a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file does not indicate whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opponent's alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, we have never sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was unleashed last year in mid-October by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football positions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The guns will be of a new, but basically worse type (artillerymen must leave the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, we have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - Cold War, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith did not aggravate the criticism
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will face his younger version in the film. According to critics, however, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is at the very top of his field. It kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang his career on the nail. This, of course, does not please his employers, who send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or more precisely, his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined person win the fight over himself? This time literally.
A certain guarantee of quality was supposed to be three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. This is his first sci-fi, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tiger and dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the hugely successful Game of Thrones. According to the first responses, however, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to elevate it," said Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum total of all the talent involved. Only the technological magic of the filmmakers holds the weak script and plot together," said Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an incredibly elusive action movie," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"A confused product that came up with a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summarized the film in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is another's double when neither behaves like a human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria climbed from the river and did damage to crops, so I was seated there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down calmly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went in a moment.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, he was gone.
That is, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a confluence of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermovision, which almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, dear things put to your feet in the spacak and you should be fine.

The Interior got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts for the respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature-length documentary film
This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about his life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! To shoot with a man who has endured more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immense diligence was and is a great honor for me. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, whose art has brought joy to three generations of listeners, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first shooting day took place on October 22 last year and the last shots with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to authentically capture Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself away to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy with his songs to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has made a mark on the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not meant to be a showcase of the indisputable glory of Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with this current one. Everyone is different. At least by the fact that we filmed them in another stage of Karel Gott's life, and this will be very evident in his personal, almost intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed all of us in what legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time that is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to karel Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her narrow team in such a way that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics that were quite intimate. She and her husband, cinematographer Jan Malíř, actually became part of our family. Originally, we wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But because I had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my fans and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of čsla, which were experienced by older generations), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from compulsory military service.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that the trained could take, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the abilities of reservists will be rapidly lost in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas can be led and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will no longer be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
XXX Lutz can buy a competitor Kik, the authority allowed. But there's a catch.
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has authorised, subject to the fulfilment of structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition, the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it absorbed the Kika chain, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, they have to sell off part of the purchased company.
XLCEE-Holding also acquires Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the transaction must be authorised by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before being taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. It faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounts. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner has the brand Möbelix. Following the takeover of Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about CZK 114 billion).
Single children. We don't have a certain reproduction, but we don't have to scare
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. The word "only child" is one of them. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," it is said, without anything to add. Interestingly, this trait has been carried by the "only child" since ancient times, even from a time when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but European countries do not have a simple rate of reproduction of the population. (Within the West, only Israel stands out, with a combined fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. That is why it is not surprising when the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Maláčová also falls for him: "There are almost as many only children as two-child families," she said in an interview with LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good if the problem is highlighted instead of downplayed or ideologized. Like in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "so hitler supported it"). It is good to remember that many couples are planning only children. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the barriers that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak spread of teleworking discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let's draw attention to one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost as many only children", there is a drop of demagoguery in it. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). It then fell to a frightening 1.14 in 2000. But since then, it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above Europe's average. This is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with this alarmism can they take a little less.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. Buys 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social apartments that the city sold 15 years ago from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (CZK 23.8 billion). It responds to public pressure as it rebels against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition has criticized the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of apartments located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimates, the housing units overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to Germany's opposition liberal party (FDP), berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP tweeted this on Friday. The move was described as a "waste of money" by the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Already in mid-July, Gewobag acquired 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee Street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not disclosed by the council at that time. The dispute over the flats on the former exhibition avenue from the times of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper wrote.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. Rent prices have doubled over the past decade, according to AFP, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
mainly we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had him.
Then there is such a situation that you watch like a dude who did not hit an empty gate 2 minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and says to yourself "tvl and what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "watering down a defender" is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to outplay one of the opponent's players.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused her! Ended up in the institute
It was about nerves. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! Outside of the cameras, he allegedly had to suffer like this on a wooden mat for a foot massage! "Ondřej came to me after the shooting and told me - Auntie, I'm making these troubles and notes just so I wouldn't be here, because I want to go to the institute," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the door of the studio. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed for a month in the Educational Care Center in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then went to a diagnostic institute for problem children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately added me to Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I barely reacted to that at all. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in the institution, that then they returned him to them, now he is in the diagnostic center. They are both out of work," says mother Lucie from the Pilsen region.
Of course, Blesk also addressed the other side, but he received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta excused herself and hung up the phone.

Prague Stock Exchange Rose Slightly, Czech Banks, O2 and Avast Did Well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was driven up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the contrary, austrian titles and the media company CME did not fare well. This follows from the results of trading on the exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and finally ended with a small gain. "However, for the whole week it (PX index) lost slightly over one percent," said Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of recent days. Komerční banka rose by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to CZK 113 and O2 gained 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Less than one percent was then acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
Securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of CZK 520.
Three titles were loss-making - Erste Bank wrote down 0.87 percent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 percent to CZK 109 and insurance company VIG 0.40 percent to CZK 618.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four cents to CZK 25.85/EUR on the euro and three cents on the dollar to CZK 23.62/USD. This follows from the data on the server Patria Online.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major reversal for the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: a variant of omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
That being said, Merck's molnupiravir is the first to reach domestic patients.
The company ended up on tape first also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking "how our beak grew".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will unceremoniously tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their jobs and lynching the media.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the survey.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables to open Be2Can
The Golden Bear and both winners of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the Directing Award and the Jury Prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, too, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and inspiring things presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly won the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar contender. The pre-premiere of the film in Prague will be personally presented by the representatives of the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-writer of the film.
This year, Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art Cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
Director Ladj Ly's feature debut was screened and awarded at a number of other world festivals after its success at Cannes. At the Durban IFF it won the Best Film Award and the Best Screenplay Award, it was also screened at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo IFF and will soon be screened in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, however, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, The Disruptor of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We Didn't Catch You, The Anthology of ghost town and the film At the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to the Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of The Painted Bird.
We even know that the objects are three in the Czech Republic and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to learn again where what is, so all objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of security or speed of deployment of warheads due to a more western location.
In those underground shelters (in each maple there are two) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the Memorial to the September 11, 2001 Ground Zero terrorist attacks in New York on September 27, 2019.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all the states of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today at the New York Memorial to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honoured the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," the prime minister said when, accompanied by his wife Monika, he placed a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak émigré Alena Sešínová. Both were among more than 2750 deaths sustained by a hijacked plane attack on a former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The towers of the World Trade Center collapsed after the impact, in their place there is now a monument with a list of names of victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babis said. The attack on the US on September 11, 2001, was cited by the Prime Minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the World Trade Center skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the Defense Department building in Washington and planned to strike another target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. However, the plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech prime minister added.
At the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he was often too expressive, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he walked regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkeys, but he was fine, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same grade, a different class.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called a month later that he had already rewritten it on himself.
I say for myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (they work, they work, they don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But as soon as someone comes, stretches out his hand, occupies apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble. so it doesn't matter what color it is, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian paramedics, told Pravo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for as yet undetermined reasons drove into the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice, Fajtlová said.
She added that the man in the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post office is often free," says the collector.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he now has to add VAT and hand over customs data to the post office.
He receives an e-mail informing him that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will assess it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
If the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, there is also a problem that people do not respond to calls to deliver the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about half here, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Strict but fair, we enjoy the lessons! This is how the Benešov grammar school students see their favourite cantor writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, novelist and revivalist of literary life in a small town.
Above Pavel Hoza's texts, Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, quivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been following them for centuries. Grieving, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynek teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs the equivalent of prague's Viola in the local Café na slovíčko and annually organizes the Benešov Literary Festival.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to rise further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
This year they added 2% in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run while working.
Which cities disappear under the sea?
A vote by the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed a well-known rumor for days: Canada is withdrawing honorary citizenship from former human rights legend Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her part in the genocide against the minority nation of the Rohingya.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," independent senator Ratna Omidvar said. "We need to make it clear that accomplices to genocide are not welcome here in Canada – much less as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The longtime human rights activist's silence on the atrocities that the army of buddhist-majority Myanmar has been committing against the Rohingya Muslim minority for endless months is intolerable.
The fact that officially organised genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens, was recently revealed in a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, as the report says, "shock both by the horror of their actions and by their enormous scale." According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her led administration committed complicity primarily by covering up the actions of the soldiers and unleashing a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".
Following Suu Kyi's removal, five personalities remain on canada's list of honorary citizens: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49th Imam of Shia Muslims and Malala Yousafzai.
The development around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy was also reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where Suu Kyi's profile added information about the atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take away her title as an honorary citizen. "We have also muted the light on her photo on a timeline of the fight for human rights and are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesman Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain in the current upheaval of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for his huge contribution to the struggle for democracy. "While Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten told CBS Canada.

Prosecutor General Resumes Prosecution of Mother Who Manipulated Daughter Against Father
Prosecutor General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of a mother who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, such conduct can be considered a criminal offence.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can also be considered necessary from the point of view of directing further application practice," Zeman's appeal states.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of abusing the person in charge and endangering the upbringing of a child. She formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation affected the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened self-harm if she was placed in the care of her father.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to rule again.
The Regional Court stated that situations where one of the parents manipulates a child towards the other are not exceptional. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only rarely is criminal law the solution.
However, according to the Attorney General, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused acted quite purposefully, instilling negative feelings in her daughter towards her father, and purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. By such conduct, she not only pursued an unlawful intention to limit or exclude contact between the father and the minor, but she must have been aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court once again. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.

Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are only sent to prison for 6 months?
This just doesn't bother me how a court can only send such an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won't this also deter potential future reports of rape victims?
The first Miss Christ finally went into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately looked through
The first modern miss from 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had problems with excess weight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly psychological ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took those reproaches to heart and went into battle with the excess pounds. Even if it's a long run.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But thirty years have passed since then and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of her fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to strict modeling rules, which dictated that she was as slim as possible and often did not eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she wanted.
But she went from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately affected her figure. She tried to disguise the extra kilos with various loose clothing, which added to the loose shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went into herself. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone present at the launch of Miloš Zapletal's book (75) that she had seen through again and already had back the features of a charming brunette who entered history in 1989 not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory provoked.
Christová will forever be the first winner of beauty, but also the very first one that the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistled at as if stripped of her senses when she put on her crown.
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has postponed by three weeks the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí. The original opening date of the envelopes was September 20, national park spokesman Radek Drahný said. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is to reduce the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price that we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, the work will begin as much as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of repairs to the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Administration, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not endangered.
The KRNAP administration is unable to select a construction company for the museum's repairs. The second competition was announced this summer, because in the previous tender all the offers of the companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. Offers exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exposition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. A KRNAP visitor centre should be established in the currently vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibitions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway to the Giant Mountains for visitors. The Visitor Centre should provide the most comprehensible information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theater performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a café.
A man from the Grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
The man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He himself summoned them to her.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "robbed" told them that he had made everything up so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identities of the man and his girlfriend, officers found that the woman was on a wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer Slavs ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit is not to be punished
Unsolved cases are called "monuments" in criminological slang. But even these are investigated if new information emerges years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminologist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley, which was 12 years old at the time. "A case from 1955? This is going to be hard, very hard. It would like to find the file for a start, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," markovic said.
Under the previous regime, the public was not very informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 50s of the 20th century can be destroyed, although unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Tech companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama was somewhat tarnished by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, the political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point of the ideological development of mankind and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather seeing illiberal models prevail from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thrive. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to counterbalance these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he rethinks many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be returned to the public space, and Marx was right about many things. Although at the same time he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the nineties and critics allegedly did not understand the End of History and the Last Man correctly.
"What I was saying back then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracy doesn't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, do not see the meaning, and therefore group into groups according to identity, which give them a sense of belonging."
In its time, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against the Marxists, who saw communism as the final stage of history. When asked how Fukuyama now perceives the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about the ownership of the means of production, then except when clear services to the public are in demand, I do not think that will work. But if you mean redistribution programs that try to solve the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are witnessing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should. The long period launched by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are estimated, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should man then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god than Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to abstain from believing in any god than to risk making the wrong choice out of thousands of gods and the one real god I didn't hit send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
According to the spokesman of the office, Vladimír Řepka, the Ministry of Justice has received six requests in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The young man was imprisoned for two years for assaulting the woman, but the judiciary finally acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both the Prosecutor General Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the then twenty-year-old student of the Nečesaný grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by doctors of the Hradec Králové hospital.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I'm innocent and I swear by that. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he was in the hairdresser on that fateful day, told the court earlier. Apparently he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after his wife told him she was already closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later she identified Nečesaný as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court has successively handed down five judgments in the case. First, he found Nečesaný guilty twice and imposed 16 years in prison, while the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed, he gradually went to jail twice, but each time after the intervention of the Supreme Court he was released. After the ordered replacement of the bench, repeated acquittals were finally handed down, the last one being upheld by the High Court in March this year.
At the same time, the Chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, stated in the justification of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but given the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal verdict, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this is not that there is a lack of evidence, but its evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the pre-trial proceedings, which in another criminal case would have been sufficient for the admission of guilt," Lněnička said.
However, both the Hradec Court and the Supreme Court looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change further annulment of the acquittal.
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I think.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
All the components of the Army of the Czech Republic would like something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak as follows: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being rehashed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intermingling, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar blending should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader will never again invade here.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Well please the lord.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to cut their budget and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled vehicles, so what would not be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's these days, but a stubborn teenager behind the knob of a remote-controlled device can cope.
Kovosvit sells the administrative building and other halls. Expects worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, while consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Among the main problems last year, Kuchař ranks the lack of workers and shifts in subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools fell, by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decrease in turnover of the order of ten percent," the CEO said. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where of the five floors it uses two, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit and make its activities more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of a current solution, whether it is cash flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
Roughly half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Another order in the same volume is being negotiated, which we would like to fulfill by the end of the year," kuchař said. On the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor of Airbus. This May, it delivered another machine, one more at the end of the year or early 2020.
This year's main corporate investment was the transition from steam to hot water heating for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting cutters for the foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned by industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. At one time, the company had up to three thousand employees.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen will release his last album posthumously
The album Thank you for dance (Thanks for the Dance) will contain unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. In an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials his father had left behind. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or singer Beck.
"When we invented music for my father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he's always with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What amazes me most about him is the reaction of those who have heard him before. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his characteristic honey voice. He sang about death, he knew that he would not live to see the release of new material. He admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released his father's poetry collection called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen 31. december by argo publishing house.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unwrap gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the project map KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging carton has increased in price by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugstores and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvky u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electrical equipment, batteries, light sources, high-volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all the garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map contains over 100,000 such sites.
"Gradually, there are more collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection process. The law will be possible to circumvent, the opposition claims
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the opaque distribution of functions in the future - critics talk about newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, applicants should go through a selection procedure at the given ministry and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, it is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection committees are to blame for any wrong selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding on the Minister. The novelty has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
I rather find it wrong that nowadays technology is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, a problem has arisen (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo applications or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to use the technique from childhood, but most importantly let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, seriously
Ahead of the weekend, Emmanuel Macron unveiled the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be completed in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do voters.
Macron's supporters straddling the right and the left agree on little, but Europe does.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize macron for being pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has had quite a bit of success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a us versus them story and never as a whole story.
Spaniards, French, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being nachcípanej" A few days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
With influenza, I do not have diarrhea.
(Personal experience only. I don't think everybody has it that way)
Christmas Book Tips

Prose texts that follow on from the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unusual poetic mindfulness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of small town and Czech society.
A story about a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a desired illusion.
The Bohemist and comparative artist transports the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its presentation surpasses folk versions in brutality and escalates into a horror film about emotional emptiness.
And about the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we have become accustomed to listening to.
Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about each other to make for a life together.
Kristýna Plíšková did not make it to the final, she has so far missed her second title
Pliskova's environment in Tashkent was evident, in 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and this year she was very masterful.
After wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kuzmova, she made it into the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvancková did not go well for Kristýna. The Belgian kept her serve and broke Pliskova's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvancková soon took a 3-0 lead and Kristýna did not succeed in the reversal, although she managed to turn one brejkbol in the end. In the last one, she turned away one sword, but in the second came the end.
Ondřej Houska's Czechs in Europe: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
The undated image depicts Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies were involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have knocked the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly, it would not have been either of these weapons, although in them the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably have suffered the greatest losses – due to blisters.
Zeman as a conservationist - A man straining the constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who are in a divided society in the camp and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome situations when they do not have to cheer only for their own. When he can admit the pluses even to the one he otherwise criticizes. Already so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to pre-assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of heavily damaged monuments that President Zeman uses to fence during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what's going on. And those who occasionally wander through the Czech Republic see many of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagoguery can come into play here too. That if we reproach the town hall for not caring for monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "The section of the Heritage Act allows you to fine owners of buildings who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is unreachable, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the Constitution should recognize as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause, like squatters, whom he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the insults, the squatters draw attention to a problem beyond the current interest. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is doing the same thing.
When you come to the historical center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and thalers mining (dollars for Americans). Why? Supposedly because of the quick-fermented sale of houses in the 90s, local officials say. But why is it that seven kilometers away Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has the historical core nicely repaired? It is good if the President draws attention to these things.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or even slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to dispatch an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be daily.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic services under the new timetable, the railways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in Northern Moravia or West Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Daily, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned closure work, the carrier also tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
Carriers will also be exchanged on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they died.
I have never heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one is advocating this, only condemning it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one in school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't seen anyone deliberately conceal the facts, but I've heard it happen before and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
Rather, my point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in anyone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner, and a lot of things they also resented.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our point of view does not exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT where they turned out someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I found it appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them in this many times.
And when I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I feel a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young it is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism, for example, has long since achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists refer to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT and it leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even on quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more he is heard.
In conclusion, I also did not see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered bad geography, but that was a two-way :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be generally unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If there's one thing that connects me with people, it's interests, worldviews, and shared experiences, not where we were born.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police have charged aleš Pangrác, a former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, over advertising contracts. Pangrác confirmed to SeznamZprávy that he had taken over the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that police officers were reviewing contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. According to the police, part of the money was returned to Pangrác, the server reports. In the case, the criminologists were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), to whose ministry CzechTourism belongs. The investigation into the case is ongoing, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Centre against Organised Crime secured evidence in the case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodrom in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court search warrant for Dostálová, which was previously quoted by Czech Television, stated that in 2016, when she was a deputy minister, the minister decided on CzechTourism's expenses for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, did not err, can document everything and fully cooperates with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media previously reported that he was the former director of the Regional Partnership Department at CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This showed that CzechTourism had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment more on it," Pangrác told Seznam Zprávy.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, preparing the second generation of the Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was virtually no hydrogen refueling infrastructure in the world, it still put it on offer. Not quite standard, the customer had to really purposefully go after this car, but no one else offered such a variant at that time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced at hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is connected with the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much connected to hydrogen as it is to electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often used with the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to overcome long distances on one refueling. Purely battery-powered versions cannot offer this. Thanks to its great experience and long development, Toyota could find new markets.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, it also trusts hydrogen propulsion, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are more and more reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has been aware of so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are now "ten to sixty times less" in the forest. It is a decrease in the entire population, not in the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also dwindling.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the rainforest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become a driver of the collapse of the food chain. According to the team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
A large article about the report was published monday in the Washington Post, which headlines the new findings as hyper-alarming. "This is one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut told the paper, citing him as an independent expert.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "In our country, the decrease is also orderly," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "In our country, it just runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek, explaining why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the rainforest compared to the 70s.
Nokia is suing the Brno company over the name Lokia. People will not confuse us, moravians believe
Nokia has filed an objection to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. According to the CCV, however, product substitution is unlikely.
The Brno-based ccv software company is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the program of the Brno warehouse management company is called Lokia WMS, the daily E15 reported. Nokia has therefore filed an objection to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. The CCV considers that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program has already been used by two dozen customers, and has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a mark that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we will take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand made famous in the past by mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. The name Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one species of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies use to equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading into the field of mobile phone production. And we don't want to be compared to a brand that may be missing the train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák said in E15.
CCV applied for brand protection in August before the program was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "It applied for protection for goods and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, since the software belongs to Class 9, the related business management services in the warehouse belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software to Class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore naturally overlaps also in classes 9, 35 and 42. 'The CCV does not dispute the claim of the object as regards the conformity on those classes of products and services. Realistically, however, these are completely different brands aimed at different target groups," Ondrášek said.
A dispute over a brand can take months, according to E15, and it can complicate a company's operations.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has sermons more about theology than about politics, but then he always gets some cocoon about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services with the Hussites because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. St. Michael's on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Scouts did not go to Vienna for him, and in the morning they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing.
They took it over at the border last year as well.
The Light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the club, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing changes in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrl.
The subsequent distribution of the light on Saturday, December 18, will be taken care of by Scout couriers, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic even where the dormitories do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's similar to last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep their distance, there were as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the bethlehem light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its dissemination for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website of www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make good use of this money, but I do not understand why this money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - it produces an unnecessary product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million "xy funded/co-financed by project xy" notices in the hallways and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is a delay in development where this company is both holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Purposeful slander? Ústí Nad Labem Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city authorities attribute this to the rumors that have sprung up around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed exotic animals that he cared for. For example, it was a female rhino Zamba, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan Ňuňáka.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for a zoo with an estimated value of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the municipal Centre for Animals in Need with an estimated value of CZK 2.8 million without VAT," said Romana Macová, a city spokeswoman.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechyba (UFO) explained that the city is announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it an outrageous denigration of such a high-quality expert," she noted.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It's definitely not pleasant. Meanwhile, the zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "However, in terms of financing, the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act," explained Nikola Roštejnská, a spokeswoman for the zoo.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the Ústí cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as zoo director from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous defamation. Yesterday he did not receive phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As for the zoo contract, some veterinarians think that there is no need to worry about such self-serving accusations as in his case, but simply little awareness. For example, the Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of her yet. "It's the first time I've heard this from you. No one approached us. Such a thing, I think, will spread quickly," he added.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová posted her last photos of herself completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would judge me for taking pictures naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, you can have a solid figure even at 46. Of course, there is hard work and austerity behind it, but there is no other way."
"With Lukáš Dvořák we took about three thousand photos, chose about a hundred, and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who also came to her baptism very revealed, told Blesk.
She had an elongated jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Daily running has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so happy with the success that she kissed everyone she met at the baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavica Lucie Bílá.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads do not move me, but then I catch myself that they also influenced me - it's just so worked out that you can't always resist it.
That is one of the reasons why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to impose a total ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban the internet.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA Mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo Čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told the Czech News Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a log at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. The Albanian rescuers immediately intervened on the spot, who eliminated the fire by direct intervention and also carried out an inspection of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the mines čsa, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-South. Mining in the Lazy Mine should end this year, and other mines are also waiting for a gradual decline. The OKD mining company is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its last year's production amounted to 4.62 million tons. About 9,000 people work in the mines.
I have a feeling of this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but I will rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion that I will claim to be krytic thinking"
2. "I'm not going to believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations, and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record more than two hundred of them.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with audiences in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being created.
Four times as many Christmas films were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be many more holiday movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are mainly associated with this period, such as the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom in Christmas films didn't start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter that much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive frenzy and madness of the world we've been living in for the last couple of years," Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, but it is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will compete in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be involved in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he should have attacked for a better finish from 20th place, which he drove in qualifying.
However, Haas' Russian Nikita Mazepin will not make it to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher taking the track from the last place, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine and shows no symptoms, according to Haas.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all partie formula1.com s involved," she said.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can he.
A potential substitute would have to qualify or ride in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not struggling with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just ending season, and last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for that, too.
And everyone will be stolen that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 Spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, prohibition of activity or forfeiture of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
c) breaches by such an act an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him under the law, or
d) if such an act causes serious damage to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three years to ten years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if the act referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.
Pike in a pond, or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low state debt for his optimistic view. Or the fact that our country, according to one recent study, is twenty-fourth in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
However, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot also presented other, not so "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic is in 154th place in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may happen that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant architectural heritage as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, travel in a modern and fast way, have quality cultural stalls, live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed railway or metro to the airport for years. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally bold national library, concert hall, or national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd scramble for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism that adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more daring could be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by conservationists or other rather stubborn associations or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, Even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the excavators.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network or start building high-speed train tracks, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by a "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs of existing infrastructure are sometimes drowning in the shlendrian. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a puzzle.
Babis came into politics with a promise to "make things happen." But when it comes to making meaningful investments and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, not much has happened yet. Since 2018, an amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force, but we will have to wait for the more extensive positive impacts of, for example, easier expropriation of land. And the new building law, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, come into effect from 2021. But many people probably wouldn't bet on it.

Declaration of the End of the Right in the Chamber of Deputies or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
In the media and comments, there have recently been reports of an upcoming coalition of these parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects label themselves or what label the mainstream media parrots. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of the top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its left-wingness and thus hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in its conception, ideology and voter focus (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU has even long labeled itself as centrist - but their political compass is much further to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took everyone out of the same water clean? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, the free market and minimal state intervention in the life of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wingness? How many laws slashing people's freedoms with the salami method, raising taxes, affirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to the socialist EU, or promoting environmental and gender madness have they supported in recent years? A lot, a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.
I would not be surprised at all by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU simply belong together on the political map and, except for the Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see an obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as the "only right-wing" and by associating with these three entities, it is already openly revealing its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned those stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties label critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents in a completely identical and cheap way? Can't or just don't want to understand that there are many people who don't smell as much eurosocialism and growing unfreedom as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Are they not hiding their utter argumentative incompetence and gratuitous or blind adoration of the Eu's conditions?
It is simply possible that in the Czech Republic, politics other than centrist politics no longer has a chance of greater success. Perhaps voters really want such a connection. Perhaps they want center-left politics under the guise of "right" because they are ashamed of (or even unable to identify) their political beliefs. I don't know. But I am certainly not one of those voters.

Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Championship
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Water Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be in Spain looking for a semi-final start in the afternoon qualifying session.
From the strong representative group of kayakers failed Vavřinec Hradilek, who at the beginning of the ride received a fifty-second penalty for incorrect passage of the goal. On the other hand, Přindiš and Prskavc can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semifinals.
"I set myself the goal of going down to thirty with the first ride, which I succeeded. Not that I didn't care how I ended up, because on Sunday it starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," Said Přindiš, praising the well-being in Seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. But then in the race it was good and better today. It's beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
Sparkler was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first wickets, it didn't quite work for me. Then I drove the middle excellently, without any problems and I knew that I had the mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the erk. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is there, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that on Sunday they will go to the start at the end of the semi-final block. "I'm not an early riser, it's cold here in the morning, and when you're here for eight, it wants to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," Prindiš said. "Overall, the semi-final takes an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Prskavec agreed.
Of the three Czech singkanoists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the upper part according to my expectations, in the middle passage I felt that I was not running and I was not going according to plan, but I was able to get into the comfortable track I wanted to ride. I made two nudges and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals," Fišerová said.
A hunter was injured in a fall from a sitting position, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the top parts near the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region for cooperation. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunter in a selected locality with multiple injuries. They treated it immediately and then gently, but with difficulty transported it on a so-called Austrian trolley over impassable terrain.
"The transport along the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service and at the same time an intervening rescuer, fortunately a colleague of the hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured person was.
"We found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka application on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been there earlier and at the same time the dispatching center of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," Radan Jaškovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka application activated should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Step down, Czernin urged Schiller for words about opposition filth
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament, should use such a totalitarian expression," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the draft constitutional indictment of President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional indictment proposed by the Senate was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like how taxpayer money is being spent here, how empty straw is being beaten here. And I even dare not use harsh language, to quote one of them: It's opposition and senatorial filth," the finance minister said.
"With these terms, the Nazis used to refer to citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists to their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for a person and for an opinion," wrote TOP 09 Deputy Chairman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman with the current First Vice-Chairwoman Markéta Pekarová Adamová in the autumn.
"I quoted one of the many reports I received dozens of during the proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal denigration that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive for Thursday's meeting of the Chamber of Deputies. The fact that the term someone refers to themselves surprises me," Schillerová told ČTK.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to determine if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It is in response to an order from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoin and ether to the central bank and then have the bank pay the oil firm's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal that the central bank could count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to their 30-year low, citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions the United States has imposed on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This further deepened the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency have failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither venezuela's central bank nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It's unclear how PDVSA came up with its own Bitcoin and Ethers, or how much value it owns these currencies. The business is having trouble getting payments from customers through conventional channels because the big banks are not willing to do business with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the $700 million ($16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties could not find financial institutions to allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not be inclined to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require it to register on an exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, he wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency and pay with it to entities to which PDVSA owes. Oil firm officials believe the central bank is less exposed to any barriers that could arise when paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and Ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies due to money laundering and client information issues that are related to them and complicate compliance.
Cryptocurrencies after the 2018 debacle are making a comeback this year thanks to expectations of their greater adoption by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent in the past four days, but has made a gain of about 130 percent since the start of the year.
Tough competition for Skoda Kamiq. The Kia XCeed is betting on a wealth of equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. It leaves this item to its larger sibling, the Sportage, which is such a direct answer to cars like the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear, can remotely resemble the world of an SUV coupe, popular in this part of the market, especially among the premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed can not be ranked only alongside plastic versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so who does not want to, the Ceed in the shapes of the novelty perhaps does not even have to see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or station wagon Ceed, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect a basic atmospheric fourteen hundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged sixteen-hundredth with 150 kW, reserved for the GT version of its siblings. Don't expect a sports degree here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesels are only available in mild-hybrid versions, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps to reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon, the offer will be expanded by a plug-in hybrid, a variant that travels about six dozen kilometers just on electricity. The batteries can then be charged from a normal outlet.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much in our home," admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work in half a year.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator of his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there is another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.
If the MZ is detached from reality, it does not matter much - it will have a defective circuit flown out and replaced with a new one.
The fact is that the departure of FB from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the one under the influence is just unlucky).
I think it would clear the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of "Soviet fraternal assistance" to some of our political parties and representatives would be better clarified.
Then the people who vote for them would also have a clearer idea of whose interests they really care about.
Too bad they don't own TikTok as well.
A lot of teenagers would suddenly find out with great astonishment that even outside the sun is shining...
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against the double match penalty
Sparta football appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The Letná club announced this on its Twitter account and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeal committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now striving for the twenty-two-year-old Ghanaian striker to play in Sunday's 11th round of the first league in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a suspension from the disciplinary committee for one match for exclusion against Liberec.
The Appeal Committee did not have time to hear the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the sentence and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian stopped Tetteh for a foul on Slavist David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of a Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.

Spilková in par. In Indianapolis, he is on the verge of advancing after the first round.
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys at the LPGA Series and finished the opening day at par. With a result of 72, he is in a split 69th place, which is the expected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took a break because of fatigue and exhaustion after her previous illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European LET Series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she has not been very successful. Of the twelve tournaments, she made the cut three times, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. He is fighting to keep his card for next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by Korean Hor Mizhong. After the first round, he has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over three opponents.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! In light hair rejuvenated
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped. She changed her image until her colleagues recognized her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who had her hair interwoven with gray color, wore sedentary things and went out into society sporadically. She has always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can untie herself in terms of her image.
Fortunately, she has not succumbed to the trend of plastic surgeries and takes care of her skin using good old indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she's changed her hair color and she's completely peeked through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was dressed in a yellow jacket that made her even brighter.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks at a maximum of fifty.

On the situation in the U.S. with a leading African-American reporter.
New cases of police violence are coming to light in the United States, this time during interventions in nationwide protests.
The demonstrations that erupted after African-American George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest have opened up a debate about systemic racism, police work and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with one of the leading African-American journalists, Adam Serwer, a reporter for The Atlantic magazine.
But what would increase that funding?
The Union is pouring money into us in subsidies.
If he stops doing that, we'll stop having the money.
I really don't see how the Union's cessation of giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that's a completely different discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right lipstick shade: There's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are the cold type, if they are green, then you are among the warm types. When choosing a new red lipstick, first of all, put on the classification based on the undertone. In the next one, take into account the texture.
If you belong to women with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve colors are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such and lipsticks. You can recognize them by the fact that they tend to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.

The end of political newsagents? According to critics, the new law will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law tends to encourage ministers to absolve themselves of responsibility for the election while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in tenders for positions in state-owned companies - this is one of the goals of the Nomination Act. 119 MEPs voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation binding on the minister. In the end, it didn't work out.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination bill will play into the hands of ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind a decision of the commission and will not have a clear transparent accountability," said SPD chairman Tomio Okamura. ODS Vice-Chairman Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free, a minimum age of 25 years, and expertise should also be the main selection criterion.
The bill will still have to pass the Senate and then be signed by the president.
The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
The chairman of the police union Štěpánek has resigned, he wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. This was reported on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the trade union since 2005. He will be the union president for two more months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I handed over my written resignation to the Presidium, after which I will continue to perform my function fully for two more months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I decided as a free man who does not want to be tied to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said of the reasons for leaving.
The Independent Trade Union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts and petitions for better conditions for security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior Radek John in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed to John's departure.
From Sydney to London in four hours? Possible reality in 2030
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "When the Sabre engine is up and running, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could be traveled by a plane in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is exceeded by five times, are complicated due to engine overheating. However, Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super cold helium to prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it's a hybrid rocket and aircraft engine that's powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't evolved as much in the last 70 years, while aircraft missiles have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and you basically create a space plane."
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just have a few infusions, Joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "disease states" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president during the check-up revealed slight signs of dehydration. Its problems with low pressure were caused precisely by insufficient irrigation. "To fix the dehydration of the body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the Central Committee stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". The president mentioned that Zavoral received several hateful messages due to a health check.
According to the president, doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean as if he were not a smoker, the liver works as if I am an abstinent, the kidneys are also fine and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of the iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The question of Zeman's health became a topic especially at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances in which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president walks badly due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and has difficulty hearing. For the sake of his health, he limited smoking.
On holiday only with a credit card? NEO account offers free withdrawals from ATMs around the world!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, safety, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, do not have time to repeatedly go to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" do not want to rely on the fact that cash will be enough for them. In addition, some foreign currencies are not even available to Czech banks or exchange offices. With the NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communication and spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way not to lose your money compared to cash. When a full wallet is lost, its owner may not wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. With a quick action, they do not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages in addition to its reliable protection. For a NEO account, for example, it is an interest rate of 1.6% per annum, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros and the account maintenance is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. This often eliminates any further arrangement," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all the activities that travellers plan to undertake.
Basketball players did not reach the medal from the World U17 Championship, they finished fourth
The third World Cup of Seventeen was also won by the Americans, who beat Spain in the final narrowly 77-75 despite the 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning, but we couldn't keep it up because they beat us under the basket," regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes they took an 8-0 lead and dominated the field throughout the first quarter. At that moment, it seemed that the opponents would repay the defeat from the group stage 85:88 after overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12-2 lead.
"I'm convinced it was enough to put two or three more baskets, run away to 20 points and we wouldn't let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but in what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent catch on," coach Richard Fousek evaluated.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they did not let anything out and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were mainly held in the game by Petra Holešínská with accurate shooting from distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech shooter had a problem with fouls and was missing a large part of the third quarter on the field. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they have already maintained, even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five games were very challenging, we turned the matches in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Already against Spain it was clear that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of the physicality, we weren't consistent defensively. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we missed the rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win," Fousek added.
He believes that his wards have a promising future. "In two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European Championships of sixteen-year-olds and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with good character and it is necessary to work with it further and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach they will assign in the higher categories," Fousek added.
Mutation Omikron spreads in South Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
"We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor was there contact with anyone residing abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill on his return.
California will restrict arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced plans to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that kept the Texas abortion ban in place, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established abortion rights across the U.S. until about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was made public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge him in the usual court order.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed the maintaining of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives," Newsom continues.
He said he instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 in damages (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sell assault rifles, "ghost gun" parts or kits for making them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, would confirm.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing selected officials in the southern state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also the vaccines themselves are improved, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that.
Another fact is that in a short time a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should come on the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.
Leave the amount of curriculum.
But to rethink WHAT is being taught.
Since the time of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense and is really a waste of time.
In these matters, it would be really brutal to reduce.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And other things he will necessarily need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Don't know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have Netbox at home and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change TV and internet providers.
Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting against the law if it used the new powers to stop paying money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's €36 billion plan to draw on the EU's recovery fund to rebuild economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally withholding us from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw faces "political dictates carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
Under the bridge, someone killed a non-conflict homeless woman. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening to the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who drove along the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along Pod Krejcárkem Street could have filmed the murderer, for example, on a dash cam. Perhaps a witness could only have seen him and could describe him. In short, we welcome any testimony on this case and accept it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the Regional Police Directorate.
According to spokesman Danek, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflictual, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the crime scene. "Most often she moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags," added Daněk description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Mahulena Bočanová interrupted her annual detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided in Blesk that she had stopped drinking alcohol. "During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my old, battered fifty-year-old body a breath. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and most importantly my psyche has improved. I haven't been doing well mentally lately. I get up better, my head doesn't hurt, I have more energy, more money."
A year's abstinence was enough and the actress again found her way to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I have one drink and have fun until the morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with the Brno entrepreneur Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will newly join the series Ordinace v růžové zahrada (Surgery in the Rose Garden). "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was over-saying. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
But to know it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an avoidance, I will not even smell in any market, the event does not happen, the golden shop on the square, there may not be such a choice, but mostly they have everything I need and it has some order, so I am done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.

And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most of the anti-vaccine opponents are just a little more out of the picture than most vaccine proponents.
Rational discussion takes place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions get into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states is not solved by anyone.
Wow, so I relieved myself.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon as a child.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "catch" she just brought the spoon and laid it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few blows to the butt (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and degree) is beneficial, because the child reacts to it much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in a way whether he doesn't obey and gets it, or he gets better and the punishment won't be.
In the end, all I had to do was start listening to the warning.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, public piety on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media reported on this, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a memorial service in Paris' Invalides, where a coffin containing Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Élysée Palace announced.
Crowds have been pouring into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign a book of condolences, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a state mourning.
Meanwhile, there are other reactions from the world and France to the deaths of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe now described as "French in the true sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press reports.
The Tribal Art Museum on Paris' Quai Branly, which Chirac founded, will not collect admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
System Defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether the sacred document to which he swears and which he has been learning at school since childhood, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes they are better spared.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl commented on the question at that time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exert their power.
Covid does not choose, in the University Hospital Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder towards children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often proceeds without symptoms.
However, there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires staying in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in severe condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
"At present, a child of several months and adolescent age is lying with us," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination also alleviates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the application of the vaccine dose to children," the doctor added.
Line D will be overseen by a new underground architect, bringing experience from the London underground
The Prague Public Transport Company has chosen an architect who will oversee the appearance of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become the company, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, traveling underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Public Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to the tender, 14 other bidders participated. "Part of the selection process was a cover letter and a CV. Apparently it was decided by my previous experience in London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people," says the new metro architect. Similarly, according to her, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the City of Prague could have decided.
He does not perceive the metro only as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve. However, I will learn how this will actually take place only in the coming weeks, when the transport company will introduce me to its ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations, the aim of which is primarily to maintain the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal or whether a personality can cover it, I really don't know yet," Švarc concludes.
In the rest zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on the mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).

China builds the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is better facing the crisis
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the contagion that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters reported that there were more than three hundred children from the age of five onwards. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron circles in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of a denunciation. He described the school as a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakub Sabo, a local teacher.
The children told police that their parents or relatives had taken them to school, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north," a Sabo spokesman said of the identity of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal masqueraded as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The liberated were taken to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts are provided by banks free of charge. However, the offer should be considered because some other services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children whose basic management is usually free of charge is straightforward. Financial houses count on the fact that the forgiven fees will be returned to them one day. With a small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not mistaken," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small accounts," she says, can do almost everything that adult accounts do. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, track account movements, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach their children how to handle it and also to control their payment.
"Quite flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by looking over the Internet or thanks to information SMS. Be careful, they may not be free anymore," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options."
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any questions. In his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he glosses over in a sparkling and witty way. Although this time he was not into laughter.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly, without having to be poked around by tabloid journalists. I do not want to comment on this, it is a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would like him, of course, a successful treatment and, above all, peace! The peace he needs now," said the owner of Barrandov TV.
"I wish the media would let him go. And she waited for the news that the Master himself decides to provide to the media. I don't really like the various statements about what his old acquaintances and various celebrities think about his health. And on behalf of our media, I can say that we will only pay attention to his illness and his person if he shows interest in it. I think other media should consider a similar approach."
The couple wrapped the with tape and drowned in the river, the bag was found by the children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old that she wanted to care for. However, her partner ten years older did not like the fact that it was a, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope, greatly eliminating its vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a bag. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called out to the woman who was passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency number 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the townspeople, the police found out who was probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," a police spokeswoman said.
Expert statements from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly agonizing way as a result of suffocation, when before death the animal suffered in a matter of minutes.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The Commissioner of the Criminal Police from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both of the unpunished defendants could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková noted.
Plane crash near Žinkov in the Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were travelling on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane at half past nine in the evening asked for permission to land at the airport Chaloupky near Klatovy," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at that time it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov according to GPS coordinates.
However, it did not reach Klatovy Airport. The search for the missing aircraft, which sent a distress signal, was immediately searched for. "In addition to the police helicopter, a military helicopter was involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last reported, a helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova said.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, pieces also fell on the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and employees of the Institute for Expert Investigation of the Causes of Aviation Accidents," Korandová added.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I don't take anything, I defend myself
The traditionally high-profile battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for defending silver medallist Christian Coleman at the World Championships. The twenty-three-year-old American is the world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was jeopardized due to a case with missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without bringing charges for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense was dated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) back to April 1, 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but he did not skip the test itself until June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit the offense of three failed inspections in 12 months.
Coleman defended that he only forgot to update the data in the app about the places of residence of the athletes. "I don't take drugs, nor do I take anything legal. Many athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he said before the start of the World Cup.
The only defeat from six starts this year on the hundred was at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was only six thousandths of a second ahead of compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but he will only run two hundred at the World Cup.
On paper, the second fastest competitor with a performance of 9.86 is the twenty-two-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has only done well in American university competitions.
Defending the title will be thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb in just 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
The circle of favourites also includes South African Akani Simbine, three-time Rio Olympic medalist Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96 is 2011 World Champion Yohan Blake.
The men's hundred will begin on Friday with a preliminary round and heats. The semi-finals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 CEST.
A friend meets a friend and says, hey, don't you want an elephant?
I've got it and it's great.
The wife is glad because she grazes the grass, washes the car with her trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want for 5000, - you elephant sell.
Friend: so yeah, I'll slap myself, it's going to be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is broken, there is a giant shit everywhere, the car is dismounted, the children are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says: you're talking badly about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medical students from abroad study in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. Some of them were attempted by the Paediatric Clinic in Motol, Prague.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to get up a lot. A Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Soleimania, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon still treats small patients in private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
World affairs are dominated by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that set the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works for its integration.
It is still operating at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will succeed.

It also occurred to me, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm vocabulary.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment on 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for 'Spanish fruit and mandarin' it is no longer clear that mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further for American forces.
But again, if only I'm just a little :D
Be that as it may, it is a nonsensical demand
An earthquake of five magnitude was recorded in Tokyo.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
The horrifying footage shows the moment when a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehab experts who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent nearly two years in rehab with monkey world in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother of four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was given a twelve-week prison sentence with a suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned for life from keeping animals and has to pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause her to panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent police discovered horrific footage on a woman's phone following a raid on her apartment over drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland is heard offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine worth 1600 pounds (less than 50,000 crowns) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like, in your freshman year, do you take away the same things you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of whipping, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even scratch their heads and tell you they're totally in spades.
So what the fuck is this learning?
I'm a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people don't want to and don't need to.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly taught for the lot of people who will need that thing.
But like, the comment that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I meant absolutely seriously... ... because you just don't need to.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably due to our communist past and incitement against educated people and elites) However, the cost of having barbarians standing at our machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, for example, covid here probably never reached these proportions.
Wedding at a Glance: Kadri and Andrea's War Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to curious questions from curious fans about what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to cut off all contact and even block him on social media.
It was creaking between Kadri and Andrea from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as can be seen, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was upset in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling, and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity as his now ex-wife didn't like his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never really said these things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, it just won't give me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I am all the more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe for what.
Cao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn't think of anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In one security camera, he is captured walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cao.
The man confessed to drinking some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, while drunk he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is limited in time and effectively tied to a pandemic emergency.

More than 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
People voted for the new councils on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and in Rovné in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the councils elected here have disintegrated.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-Chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and staffing.
In Komne in the Uherské Hradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's elections, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member assembly.
The STAN list received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the assembly, with 18.52 percent of voters casting their vote.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, also got into the council for them again.
One seat in the assembly was won by the Komňané – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the List of the Municipality for the People, which was voted for by 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates of Naděje pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the 2018 regular elections, won one more seat and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has a new hope
For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always stared into space for a few minutes, immobilized and did not react to anyone. The paediatrician therefore sent him to the children's neurological clinic, where, after a series of examinations, the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, the doctors stopped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and it all started all over again.
Doctors again tried different combinations of drugs, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since Honza always stopped perceiving during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding a bike and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although sport caused him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who always had him in sight to help in case of emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists at the University Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, the local doctors decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the focus from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to have 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain that scanned its activity, then they could remove the focus. It was hell for me for several weeks. I just had to lie down and barely move, wires sticking out of my head that were connected to the computer," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the rather extensive deposit. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Compared to how normally lively and communicative he is, it was a frightening change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," the mother describes, adding: "A month and a half after the operation, he had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors, it happens. He's been seizure-free for 3 months since then."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started to cooperate with the E Society, with which he travels to schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not fully engaged in sports activities yet, he is slowly starting to return to sports. "I am learning how to do sports properly, how to breathe well, so as not to expose the body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet and which takes place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at Veselská pískovna. But next year, perhaps, yes.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing the fool to have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
Download free Metro 2033 Redux and Everything on PC, you have time until Thursday
A link to both games is on the Epic Store here. You can add games to your library directly via the web, but you'll need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play. You have until October 3rd.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original 2010 game, adding both graphical and gameplay changes from the Last Light sequel.
The story, based on the book of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky, takes place in 2033 in Russia after nuclear war. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity had to take refuge underground, in our case in the vast complexes of the Moscow metro.
"Take a post-apocalyptic world and oppressive atmosphere from an unfamiliar environment, take away the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action sequences, and tradááá: Metro 2033 is in the world," we wrote on Bonusweb in a period review.
Everything, on the other hand, is a relaxing game-non-game in a procedurally generated world that carries the message of the English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. The player can become anything from animals to trees to the planet.

A French chef sues Michelin over taking away a star. I suffer from depression, he says.
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after he won it. He intends to sue the publisher of the Red Guide to obtain the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competence of Michelin inspectors, who he said mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. He will sue the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide, Michelin, because the commissioners' conclusion was not properly substantiated. In addition, the removal of the asterisk took place without any notice. "I have been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you play with the health of the cooks?" said Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin reportedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as the chef putting cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have been working with Savoy ingredients with love," Veyrat objected to the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are fraudsters who only stir up controversy for commercial reasons." An indignant Veyrat does not understand "how could they afford to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé". "They also insulted our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.
The distinctive chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners and therefore demands the exclusion of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit indicates that he has no meaningful charge yet, and a lawyer is yet to help him formulate one. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
The man fell upside down from twelve yards.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava, who was hit by rescuers of the regional Emergency Medical Service.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two EMS crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and fell head on concrete!
In Vítkovice caught coal.
But not in the way it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to further care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, informed the spokesman of the EMS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried than about the coronavirus about inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the infection is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Řezáč.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever from a mosquito on its territory. It's related to climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito. This was reported by the DPA. Until now, all sick people have become infected with the virus when traveling or by contact with sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of infection is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a seventy-year-old man from Saxony contracted the virus. His illness was severe and he was treated for brain inflammation in a hospital in Leipzig. He's healthy now.
West Nile virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 90s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds, and also mosquitoes, which become infected with their infected blood.
The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Penova managed to beat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate at light weight, he showed great throttling against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored the victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt away with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought about by the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pene.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", nunes did not lose for seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Penova got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and knock the attack away.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier fared better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn't do very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
As a result, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock the throttling away.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a masterful triumph, putting a hard right back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he recharged him with a series of precisely aimed strokes and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she has lost.
That hip or that hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether it is a masculine, feminine or middle gender.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the genus is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declensed, they acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an uninflected form.
For example, the words "trouble" or "hip" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the first they are declensed according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the pattern "song".
For another group of nouns, there are different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: "row/line", "kohlrabi/kohlrabi" or "potato/potato" (meaning food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, such as "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally inflected, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle gender uninflected, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern "castle".
Civilization in the allotted time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "message" from one of Šimek's great short stories with Grossmann, partly set in a cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she was crying well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving in a very similar way.
They behave as if humans ruled on planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its fierce forces like a violent gust of wind a candle flame. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American natural science documentaries dealing with the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to "sneak up" and our advanced civilization will defecate from it.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes have, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen once, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano can emit it, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, into the air at least a hundred times more than has been spared at the expense of the people of Europe.
So forcibly limiting CO2 production makes no sense. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of an ice age.
Recognizing the still insufficiently researched effect of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot measure ourselves with force at the least cost!

Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There are tensions at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to march to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the ground?
Coal will give way to both gas and nuclear. Renewables won't meet the increased demand, says ExxonMobil's head of Europe
Renewable sources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be complemented by other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says this. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories in which unconsumed energy from days when there is enough sun and wind could be stored for later are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil Center in Prague, where 1200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services necessary for the company's operation.
We didn't see blue skies for three months and we were suffocating, says a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires, which Australia has been battling for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities and the inhabitants themselves coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic repercussions, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how these people are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
The victim should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But still too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Soldiers rehearse, pull down the curtains. China Prepares Celebrations at the Site of the Massacre
The army has been practicing this over recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close the curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets towards the square and warplanes circled the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud that their country would display its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other states.
Apparently, she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are approaching. But they may also be worried in hong Kong's semi-autonomous city, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against China's appointed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen put on a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of China's ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. Drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, walkie-talkies and radio wave devices are already on it, The Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social network Weibo is erasing "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said Historian Maura Cunningham, who studies China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists led by Mao Zedong won the fight against Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists, who had retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 60s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators, including students and workers, in Tiananmen Square with tanks.
Since the late 70s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have money to complete
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
This has put many people in a precarious situation.
It does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already under construction family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to unfinished and unapproved houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay mortgages and pay rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and fifty percent of them happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's difficult in that we have to comply with some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
Copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're doing well and we're going to get even better.
But real visions are missing, says the commentator of the Czech Radio Association – mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry into the new year was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO Chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman's Christmas message, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also addressed the nation.
What essential things have we learned?
The Ministry plans the meal voucher lump sum from 2021. Nothing changes tax-wise
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who do not yet receive meal vouchers, will also be able to support their meals.
According to David Rýc, Chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, however, many small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, it will not pay health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. It added that the limit for the maximum employer's contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal voucher price. The remaining part is paid by the employee, in some cases it is also paid by the employer, but without a tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal voucher for employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Like in this, my diploma seems great, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor's degree, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
State exams are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something remains in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the state exams and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got it right and I had it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we've done it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
Car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, reads the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative explanation goes on to say that for decades the medical community has ignored the facts about obesity and waged a ruthless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people that has not only affected public opinion, but has also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states right at the beginning is the fact that from knowing and knowing the facts to putting it into practice, there is often a very long and tiring journey. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew, believing that this would prevent disease. However, the British Navy withdrew from the practice due to concerns about increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then proven in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but they became mandatory only in the sixties, just as the first confirmed deaths related to asbestos date back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery — no matter how significant it was — has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obese. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as a highly personal failure of an individual who is said to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of thickness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on the diet subsequently gain more weight than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic one, where, for example, at faculties, when teaching future doctors, only 19 hours of the entire study are devoted to the issue of nutrition. Which at a time when the 60 process calories americans consume comes from ultra-processed food— that is, overly processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people typically experience shorter check-ups, doctors treat them with less empathy, and consider them more problematic patients.
But overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, Since 1980, the rate of obesity has doubled in 73 countries around the world and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
But don't overload your emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as them.
The people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe put it in such a way that he would put Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a spanner in the works for artists.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, they constantly change what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been fucking me up a lot lately, so I might have to stoop to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry have had success and can't let it happen.
In the end, I might even like to see something user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party in Donbas
The Union – yes, broken – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On the eighth of December 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Białowieża Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "The Union of the SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed in one session in the Białowieża Forest what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, put the brakes on agriculture, broke away from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender of first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of force".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident on D5: Motorway closed by truck collision
The incident was reported around 08:00 on the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through a petrol station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire brigade, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was carrying plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were shifted, which the firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 liters were pumped out by firefighters. Workers of the Environmental Department of the Beroun Town Hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the passage of the highway was carried out by a private company that also extracted contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I buy it with the idea of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism by which this meat by changing its price becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - nothing.
This about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
The Germans elected Keller to head the football association
As expected, fritz Keller, the current head of the Bundesliga Freiburg, has become the new chairman of the German Football Association. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he had no opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over an undeclared income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery in the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to restore confidence in the union and bring it out of the crisis. "It's not going to be a One Man Show, a lot of people are going to be held accountable. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After being elected head of the union, Keller left freiburg.
Děčín Zoo rejoices in a small macaque
"Our band currently has seven members. Its youngest member was born on August 17, was born to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is a male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to her body, and for a long time she did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the cub began to gradually postpone it for a short while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male," said alena Houšková, a spokeswoman for the zoo, adding that the Děčín Zoo has already successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are the so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, that is, elsewhere in the world in the wild they do not live. A typical feature is a black coat and a crest on the head, after which they have a name. Crested macaques live in rainforests, mainly at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, it feeds on plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of primeval forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. The need for protein is solved by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and young.
"Leaving aside the natural enemies that are pythons, everything else is written down by man. Locals hunt macaques as favorite prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokeswoman added.

Přerov: Driver crashed near the village of Kokory: He died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old Fabia driver failed to drive and drove off the road. The car rolled over onto the roof and he remained wedged underneath. He did not survive the injuries sustained.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle driving in the direction of Kokory drove off the road, where it overturned on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," Přerov police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the girls were handing out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like a good matrosh, full of completely useless precepts, like I should wash and not be a dick.
Too bad for paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how much of a f*ing situation they are.
She threatened me several times to hurt herself because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
For about a year it was a great relationship but then another half a year passed and she started to squint on a stick.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I told her I was breaking up and lied to her but I could talk about it next week to calm her down and not get caught up in some kind of amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Prefer to keep your distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbed by buying a cloud of tests and rushing for positives, who would not even know about this terrible disease if it were not for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator have been placed under house arrest for five days.
In the West, they have stopped the antics and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing buzzing.
I see that the good old scumbag is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises to train products and business skills quickly turned into "you may not be interested, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more on how to scare and talk a person out.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to swipe a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, you learned not to jump on every bacon right away and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
There are people successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated in the week that the army planned a final farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence against the wishes of the family, bombastic as the soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family since the beginning, the Friday date of the funeral has been agreed since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honors apply. We will only deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and will not miss all military honors, including the flight of fighter jets.
Around the last farewell to the popular general, however, there is still a tense atmosphere. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who have worked with the general in the past!
For example, the former head of military intelligence Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and "good guy".
In addition, in recent years he has regularly met him at the celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of military intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "Personally, I would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Blesk. But it can't.
"I know of other people in the organization who would like to go but are unlucky because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I don't think it's right to privatize a funeral in this way," the security expert said. Nor does the supposedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of the army's top brass play a role.
"The leadership of the army is not kept secret, and the leaders of military intelligence are not either, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media's information is true and the family has really been sidelined by the military, it is, of course, a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and their wishes," Šándor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision of Milan's Rapid with a Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
An amateur racer in the corner was supposed to enter the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently did not have a chance to prevent the collision. His wife, 47, suffered serious injuries in the accident and may suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Czechs or children are forbidden to enter. CTIA reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, misinformation of prices and non-compliance with the principles of fair selling.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to allow smaller children into the business. "When a consumer asks whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under eight years of age in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while it allowed English speakers to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit down at the table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this," a CTIA spokesman described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Since they have not yet been finalized, the spokesman of the inspection could not give more information about the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it revealed other misconduct in 64 cases. Most of these were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been imposed.
In the corporation where I work, I have not experienced many such things.
HR is at peace, managers are mindful of their management and do not stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form that it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will look at what came out and what did not) - it is more of a self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're kind of a near-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.

In four municipalities, new councils were given at the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherské Hradiště region, Lužice in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of councillors in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the councils elected here have disintegrated.
99 valid candidates ran for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men won the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 lists of candidates were registered for new municipal elections in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 3:49 a.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. Sparta awaits a hit in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. To manage the match in terms of games and results," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for club television.
In the week, the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for them. She is relieved, but the game continues to suffer.
Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, Sparta football is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, which has very good players. A difficult match awaits us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans last arrived in Štruncovy sady, in mid-May it was a clear matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a 0:4 beating, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While back then the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, now Sparta is already losing nine points after ten matches played in the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation either for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if in Pilsen it will be able to use Tetteh, who received a two-match penalty for exclusion in Pilsen, but appealed against him on Friday.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on the numerous marodka, who is the only one from the squad to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home team, who have won the last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should be missing only midfielder Čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan pupil.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be seen today and Saturday in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Václav's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the precious originals in showcases in the Chapel of Mirrors. Admission to the exhibition is free, open on both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archive looks at the written heritage from the time of the reign of Wenceslas IV from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said about the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, the work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or the breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of the Monastery of St. Peter. St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he enumerated the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the semi-figure of King Henry II of England is depicted in the introductory miniature H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Wenceslas IV Bible, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin collection of tracts by John Wycliffe from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the wenceslas IV library has been preserved on Czech territory. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king longed to build a representative library that would be equal to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library ceased to exist soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. But several codices were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition entitled What Is Hidden Under the Floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will be opened free of charge in klementinum.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a rather dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
To come to terms with how idiotically a large part of the population at all its strata is what I have a problem with until now.
I'm most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will make me finally less dependent on other people not being.
He would be stripped of his presidency and the capacity to regain it.
However, the chance that this will actually happen is very small, as others here mention.
Moreover, I am not sure that the discarding of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is such an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.

The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who renounce sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they haven't had sex in the last year than ever before.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks and video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report having not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them saying they have been sexless in the past year in 2021.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious disposition also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided by the opinion of premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
"It's true that they're a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts that trend," Stone says of the thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious affiliation.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and, most importantly, social drinking during the pandemic, are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that people without a job or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend has taken hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"It turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than is the reality. In this case, a significantly higher proportion of wrong answers were given to women and respondents without a high school diploma," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school or college students are more likely to believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), through self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from teaching at school (21 percent).
Questions about finances are consulted with parents mainly by women, while information on the Internet is more likely to be sought by men. Obtaining information about finances from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have virtually minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is crucial," Said Palendal.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Clearly, young people are on the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and their own housing.
The strategy of saving and investing in tangible fixed assets is professed by 94 percent of respondents. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The strategy of the investigation is then fully advocated by people married with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income of more than CZK 30,000 per month want to enjoy themselves.
The whole order for a COVID vaccine is about whether society should force part of the population to behave in ways that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
It's quite a difficult question, which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we do not order them to do so and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an octogenarian who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination who, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, is shouting something about bullying and the totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly inferred that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of increased ticket prices
The most expensive item is the listing fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year there were about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno for the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many tourist attractions. The Grand Prix there attracts visitors from abroad as well. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the exhibition grounds. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing listing fee for the promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money out of public budgets for other things. But to some extent, it's a political issue, not an economic one," he said.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. There is a variant of increasing the listing fee to almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in obtaining money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that the ad must be placed in places that do not occupy cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the cost will be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets," said Petr Vokřál, a Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"It was a great school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dance there. The fact that I have something Romani in me after my father completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Much fresher memories than the series The First Step has the role of the painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have been very attracted to him. "The work was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but at the same time fun. It was filmed on Národní třída, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot of filming was also done in the Southern City in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a kid who's just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he hadn't even thought about the thank-you speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To love each other and perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the Czech Lions award, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it did happen. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it didn't take long for him to lie on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop on Vančur's Stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 – but many countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American country, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully transition to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis running on electricity.
The official tourism organization says that already about 95 percent of its energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica operated on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
Afforestation density also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks, which is a lot considering the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rainforests or cloud forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and several rescue stations for sloths.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizerská fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it's not about the gentleman.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and who we probably don't see in the middle - the followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but he and a friend started talking.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group", which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on Poland's border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, artificially triggered the migrant crisis and is using people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we see a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the Chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the Lukashenko regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Vandal destroyed cemetery in Dobruška
According to a notification received by the police, the vandalism on the scattering meadow inside the Dobruška cemetery was supposed to take place on Wednesday between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.
"The material damage was estimated at CZK 60,000. Police officers ask any witnesses to the incident to share their findings in person at the office or by phone on the toll-free line 158," police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná said.
Criminologists are investigating the case as damage to someone else's property and disorderly conduct, for which there is a risk of up to three years in prison.
Drunken Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When police told her she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun crashed into the vehicle and asked for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after discovering that she had more than two per mille in her blood, they immediately revoked her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess her actions in court.
Slovaks succeed, for racist insults only pay a fine
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for the racism of fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualification match with Wales without spectators, instead the union will now only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting wards of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. Both unions closed their stadiums for one match and fined Slovakia 20,000 euros, Hungary 67,000 euros.
After the appeal, Slovaks were fined only 15,000 euros for offensive political shouts. The next match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship with Wales on October 10 in Trnava will be open to fans.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a commemorative procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of the Ayotzinapa College disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been clarified. Reportedly, the students were detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It's unclear exactly what happened next, but the investigators apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
A memorial parade took place in Mexico's capital on Thursday, with families eager to express their frustration that they were still unable to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
However, the mostly peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not shy away from destroying monuments, started fires around the city and smashed windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to apprehend it, asking the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but not one of them could be convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, and investigators allegedly tortured the suspects, APTN adds.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about dog darlings.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After F. Brabec's kitschy film Gump - the Dog That Taught People to Live, another film Here We Watch is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and the director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some well-known characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, so they start inviting dog owners, Julia's father and partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and a sense of embarrassment.
Let's sum up.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan wherever he just determines the coordinates – on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family is taken away from the hospital,  so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog could take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
However, the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a doggie competition, a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to look for "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the pension will of course get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits naked and make-up with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and chatter as a cured vegetarian, one cannot help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters' characters and point, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing clueless and the overall impression is down-to-date.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parts, they do not have much to play.
The only merit of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog buzzwords, let alone the more vernacular profanity that the characters commit.
The argument is not even the long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a bit too much erotica and a minimum of a sense of genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's how you understand the shit, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It is a job like any other, in which case a brigade for extra earnings.
Thomas Cook: The Czechs were kicked out of the hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency last week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to jan Papež, Vice-Chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three variants of possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which one it will be, but it cannot be predicted, will depend on the German owner," he told CTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the travel agency also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own pocket, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised its clients to pay the payments, according to papež, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to CTK one of the cases when the local hotel threw out all tourist offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German company and who to the Czech company. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British thomas cook group increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the contrary, the company's net profit decreased by approximately seven million to CZK 15.3 million. From previous years, however, the company remained unpaid loss of almost 103 million crowns. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is intermittent and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for israel's Water Management Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
On the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, tankers are increasing.
Water mains and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," tanker driver Imad Suleiman reported in September.
Clashes broke out in Isfahan, Iran, between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."

About 3 years ago, this happened to me too.
I the lady a little and grilled her during a conversation to find out what she wanted from me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I spent a moment with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with an exhibition
An imitation of a normalization room with a television in which footage of the brutal police intervention against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague is running. This is also in the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the curator of the exhibition, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semily on November 22, and then every day more people gradually piled up," he said. Among the most active were a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the town and the surrounding area to sign Charter 77, and the Grandfathers, who distributed the petition Several Sentences. Relatively quickly, according to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also formed. "One specific feature is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
About 50 photographs should draw visitors into the events in the city at that time, the pictures were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, filmed by František Tomíček, has also been preserved, which will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily Archive also lent a number of preserved banners of that time to the exhibition. "On them was: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very fast at that time, for example, already in December, people in an all-Semilic vote decided that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what was before such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then museum of the workers' movement," Chvátal said. One room is supposed to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household back then.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters With Us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the banner of the OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for His Community," the curator added.

If the apartment ceases to exist during the lease period, the lease will end.
If the apartment ceases to exist during the lease period in part, the tenant has the right to either a reasonable discount on the rent, or he can terminate the lease without notice.
Termination of the lease requires a written form and must reach the other party.
The notice period shall run from the first day of the calendar month following the date on which the notice has reached the other party.
In the event of termination by the landlord, he is obliged to instruct the tenant about his right to object to the termination and propose a review of the legitimacy of the termination by the court.
The landlord may terminate the lease within a three-month notice period only for the reasons specified in the provision. § 2288 of the Civil Code, he is obliged to state the reason for the dismissal in the notice.
The tenant has the right to submit an application to the court to examine whether the notice is justified within two months of the date on which he received the notice.
The landlord has the right to terminate the lease without notice in accordance with Section 2291 of the Civil Code.

a. if he has not paid the rent and the cost of services for a period of at least three months,
b. if the apartment or house damages in a serious or irreparable way,
c. if it otherwise causes serious damage or inconvenience to the landlord or persons who live in the house, or
d. if he uses the apartment unlawfully in a different way or for a different purpose than agreed.
If the landlord does not state in the notice of termination what he sees as a particularly serious breach of the tenant's obligation, or if he does not call on the tenant to remove his defective behavior within a reasonable time or to remove the unlawful state, the notice shall not be taken into account.
The tenant is obliged to hand over the apartment to the landlord on the day when the lease ends.
The apartment is handed over if the landlord receives the keys and otherwise nothing prevents him from accessing the apartment and using it.
If the tenant leaves the apartment in such a way that the lease can be considered terminated without any doubt, the apartment is deemed to have been surrendered immediately.
The tenant is obliged to hand over the apartment in the condition in which he took it over, regardless of normal wear and tear during normal use and defects that the landlord is obliged to remove.
The tenant is obliged to remove the changes in the apartment that he made with the consent of the landlord, if the parties have agreed that at the end of the lease the tenant will restore the apartment to its original state.
The tenant is obliged to remove changes in the apartment that he has made without the landlord's consent, unless the landlord informs the tenant that he does not request removal of the changes; nevertheless, the tenant cannot claim compensation, even if the changes increase the value of the apartment.
The landlord may claim compensation in the amount of the decrease in the value of the apartment, which was caused by changes made by the tenant without the landlord's consent.
Equipment and objects fixed in the walls, floor and ceiling of the apartment, which can not be removed without undue depreciation or without damaging the apartment or house, pass by fastening or insertion into the ownership of the owner of the apartment.
The tenant has the right to request that the landlord settle with him without undue delay; this does not apply to what the tenant has done without the landlord's consent.

The landlord is entitled to compensation in the amount of the agreed rent, if the tenant does not hand over the apartment to the landlord on the day of the end of the lease, until the day when the tenant actually hands over the apartment to the landlord.

If the lessee does not take over this thing without undue delay, the landlord has the right to sell the thing after prior notice to the tenant on his account in an appropriate manner after providing an additional reasonable period for takeover.
This does not apply if it is a thing that the tenant or a member of his household has clearly left.
The tenant may terminate the lease if the circumstances on which the parties apparently based the obligation under the lease agreement change to such an extent that the tenant cannot reasonably be required to continue the lease.
In the event of the death of the tenant, the contract is governed by the ust. § 2279 et seq. of the Civil Code.

Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, expecting plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
Downhill skiers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts.
While lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region set out on cross-country trails and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from the Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," jakub Hanuš, the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people went to jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare praise the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the period after covid-19.
With a few exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the Czech News Agency.
"We have only seen incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rentals and shops.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
A greater strain is expected in the period of ski courses.
David Šinták, Managing Director of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, great demand is recorded by the rental in the Novako area in Boží Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilful people who have no property go abroad.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is the election at all.
If life here is stupid, then some traditional V4 madman can also win here.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behavior and we're starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnec worked, said in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last reportedly spotted on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care group said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help her find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Mp Harriet Harman, who drew attention to Srncová's case at a press conference on Saturday, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably scared to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her native country, away from her family, and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine in this way either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he concluded that Russia wanted war.
War is hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in '38 is off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would correspond to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station.

Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Duba to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.

Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do a classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy at most pizza buns and a snack yogurt and apple.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you have to see.
Only the tip of the sapling can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from riding off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confession of Gifts about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has been living nothing more than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been dragging it together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans explaining why she has kept her love a secret from them for six months.
"I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer to her ears.
But apparently he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care at all and it jumps out of the can on them, or those whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or you insist that everyone really knows the list of your former partners in detail and is familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's žúžo, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare their new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been there for a long time as vice-president of the Football Club Juventus.
They went out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been separated on paper for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are also just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him.
The opening of pumpkin world delayed the maturation of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkův Brodsko) - A farmhouse in Nová Ves near Leština in the Havlíčkův Brod region opened the Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations composed of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins dominate the garden by massive orange pyramids. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, this year begins a week later, because the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipka family have matured longer. Even now, there are a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told CTK today.
The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has not been good for them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed, and some species did not come out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some species for connoisseurs have not been successful," Pipková said. Nevertheless, there are several types to choose from on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and chirping decorations, through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or oblong "spaghetti" to ornamental gourds of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig up plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off from the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. Pipka has been opening pumpkin world regularly since 2010, and previous editions attracted thousands of people. The decoration of pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. About other options for treating pumpkin in the kitchen, visitors themselves tell them. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, and we're inspired," Pipkova said. She noted that some housewives also pickled pumpkins like cucumbers.

Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything essential, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates usually met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found subleases together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly does not hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., this is quite a bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student, Královo pole and in that direction it is fine, besides, it is close to most but faculties (I do not know where exactly you are going).
So I have never been looking for a rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland have decided to do, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own pocket, or let them go according to the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he throws a few crowns into a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier had made such comments about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone going to have an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in a square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, it concerns five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of british Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., operating under the trade name Neckermann Cestovní kancelář, did not file an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"Ck Neckermann, however, is forced to continue to cancel the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. According to him, the 800 Neckermann clients who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their planned flight is ensured".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann," Šrámek added.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. In August this year, the travel agency entered into an agreement under which creditors were to invest £900 million in the company.
Half of the sum was to be received from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. On this basis, it was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, already on September 20, information emerged that creditors had demanded that the travel agency obtain a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal would fall. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
I would consult you directly with the person who assigned you the work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it from the eye, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and into the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would probably not recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer has simply created his own emblem that fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of an Oder Kingdom than an Odryan Empire?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.

Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our Presidency will be.
This is a much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with the English, it's quite interesting, after GB's exit from the EU.
Trump considers canceling the registration of Chinese shares in the U.S.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking Chinese firms' licenses to trade in stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the affected companies on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, dragging the entire market with them.
The share withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. He confirmed a Bloomberg report that had recently triggered a shock in financial markets. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been developed to ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the U.S. have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries is having a negative impact on the world economy and is raising fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to try to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China should resume on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not threatened, reports Kremlík. But a change of operator is at stake
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a backup plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract is finally abolished. In addition, the state is preparing other provisional solutions if the tender is not completed on time. The Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) stated this on Facebook.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year postponement. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the operation services of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," the minister said.
The state would thus look for an operator of the currently prepared toll in the tender, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor would it be a use of the old system that is now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on my previous experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the Office for the Protection of Competition is wrong and that it is objectively not possible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the time of 12 months set by it," he said.
In addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state found a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will probably not take advantage of the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. An Austrian company offered the state to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
Kremlík also reiterated that he believes there will be no need for a backup plan. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition issued a decision prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until one year after the authority's decision has become final. This is not final and can be appealed to the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for a new toll system and its operator was won by the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in a toll tender with an offer of CZK 10.75 billion for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the competition with an offer of over CZK 13 billion.
"Frightening result of the study." Islam does not belong to the West, think the vast majority of Austrians
1200 respondents were surveyed, the survey shows a considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favor of greater monitoring of the centers of Islam.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed."
For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university education or seniors over 75 years of age. Green voters, people under the age of 30 and university students, are the most welcoming.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, there are approximately 700,000 Muslims living in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim places of worship and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion here since 1912.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years now and it's totally fine.
How many times I drive from work I at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but all they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen Dada's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, so confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we were always talking, so christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm going to be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy Dáda and Lucie something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luděk Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
"Parody of justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sitting in Turkish base
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country is linked to an increased incidence of cancer among local residents.
The scientists mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan takes revenge for coup, despite international criticism
It seemed to Sik that the government, despite the study's clear conclusions, was not taking any action on the matter. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for revealing classified information.
"The study clearly showed to what extent water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies that directly relate to public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of prosecuting people sounding the alarm through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health issue," said Andrew Gardner of AI's Turkish branch.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental regulations despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions.
After the foiled 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a large-scale wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet employees. The authorities also put 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces off duty or dismissed altogether.
The opposition and human rights groups accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities defend themselves by saying that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
And are we Iceland so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few and far between, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, and smaller rainfall is recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture so far.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveller Zikmund or General Boček. Senate handed out commemorative medals
Ninety-six-year-old Boček, who was a fighter of the British Air Force during the Second World War, thanked all the winners for the medals awarded. "The Senate was one of the first to not forget and does not forget war veterans," he said. "The award I received today also goes to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
In his speech, Kubera warned against dividing society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we want it or not. After all, it is from these values that our successful present is based," Kubera said.
The awards were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, long-time rector of Tomas Bata University in Zlín Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveler and popularizer of science Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Association and vice-president of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěka. The upper house appreciated his heroism - this January he saved the lives of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter when he pulled them out of a burning car. Former chairmen of the upper chamber Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Together with Jiří Hanzelka, Sigismund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a number of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of radio free europe broadcasting, and now cooperates with public service media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and screenwriter, the musician Kocab was the head of the parliamentary commission for supervising the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was awarded in advance to astronomer and head emeritus of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs Luboš Perek in July on the occasion of his hundredth birthday. By the end of the year, the same award is to be given to the Czech native and first US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused an uproar when she visited Africa and especially the minefield. The images of him wearing a protective suit and a face shield have become iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe her last in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry has also scored when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine clearance site in Diric, Angola, and also put on a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. Surely he could not resist the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost at the age of only 13.
Harry gave a speech on the spot praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in countries where there has been war. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community to find the peace with which opportunities come," he said, also appealing for the preservation and maintenance of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mum, Princess Diana.
"The Duke is honored to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to learn about their tireless mission, and to speak out for all those she (Diana) felt most in need of being heard, even if the issue wasn't popular worldwide," Sussex Royal said in an Instagram post.
But royal fans may regret that he didn't take his wife Meghan, 38, and their son Archie, 4 months, on such a quest to remember Diana. The two have had a separate program for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.

Yeah, it will be so, I can barely keep myself in skates on the ice, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also overall hallucinations.
And whether you are a hockey team "copper Russia" or "lama China" so lose by two goals even if you do not have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what the referees do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1 motorsport, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "WE won".
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha yet
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková fell out in the 800-meter heats and the pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised her last year in London, did not pass the qualification.
The heat on Friday will be completed by hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters in her third attempt and was almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth heat in the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semifinals. It was one and a half seconds behind its maximum this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the corner, which took away my strength quite a bit. It seemed to me that I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start running again, so it was a bit uncomfortable in this one. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was glad that she had overtaken at least one opponent on the home straight. "She really wasn't doing well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for that fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyonda from Uganda in 2:00.36.
Doha is missing the best eight-hundred-year-old caster of recent years, Caster Semenya from South Africa, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but like some other runners, refuses the treatment that IAAF rules have mandated since this year.
In the 100-meter dashes, American Christian Coleman confirmed his role as the number one favorite, being the only one to get below the ten-second mark with a time of 9.98. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who at the age of 37 is trying to defend his title, also advanced to the semifinals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is number two in this year's standings with a performance of 9.86, was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 record this season.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form in the long-distance qualification, flying to a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped this far in world cup qualification in the last 20 years. Twenty-one-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with a performance of 865 cm.
Slovenians also beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the premiere title of European champions. With the support of nearly 12,000 boisterous fans in Ljubljana, they beat the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team looked much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They belonged only to the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players overcame in defense and of the players in the red-and-white jersey basically scored only the native of Cuba León.
On the other hand, both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut and the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini, were introduced in the home team. The Poles paid the price for winning all their previous matches at this Euro masterfully, while the Slovenians were gaining confidence after tough playoff battles with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenians lost 3-1 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifiers in Gdansk in August this year, but they repaid the defeat at home. But now stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana arena. Already after today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Gentle on the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not accessible to the public at other times," advises jitřenka Navrátilová, the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to CULS and watch the film Green Desert," Navratilova adds. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The slogan of this year's Night of Scientists is "gentle on the planet".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic 1967 are at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number since Oct. 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK's Health Safety Authority, said on Television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister defended that the quiz was taken "virtually", via a computer.
But it was attended in Downing Street by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, there is growing pressure to remove Johnson from the premiership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election by an overwhelming majority.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán's twelve-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can they be expected to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They are unlikely to be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, smaller or larger.
The latest one is that everyone can vote wherever they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Previously, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is a big unusual thing for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they play even harder in an effort to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of parliament and one of Fidesz's leaders, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, telling intelligence chiefs that the opposition was a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with language.

I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has her for a long time, but then she bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a child terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in convulsions and it was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they gave me a slap in the face, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, as a child I was quite fighting, now I hit at least something to discharge and as younger I slapped my parents on the hand for example (so as not to get too much over the hold), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't tell to what extent it's my explosiveness, but certainly the upbringing has a part to play in it.
I'm afraid I'll also lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just something, it's probably not possible not to spoil their children at least a little, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why op should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call pussies those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage from?

Scientists are looking for toddlers with a birth defect, called ankle valgosity, for their study
Valgozita (misalignment) of the ankles is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. As a standard, it is treated with intense exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study via the website, where the registration form and all information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is when they take the first independent steps, typically letting go of the furniture they are holding onto when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements over a period of seven months from the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants it also involves wearing the tested shoes," Gimunová points out.
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial begins with the four accused of murdering Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but it also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his links to the top slovak politicians and the judiciary.
How crucial will the process mean for Slovakia?
Sparta is really busy this year, recognizes Hradec bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will play friday against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull out," says Hradecký bek before the match of the 5th extra-league round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch its winning streak, which currently includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the most appreciated by fans, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't watch the games that were. We need to focus on the games that await us now and play in them as much, if not better," the Hradec defender points out.
Hradečci should not look at last year's balance with Sparta. In three of the four matches they lost, taking points only once after winning in Prague after overtime. In addition, Sparta's management has brought in several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we're going to talk about, this year they are really charged," admits Nedomlel before the first match at the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shichta, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinec.

Journalists are hugely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled and the company bounced it off.
There were deaths on Czech television with covid half a year ago.
Lucie Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of a seamstress and her real name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother sat. At that time, a singer was born in me," she admitted to Impuls radio.
Her father, however, was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said: 'Craft girl, craft. Walk with your feet on the ground!' He even talked me into going to the local glassworks. The glassworks doesn't work anymore, I do. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs with money," she added with a laugh.

Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Managing Railways as a Company
Heaven's election, while apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, it does not change because one of the members resigned. The makeshift lasts.
The selection process itself was a farce from the beginning, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly relaxed. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have decreased. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he defeated experienced guys from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the brightest aspect (and best hope) of the whole process. Today, the people in question know that they have only played the role of an epic backdrop in a political game.
Perhaps Heavenly will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best track boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political newsagent. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, it has to cope with competition during market liberalization and with a lack of employees in operation. Train drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves like an elephant in a porcelain factory in top management?
The second important group is creditors. We'll see how they interpret the games at the head of the tracks next spring, when the tracks defend their ratings. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. The sad thing is that someone else comes to Moody's every year to defend the rating on behalf of Czech Railways. The agency did not miss frequent changes in railway management and political influence on the company, criticizing them this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement has coined the slogan that the state must be managed like a company. For starters, it would be enough if one large state-owned company were managed as a company and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it were led by the best. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political issue. But then we can forgive ourselves for the antics of the selection process.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of repositories nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs a fundamental overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and permitting of a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their possibilities in deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is reproached by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a factual plan almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching for and selecting a site for storage, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not really have many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for a repository.
Only in some permitting procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but it is the authority or minister whose interest it is to issue the permit to decide.
Any action shall not have suspensive effect on the execution of the exploration or construction work.
The codecision of local authorities requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with havel & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following the contracts with attorney-at-law Jan Zemánek.
According to the Register of Contracts, the total amount for these works should amount to almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, Deputy Mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesman of the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local authorities vis-à-vis state authorities in search of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in a similar way as the municipalities directly affected in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to a deep geological repository.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman ( 69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the master / ruler of the given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than a standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is probably not possible to translate the boss in a one-word way, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is simply significant for the story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
And where are the viewers? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as with the pilgrimage to Doha, athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere prevailing at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of doha skyscrapers invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified its backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators is already covered with brightly colored tarpaulins, on which the flags of 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar has ventured into territory where it does not have its roots embedded despite the annual Diamond League meeting.
So let's not be surprised that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for the ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, i.e. less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling the uncovered parts of the stands at least halfway. That is why, according to the sources of the British newspaper Giuardian, they are reportedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Which Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletic Association, can also comment positively: "This is how we can inspire future generations."
Rich Qatar has won world handball and cycling championships in the past, followed by football in 2022. The financial offers of the oil superpower will always be lucrative even for wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor World Championship of Athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have been better timed by IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the whole scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start in October for athletes.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for it at least with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises ultra-modern and attractive mastery. That it's just 37 degrees? Already now the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are supposed to give TV viewers a detailed picture of what happens in athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from the Uherské Hradiště region since December 7.
Through Interpol, he is also helping the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of it.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We are sharing information on the case," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from the Uherské Hradiště region.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in posting leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a news conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it's not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the year drew to a close.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for the time being.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as Copy of receipt corrections for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
Malicious code actively scans for stored credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Formbook spyware also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but continues to be behind nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name receipt continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease and dampening of activity in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the past few months.
Today's demo of clever people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the procession along the embankment and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of estimating around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That is, there are a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I would argue that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the constant discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found common ground.
Only anti-vandals, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association have a rising popularity, it reminds me of A Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this discontent depends not only on the money inflow, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes four or more doses.
It will definitely not be a left-wing or centrist movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
An ingenious action of scientists of which humanity is rightly proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev tasked Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption movement We Continue to Change, which won the November elections, to form a new government.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties advocating the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
Of the "secretly" captured footage, it is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, information about the children's hospital worker is also being called by her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance bears no resemblance to her behavior and we're starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnec worked, said in Saturday's video.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work on Sunday, November 28, around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last reportedly spotted on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the health care group said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help her find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also a regional pirate councillor) was reported by an anonymous person that his paintings violated copyright.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of the Little Mole in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the RMD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole was still there.
Eventually, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RMD began to "intensively deal with the situation".
Microplastics have reached human intestines, a study has confirmed for the first time
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwabl has published a study that demonstrates for the first time the presence of microplastics in human stool. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia , tiny plastic particles between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in samples of all the people studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packaged in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example, for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive tract of a person has therefore only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness suspect that this is not a good thing. However, humanity still does not know how bad this is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind and has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no other solution than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years humanity will consume a fifth more of them than today. The current pace is an impressive one million bottles bought per minute. Every year, about eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already adopted restrictions and other measures, kenya for example - under the threat of draconian penalties - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering minor bans (well-known straws), and the same direction is being headed by the Domestic Ministry of the Environment. Critics, however, argue that such measures, while nice, are totally inadequate.
