Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
Exactly in the middle of the match with Vegas, he alternated and from this time on the ice rinks of the NHL has not yet presented himself.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver-based fullback announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning us time, he was called from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of his shots.
The Plzeň hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his senior year, he had hip problems and in the shortened pandemic year, he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Francik" caught 36 games, his success rate of interventions is at number 92.3 %.
Charles puts on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate as this year's Christmas card chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which his wife Camille at the races helps to put on a veil.
On its website, this was reported by the British news station BBC.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and the foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a T-shirt with a collar.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, it is not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, for a photo intended as a Christmas card, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the races at Ascot.
Charles, who has a top hat on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil in color matched with a bright dress.
Slavia by efotbal.cz she promised Berber a million for the title, the hard man denied it.
Prague-criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former deputy chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman berbr was supposed to have promised Slavia Prague one million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
It was reported by the server efotbal.cz with the fact that he got to a part of the police files.
Jaroslav tvrdík, chairman of the board of directors of the vršovický club, said that the red and whites had not committed any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia mainly figures its former sports director Jan nezamar, who last summer in the Championship club finished.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red-whites was in frequent contact with both berb and the former sports director of the then second-league Vysehrad Roman rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The criminalists allegedly worked with information that Slavia berbrov promised a financial reward for this when she received the title.
2019 team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors slavie Tvrdik.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, did not seek to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard, " Tvrdík said for the news list.
Among other things, Nejmar indiscriminately insults some former players of dark-skinned Slavia and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
In mid-October last year, the case of alleged match-fixing through referees was sparked by a police crackdown on several places, including the FAČR Prague headquarters.
The highest ranking in the affair is berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPS are LARPing the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen have to take out of the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars-Toyotas hi-lux-are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles-at a decent level, in addition, they have already managed to get rid of the Praga v3s even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport-too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones-few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
Air defense: medium-cold war, obsolete; short-range-good, modern, relatively good number.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Gemini with Will Smith did not thunder criticism
The dystopian science fiction spectacle Gemini (Gemini man) boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith confronts his younger version in the film. But, according to critics, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas 10. October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute leader in his field. It kills efficiently and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang his career on the nail. This, of course, does not like his employers, who will send another killer to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more precisely, his younger clone created from DNA. Can one determined man win a fight against himself? This time, literally.
A certain guarantee of quality was to be three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. Although this is his first science fiction, he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and dragon or the Western Ride with the devil. Six screenwriters worked on the script at once. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful game of Thrones. According to early reviews, even this was not enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to make it stand out," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents that participated in it. A weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of filmmakers," summed up Stephen Dalton of the Hollywood Reporter magazine.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly unified action movie," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge does not hide his disappointment.
"A confused product that came up with a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp of IndieWire summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care about one man being a doppelganger of another when neither man behaves like a human being," wrote Nicholas Barber of the web site The Wrap.
I have a story.
I got a chase right outside of town.
Nutria were coming out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I just sat down and the guy didn't seem to notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course the fox came in a minute.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, he was waving his headboard all over the place, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got out of my seat, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive stuff in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.

Homeland got respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The irozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for a respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices moved so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more expensive?

An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in the feature documentary film by Olga Spátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga špátová will have its premiere in Czech cinemas in the spring of next year.
"In the middle of September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked if I would make a documentary about his life with Karl again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! It was and is a great honour for me to film with a man who has stood in the limelight of Czech culture for more than half a century thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence. I accepted the invitation to make a full-length documentary about Karl Gott, who brings joy to three generations of listeners with his art, as a commitment to this legendary singer, " director Olga špátová describes her feelings.
The first day of shooting, thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, was already 22. October last year, and the last shots with Karl Gott were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear-to capture authentically Karl Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for 60 years has been giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed throughout the world. A man who has inscribed himself in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being them.
The film is not meant to be a parade of the undisputed fame of Karl Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott phenomenon with this current one. Everyone is different. At least by the fact that we filmed them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed us all in what kind of legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time that is truly indescribable," adds Olga špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karl Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team in such a way that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about topics quite confidential. She and her husband, cameraman Jan malíř, have become part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's Jubilee. But because I had a lovely summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it be released to cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession, " says Karel Gott himself.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the numbers that the older generations have suffered), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that could be seized by trained people, we do not actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where who can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is going to lead mass guerrilla and it is also a pronounced need to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will be conducted only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
Xxx Lutz can buy competitor Kika, authorized authority. But there's a catch.
"The office for the protection of competition has authorised the merger of competitors - xlcee-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and lambda properties Czechia, on the other hand, subject to compliance with the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition," said Martin švanda, a spokesman for ÚOHS.
In addition to the XXX Lutz chain, xlcee-Holding owns Möbelix stores. If the Kika chain were swallowed up, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, he has to divest part of the company being bought.
Xlcee-holding also buys Kika's branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Even there, the transaction must be authorized by the antimonopoly authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa Holding was announced by XXX lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is the second after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it had been owned since 2013 by the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings. The latter faced problems when it discovered irregularities in its accounts. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
Xxx Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, JYSK, Asko-nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest sellers of furniture on the domestic market. The same owner has the brand möbelix. After taking over Kika's foreign offices, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
Only children. Reproduction is not certain, but we do not have to scare
Some words have sinister connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. These include the word only child. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know that, only child," they say, without further ado. It is interesting that the" only child " bears this trait from a long time ago, even from the times when terms such as the demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today attains this value. At most, it is close to France or Sweden, but the European countries do not have a simple rate of population reproduction. (Within the west, only Israel stands out with an aggregate fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising when the minister of labour and social affairs maláčová is also failing him: "there are almost as many only children as families with two children," she said in an interview for LN. But she left out the devil in the detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing it. For example, in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "so did Hitler"). It's good to be reminded that many couples are directly planning their only child. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let's note one thing.
When Minister maláčová says that" there are almost so many only children", there is a touch of demagoguery. That statement should have been made 20 years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last provided simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it dropped to an ominous 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is necessary. Only with this alarmism can they ease up a little.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. From a private company will buy 6000 apartments
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing units sold by the city 15 years ago for 920 million euros ($23.8 billion) from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA. It responds to public pressure to rebel against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin lompscher for the party of the left (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants certainty," Berlin mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue the construction of new apartments and legally treat the freezing of leases," he added. The municipal company gewobag will take over the thousands of apartments located in the districts of Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas rothäusler, the city bought too expensive. Bloomberg rothäusler said that, according to his estimate, housing units overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation through their actions. The FDP said this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money".
Already in mid-July, gewobag acquired back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel reminded on its website. The price was not published at the time by the prosecutor's office. The dispute over apartments on the former exhibition Avenue from the Times of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. He became a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, wrote the newspaper.
At the same time, the German metropolis used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. According to AFP, rental prices have doubled in the past ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
especially we do not have individual skill.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then there are such situations that you watch a dude who missed an empty gate two minutes ago, go on the attack alone among 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they'll take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill" get a defender " is so terrible that I found myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one player of the opponent.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly mistreated! He ended up in the Institute
It was about nerves. Allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel for punishment, " Lucie described in the exchange. Dad Lukas made little Ondra kneel in the corner for hours! Off camera, he must have suffered like this on a wooden foot massage mat! "Ondřej came to me after the shooting and said to me-auntie, I'm making these troubles and remarks just to not be here, because I want to go to the institute," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the door of the studio apartment. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken from his family after the shooting and placed for a month in the center of educational care in české Budějovice. He briefly returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then wandered to the diagnostic Institute for problem children. "When I arrived home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I barely reacted to that at all. But then she texted me that the kid was institutionalized, then they gave him back, now he's in the ICU. They are both out of work, " says mum Lucie from Pilsen.
Of course, the Lightning also reached the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta excuses herself and hangs up the phone.

The Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, Czech banks, O2 and Avast did well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 and technology company Avast pulled him up. On the contrary, the Austrian titles and the media company CME did not fare well. It follows from the results of trading on the site of the exchange.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague stock exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually closed with a small profit. "However, during the whole week, the PX index lost slightly over one percent," said Josef Dudek from fio Banka.
Domestic banks partially corrected the declines of recent days. Komerční Banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to CZK 113 and operator O2 added 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola securities rose the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Less than a percent was acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
Securities of the energy company CEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
Losses were three titles-Erste Bank wrote off 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance company Vig 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. On the euro lost four pennies to 25,85 CZK / EUR, on the dollar three pennies to 23,62 CZK / USD. This follows from the data on the Patria online server.
The first swallows
The covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, however, experts do not expect any major reversal for the coming weeks.
The onslaught in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As it was said, the first to get to the domestic patients is Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
What is often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, eastern Europeans, and especially Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak has grown".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the west, they tell you how they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
They're afraid to cancel culture, to say this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20%, according to the survey.
French Oscar nominee Les Miserables launches Be2Can show
Golden Bear and both winners of the acting prizes from this year's Berlinale, the directing prize and the jury prize from Cannes and much more will present 6. festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. Also this year, be2can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and stimulating presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Miserables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly took the jury prize at this year's Cannes festival. The picture is a French nominee for the Oscar. The premiere of the film in Prague will be presented personally by the representatives of the two main roles of the police of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril zonga. Alexis Manenti is also a co-author of the script of the film.
Be2can will take place this year in the Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas in Prague, as well as in Brno (Kino art), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple cinema) from 2. 8. October.
The directorial feature debut of Director Ladj Ly was shown and awarded at a number of other world festivals after the success in Cannes. Durban won the best film award and the best screenplay award at the IFF, it was also shown at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be shown in San Sebastian.
During the festival, however, the audience can also look forward to the films synonymy, young Ahmed, system violator, goodbye, my son, sorry, we missed you, the anthology Ghost Town and the picture at the golden glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to the Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, na český Triumf Nabarvedené ptáče.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of units, so that soldiers do not have to re-learn where what is, so all objects are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of brdy, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of deployment of warheads due to the westernmost position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only warheads were kept, not whole missiles as they say.
If there was a need to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Apart from the museum's maple, the rest are in a state of disrepair.
Babiš called for security cooperation at the memorial to the victims of terror
Prime minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited 27. September 2019 in New York the memorial of the terrorist attacks of 11. September 2001 ground zero.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all states of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of the 11th and 12th centuries. September 2001 declared the Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš. On this occasion, the prime minister paid tribute to the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It is a very touching place," said the prime minister, as he, accompanied by his wife Monika, placed a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak emigrant Alena sešínová. Both were among the more than 2,750 dead claimed by the hijacked aircraft attack on the former World Trade Center (WTC) skyscraper pair. The towers of the World Trade Center collapsed after the impact, in their place is now a memorial with the names of the victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. Attack on the United States of 11. September 2001 was cited by the prime minister as the reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. The terrorists then, in addition to destroying the skyscrapers of the World Trade Center, crashed a hijacked plane into the building of the Ministry of defense in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, presumably the White House or Congress. But this plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all the states of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," the Czech prime minister added.
In the second grade of primary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was absent a little, he went regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He went to school in the countryside, did various monkey business, but he was fine, hopefully never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, another class.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police were often there, they threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something on the ad (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I sold often to gypsies, they always had money, they did not try any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later and said he had already overwritten it..
I myself say that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as he behaves the way he belongs in a decent society (works, works, does not beat women, just normal behavior).
But as soon as someone comes, he reaches out, eviscerates apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, makes trouble.. well, I don't care what color it is, but I don't mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash on Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana fajtlová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemia ambulance service, told pravu.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of bavorov and, for reasons not yet established, he turned into the opposite direction.
Štěpánka schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident after the collision with the ŠKODA Octavia.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute prehospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in české Budějovice, said paramedic fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Lukáš neuheisl also orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector says.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and send the post office data for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officers expect the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader already at the time of sale, it will be charged by the customs office from the total amount for the shipment and for transportation.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the remuneration of the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of incoming shipments from abroad at the international post office in Prague decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
In addition, according to the Czech post, the problem is that people do not respond to requests to supply the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about half here, says Matyáš vitik, a spokesman for the Czech post.

Dealing with inflation
See headline, How would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get maybe added (who is the employee)?
They added 2% gross to me this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run when I work.
Which cities disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian parliament confirmed a well-known rumor for several days: Canada is withdrawing the honorary citizenship of the former legend of the struggle for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her part in the genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to take away Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the world," Independent Senator Ratna Omidvar commented on the decision of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that accomplices of genocide are not welcome here in Canada - much less as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of a long-time human rights campaigner on the atrocities that the army of majority Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months against the Rohingya Muslim minority is intolerable.
The fact that officially organised genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has completely failed in her duty to protect her citizens has recently been brought to light in a UN report. In particular, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that-as the report says - "shock both with the horror of their actions and with the enormous scale". According to the United Nations, Suu Kyi and her administration have been complicit mainly by covering up the soldiers ' actions and spreading a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation."
After the removal of Suu Kyi, five figures remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin gjamccho, 14. Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49. imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousufzai.
The Canadian Museum of human rights also reflected developments surrounding the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy, where Suu Kyi's profile included information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take away her honorary citizen title. "We have also dimmed the illumination of her photo on a plaque depicting a timeline of the struggle for human rights, and we are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Canadian media quoted museum spokesman Rory McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain so in the current turmoil of Suu Kyi-at least for now-is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Vaclav Havel in 1991 for her enormous contribution to the struggle for democracy. "Although the current actions of Ms. Suu Kyi are regrettable, her award will not be canceled," Lars Heikensten, the head of the Nobel Foundation, told Canada's CBS.

The prosecutor general resumed the prosecution of a mother who manipulated her daughter against her father
The Supreme prosecutor Pavel Zeman does not agree with the acquittal of the mother, who for a long time manipulated her daughter and violated her relationship with her father. She was facing charges of abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman does not agree with this. In a similar act, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a crime can be seen.
The decision of the Supreme Court could have a wider impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary also from the point of view of directing further application practice," says Zeman's appeal.
The district court in svitavy first found the woman guilty last year of mistreatment of the entrusted person and endangering the upbringing of the child. With her daughter, she formed a strong, even symbiotic bond, even in a situation where she should have been entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a sharply negative attitude towards the father. The situation marked the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm in the event of handing over to the custody of the father.
Svitavsky court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. But the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appeal proceedings, it is not said to be a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to decide again.
The regional court found that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are by no means exceptional. They are dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection bodies. Only rarely is the solution criminal law.
However, according to the chief prosecutor, the woman committed both cruelty and threats to education. "The accused acted purposefully in arousing in her daughter negative feelings towards her father, and purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. In doing so, she not only pursued an illegal intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with a minor, but she had to be aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case once again to the regional court. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.

Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven rapists are sent to prison for only six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months only to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his / her victim will have a trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim may never recover from it either.
Doesn't this discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
The first miss Christ finally went into herself: she lost a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern miss of 1989 Ivana christová (49) had long years of problems with excess weight, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she took the reproaches to heart and with extra pounds went into battle. Even if it's a long run.
She used to be a world-class beauty who conquered Paris. But since then, thirty years have passed, and Ivana christova can only remember the beauty contest. Not just because of the fame, but because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as slim as possible and often did not eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she just has an appetite for.
But from hunger strikes she switched to overeating, which immediately took its toll on her figure. The extra kilos she tried to disguise with various loose clothes, which added to the size of the plump shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana's really into herself. Visibly losing weight, she began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised all those present at the baptism of the book Miloš Zapletal (75), that she had once again seen through and already has the features of a charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but also the very first one that the audience at the Palace of culture and sport in Ostrava whistled like senseless when she put on her crown.
Repair of the Krkonoše museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše national park administration (krnap) has postponed the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original date for opening envelopes was 20. September, said national park spokesman Radek drahny. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for the submission of tenders is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"At the moment we are working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, then the work will begin as soon as possible, " said Dear.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. Krnap wanted to have a selected supplier of construction parts by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not threatened.
Krnap administration is unable to choose a construction company for the repair of the museum. The second tender was launched this summer, because in the previous tender all offers of companies significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. The bids exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the krnap administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected firm should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of a new exposition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The krnap visitor center should be built in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exposition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exposition stone and life, should serve as a representative entrance gate of the giant mountains for visitors. The visitor center should provide the most understandable form of information about the past and present of the giant mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also assume the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities to organize concerts, festivals, theatrical performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the establishment of a study or cafe.
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationwide wanted girlfriend from kostomlat, on which an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to her.
He took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
The officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency number and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made up everything so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Czech police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the PCR.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally am of the opinion that the Slavs have long been ethnically and culturally we are not, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course I agree with the meme, it's a pity that Churchill did not manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in Příbram: the culprit will not be punished
Unexplained cases are called "memorials"in forensic slang. But even these are investigated if new information comes to light after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, the criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí Valley, 12 years old at the time. "The 1955 case? It will be hard, very hard. It would take a start to find the file, it may no longer exist, to talk to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really hard, " says Markovic.
Under the previous regime, violent crimes were not widely reported to the public, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminalist thinks. The problem may be that materials from 50. flight 20. they can be destroyed, although unsolved cases should not be shredded.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history is kind of baked in. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book the end of history and the last man: "what we may be witnessing... it is the final point of the ideological development of mankind and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government."
Twenty-six years later, we are seeing rather illiberal models triumph from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism flourish. Fukuyama's current ninth book, identity: the demand for Dignity and the politics of Resentment, attempts to balance these forces. As his interview with George Eaton for the New Statesman shows, he reconsiders many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be returned to the public space, and Marx was right in many respects. At the same time, he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics have not understood the end of history and the last man correctly.
"What I said back then was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that... Liberal democracies do not even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, do not see the point, and therefore group themselves into groups according to identity that give them a sense of belonging."
In its time, the book the end of history and the last man was written as a strong argument against the Marxists, who perceived communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked how he now sees the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "it all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then, in my opinion, this will not work, except when clear public services are in demand. But if you mean redistributive programs that are trying to solve the huge imbalance in income and wealth that we are already seeing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long period that President Reagan and prime minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the fore, has had a disastrous effect in many ways."
In the end, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation, warning all liberals that even the advent of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which God or gods should man choose?
I would say that it is quite probable that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one God who will severely punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it is said that there is no god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed would send me to hell or some similar place for it?
Uncombed wants $ 45 million from the state.
The Ministry of justice, according to the spokesman of the office of Vladimir řepka, has received six applications in this regard so far and is now analyzing them. The young man was imprisoned for two years for assaulting a woman, but the justice finally exonerated him.
Both the chief prosecutor Pavel Zeman and the minister of justice Marie benešová did not appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec state prosecutor's office indicted the then 20-year-old student of the grammar school Nečesaný. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by the doctors of the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent, and I swear to it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the injured, but I am not the perpetrator, " the young man said earlier in court, who did not deny that the fateful day was in the hairdresser. He said he wanted a haircut. But he left after his wife told him he was closing. He turned himself in to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later she called him the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Králové regional court successively handed down five judgments in the case. At first, he was found guilty twice and sentenced to 16 years in prison, the Supreme Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed gradually headed for prison twice, but each time after the intervention of the Supreme Court was released. After the ordered replacement of the judicial chamber, repeated acquittals finally fell, the last of which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in March this year.
At the same time, Jiří lněnička, chairman of the board of Appeal, stated in the grounds of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but, given the procedural situation, he did not have a better option. He said that he had dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her objections were justified.
"The problem of this case is not that there was a lack of evidence, but their evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was collected in the pre-trial proceedings, which would have been sufficient for the admission of guilt in another criminal case, " said lněnička.
But hradecký, as well as the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not change if the acquittal was overturned.
Other: voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
I think the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, x months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
All branches of the ACR could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of defense.
We can say this: cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of blending taking place, with the workforce migrating from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar blending should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that there will never again be a Russian, a German or, for example, a Mongolian Raider.
​I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a mess.
Well, bless you.
Just one U.S. election that screws up their budget, and NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the poles have already shown once that they just need to show their back and take what they want.
The only thing that functions as a guarantor of independence for a long time is a heavily armed army and a population that can control the military equipment of its time.

Kovosvit sells an office building and other halls. Expecting worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Among the main problems of last year, the chef ranks the lack of staff and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is related to the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which are either not used, or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where from five floors it uses two, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down kovosvit, to streamline its activities.

How not to drown in a boxed tsunami
You unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is swamped with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can, by Agreement, bring to the involved store (project map KAMsNIM.cz there are almost 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid cluttered blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, since packaging cardboard has risen in price by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One of such stores is also Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of eco drugstore and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to us by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular deliveries of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
Application www.KAMsNIM.cz however, it shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
Thus, all garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
"Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, swaps and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukličme česko association.
Managers of state-owned companies are to undergo a new selection procedure. The law will be possible to circumvent, says the opposition
"This is a typical bill that is useless," said ZBYNĚK Stanjura, chairman of the ODS group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the chamber of Deputies approved changes designed to prevent the opaque distribution of functions - critics speak of newsagents - in state-owned companies in the future. New candidates should go through a selection procedure in the respective ministry and will be considered by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution, which, for example, the ODS does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that the selection committees are to blame for the possible poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee for the minister will not be binding. The novelty has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Milos Zeman.
Rather, it seems wrong to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throws everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.

Let's rewrite history, really
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend-it starts in January-and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency's logo, called for the protection of Europeans-at work, on the streets-and mentioned so many events that they could not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it that way, and so do the voters.
Macron's supporters, split between the right and the left, agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe", and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators were quick to criticise Macron for being pro-European and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and not look at what is happening in France.
Wouldn't she be needed?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened Cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?

The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna duričič.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the first rungs of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu / being stung" for a few days I had diarrhea and didn't really feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.

Kristýna Plíšková did not reach the final, her second title is still missing
In 2016 she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit and this year she performed very masterfully.
After wins with Paolini, kawaová and Kužmová, she fought her way to the top four.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Kristyna. The Belgian held her serve and broke Plíšková's serve twice in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck soon took a 3-0 lead and Kristyna failed to turn it around, even though she managed to turn one break point. At the last, she turned away one sword, but at the second, the end came.
Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times no
Undated photo shows Adolf Hitler visiting Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the allies became involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and then faced a German attack, what would have put the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly, it would not be either of these weapons, although in them the Germans had an overwhelming superiority over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses-because of blisters.
Zeman monument keeper-man suspending the Constitution calls for law enforcement
Who moves in a camp-divided society and does not want to go completely crazy, he will welcome a situation when he does not have to root only for his own. When he can admit pluses even to the one whom he otherwise criticizes. Already so that he does not feel that he is oriented only according to the pre-assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of badly damaged monuments, which President Zeman swears by during his favorite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what's going on. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of these devastated monuments - from the Centers of historical cities to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or estates - with their own eyes. Everyone knows that even here he can come to the word demagogy. That if we reproach the town hall does not care about monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it can be the work of former administrations. Or an object privatized, the owner of which is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls: "the paragraph of the monument law allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not take care of their property."But even if the owner is unattainable, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause like squatters, which he himself does not recognize. Two years ago we wrote: "Despite all the epithets, squatters draw attention to a problem beyond the current interest. To the fact that this or that building is in disrepair."And let's admit that the president does de facto the same.
If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. By the time Jachymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and Tolar mining (for Americans dollars). Why? I heard it was for a quick-sell home in the ' 90s. years, officials say. But how is it that seven kilometers away the island, the seat of the šliks who minted the jáchymov tolars, has the historical core nicely repaired? It is good that the president brings these things to his attention.

The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem-mělník-Nymburk-Kolín.
The carrier will replace české dráhy after success in the competition of the Ministry of transport.
RegioJet will run a total of 16 routes daily, eight in each direction.

LEO Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil sedlařík, despite the planned lockout works, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar running times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva Trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in, for example, Českolipsko, where on the line from Mladá Boleslav through česká lípa to rumburk, Trilex trains of the German company die länderbahn will run instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform rail fare for the second year.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.

I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, die.
I've never heard a lesson from the perspective of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in the schools that black people were often sold into slavery by black people themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans slaughtered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, right in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern one.
I have not met with the fact that someone deliberately concealed the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and in my opinion it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in one's feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaveholders are quite popular there, but on the other hand, they had some of their good successes, and I found it absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people nowadays idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the south was a slave owner, and a lot of things went against them, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our point of view does not exist with them (there was also a video from the TV on YT, where they turned off someone who started talking about our Legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny in U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was terrible at some universities, the students were radicalized enough, and the schools encouraged them to do so many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I'm a little sick of the idea that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
At the moment, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also did not encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole useless from the point of view of any personal identity.
If anything connects me with people, it's interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
Police have charged Czech Tourism Manager Aleš Pangrác over advertising contracts
Police have charged the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism Aleš pangrác over contracts for promotion. Pangrac server listmessages confirmed that the charges took over this week. Czech television (CT) reported last year that police officers in the case are reviewing contracts worth CZK 38 million. Part of the money, according to the police, went back to Pangrác, writes the server. In the case, the criminalists were also interested in the minister of regional development Klára dostálová (for yes), to whose department CzechTourism belongs. The investigation in the case, according to the server, continues.
Detectives from the National Center against organized crime were gathering evidence in this case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry of regional development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodrome in most, or at the Sport invest agency. The office computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court search warrant for Dostálová, which had already been cited by the Czech news agency, stated that in 2016, when she was deputy minister, the minister decided on expenses of CzechTourism for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostalova said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, she did not doubt, she could document everything and fully cooperate with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's fault. The media has previously reported that this is the former director of the Department of regional partnership in CzechTourism Aleš pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This resulted in the conclusion of 48 problematic contracts by CzechTourism.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment further, " Pangrác told the north list news.
Toyota hydrogen still confident, preparing the second generation of the Mirai car
The Toyota Mirai was never supposed to be just a concept. Toyota took it so seriously that even if there was practically no hydrogen refueling infrastructure in the world, it nevertheless put it on the menu. So not quite standard, the customer had to really purposefully go after this car, but no one else then offered such a variant.
Toyota chief Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at the international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and within ten years they will be on a par with hybrids. Of course, this is due to the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much about hydrogen as it is about electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often associated with the need for environmentally friendly operation not of passenger cars, but, on the contrary, of large tractors, ships, trains, etc., simply those means of transport that need to overcome long distances for one refueling. This purely battery versions can not offer. Toyota could thus, thanks to great experience and long development, find new outlets.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, they believe in hydrogen propulsion, and Hyundai, which now also offers a hydrogen crossover Nexo.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on earth. But reports are mounting that the insect kingdom is drastically shrinking. Another scientific study on this topic came out just this week, and the situation, according to her, is even more serious than humanity has realized so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write right at the beginning of the report, insects are now in the forest "ten to sixty times less". This is a decline in the entire population, not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that are dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinning.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. Thus, according to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
The report was published on Monday in a large article in the Washington Post, which makes the new findings immediately in the headline as hyper-alarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, whom the paper cites as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also concerns Europe. "In our country, the decline is also an order of magnitude," says Lukáš čížek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. However, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the landscape changes that play an essential role in Europe. "In our country only runs significantly longer than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to explain why in the rainforest compared to 70. years ago, scientists could measure such a rapid decline.
Nokia sues the Brno company because of the name Lokia. People will not mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia filed objections to the application of the Lokia brand to the office of industrial property. However, according to ccv, product substitution is unlikely.
The Brno company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish manufacturer of telecommunications equipment Nokia. Finns do not like that the program of the Brno company for warehouse management is called Lokia WMS, wrote the daily E15. Therefore, Nokia filed objections to the application of the Lokia brand to the industrial property office. The CCV considers that substitution is unlikely.
Marketing director Petr ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers, it has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone attempts to register a trademark that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand famous in the past by mobile phones when creating a warehouse program. The designation Lokia according to ccv is based on the Latin name for one species of Dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be an analogue of the movement of storekeepers around the warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of substitution is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software with which companies equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading into the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be running out of steam in its field, " CCV manager Tomáš kormaňák responded in E15.
Ccv applied for trademark protection in August before the launch of the programme at the industrial property office. "Protection was sought for products and services in classes 9, 35 and 42, since software belongs to class 9, related warehouse business management services belong to class 35 and computer software development to class 42 according to the international classification," said ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia trade mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore, of course, overlaps also in classes 9, 35 and 42. 'The CCV does not dispute the claim of the objector as regards the conformity of those classes of products and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups, " said ondrášek.
The dispute over the brand can take months, according to E15, and this can complicate the company's activities.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is such a nice guy, he preaches more theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some coronavirus shit that makes everyone feel ashamed.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite church.
Officially Moderna are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to church services with the Hussites, because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on botanická street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they celebrate Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Plamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took him from Austria
Breclav-the flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the reintal – Breclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we take part in every year with the section, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me that I was chosen, Scout amálie budíková told the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the reintal – Breclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually scouts go by train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes about the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch cikrle.
About the subsequent delivery of light on Saturday 18. December will be taken care of by Scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, of course, to wear veils, try to observe the spacing, there were as few as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way as to be as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem light event, Zuzana hrbková.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem, which wanders through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its distribution for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the basics of economics that say subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will properly use this money, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned-a useless product is produced and it breaks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million “XY funded/co-funded by project XY” signs in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not a promotion of a company that gives work to x people, this is a hindrance to development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Purposeful slander? Ustka zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to rumors that arose around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav poživil, that he purposefully killed exotic animals that he cared for. For example, it was a female rhinoceros zambu, an elephant Kalu or an orangutan nuñaka.
Therefore, the city council announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the city centre for animals in need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," approached the city spokeswoman Romana macová.
Deputy mayor Věra nechybová (UFO) explained that this is the third time the city has announced a competition for veterinary services. "Dr. poživil had to explain these unfounded suspicions. I consider this an outrageous dehonestation of such a quality specialist," she noted.
Specialists specializing in exotic animals, according to her, are very few. "It's definitely not pleasant. The zoo, meanwhile, provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contract cost the same money. "The garden has to comply with the law on public procurement in terms of financing," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola roštejnská.
Václav poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation in which the USTA cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. Anonymous slander on his person did not comment. Yesterday he did not answer phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As for the contract for the zoo, some veterinarians believe that in the zero interest in it there is not necessarily concern about similar purposeful allegations, as in his case, but simply little information. For example, the veterinarian of Ústí nad Labem, Jiří král, has not heard of her yet. "This is the first time I've heard this from you. No one called us. Such a thing, I think, will spread quickly, " he added.
Simona krainová: fuck the age! Then she kissed Lucia white!
The day before the baptism of the calendar Fuck the age (translated by M*dat age) Simona krainova published her last photos, on which she is completely naked! "I was a little afraid of people judging me for taking naked photos at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that when you want to, you can have a solid figure at 46. Of course, there is toil and renunciation behind it, but there is no other way."
"With Lukáš Dvořák we took about three thousand photos, chose about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked, " the model, who also came to her christening very exposed, told The Flash.
She had an elongated jacket by Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. Daily jogging has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so pleased with the success that she kissed at the baptism of everyone she met. Husband, friends, even The Nightingale Lucia the White.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap-especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads do not move with me, but then I find that they also influenced me - it's just so sophisticated that one can not always avoid it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who now want a total ban on programme-driven (= targeted) advertising...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics-I would have banned the internet.
In the underground mine Čsa in Karviná burned, no one was injured
There was a fire in the čsa underground mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured, Ivo čelechovský, a spokesman for the mining company, told čtk.
The fire broke out at 04: 25 in poruba at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. Banská Bystrica rescuers immediately intervened on the spot, who destroyed the fire by direct intervention and also carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible, " the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be determined by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná area, coal is already mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the mines čsa, lazy, Darkov, čsm-sever and čsm-jih. In the Lazy mine, mining should end this year, a gradual decline is also waiting for other mines. OKD mining company is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year amounted to 4.62 million tons. 9,000 people work in the mines.
I have a feeling that this virus is rooted in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original point of view, which I'm going to say is critical thinking"
2. "I'm not gonna believe everything the media says."
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV fell in the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of them this year have two hundred
Los Angeles-movie theaters, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have bucked the trend of Christmas movies and will premiere a record-breaking two hundred this year.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDB.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years is scoring among the audience and significantly increasing the ratings, therefore these pictures are being created more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its total only those pictures that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will be a lot more holiday films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, there are mainly fairy tales associated with this period, there are also popular pictures at home alone, love in heaven or the classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures started only in 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable television station Hallmark, recalled the BBC server.
Her adventure project called Countdown to Christmas (countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its viewers for Christmas already 22. October and will present a total of 42 Christmas images.
The rival station lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
"In this magical season, the story doesn't matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll be home for Christmas movies, described the genre with exaggeration.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark television uses the same formula for its films, which, although uniform, is successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, is successfully resolved and the two kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not enter the final race of F1.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Thus, the Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season he had to attack the better position out of 20. the rung you ran in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable, however, will not interfere in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi in the end.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher, Max Verstappen of the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title, will go to the track from the last rung.
Mazepin, according to the statements of the Haas stable, is quite well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine, because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the final priority for all parties involved, " said her representatives for formula1.com.
Haas won't send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
A possible substitute would have to pass a qualification or drive in another part of the weekend.
With covid-19 does not meet the first racer.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the season, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could go to jail for that, too.
And nobody cares what the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.

(4) the offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
Pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low national debt. Or the fact that our country, according to one recent study, is 24th in quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.
However, the developer Dušan kunovský and the architect Josef pleskot, in a television interview on the occasion of the summit of architecture and development, presented other, not so "rosy" data. For example, that the Czech Republic is at 154. place in the world in the speed of construction management. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant building heritage, as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also a slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies, in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. Moderna: it is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, but people with an improving standard of living will also want to have somewhere to live, to travel modern and fast, to have good-quality cultural stalls, to live without the unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or build an expressway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall, or National Gallery. The reason for this is not only absurd scramble for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something more daring could succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by the monuments men or other rather well-intentioned associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding Jan Kaplický's" blob " proposed for the new building of the National Library, president Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the dredgers.
However, the list does not end with a threshold. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building high-speed trains, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, in šlendrián, repairs to existing infrastructure are often carried out. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a done deal.
Babiš came into politics promising to "get things done". But not much has happened yet when it comes to meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Since 2018, an amendment to the law on speeding up the construction of transport infrastructure is in force, but we will have to wait for more extensive beneficial effects, such as easier land expropriation. And the new building code, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. I don't think a lot of people would bet on that.

Declaration of the end of the right in the house or what "right" coalition ODS, TOP 09, Stan and KDU?
In the media and comments recently there are reports about the upcoming coalition of the parties mentioned. Many are applauding that the 'right' is finally coming together, but I am more interested in why these parties still identify themselves as right-wing.
Apart from the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it does not matter how the subjects themselves refer to themselves or what label the mainstream media parrot. The ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, the top 09 is clearly the party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism and thus hypocritically refers to itself as conservative or even right-wing). Stan is a party that, by its concept, ideology and voter targeting, basically merges with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU has even long labeled itself as a center-left party-but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took them all out of the water? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal state interference in the life of individuals and the economy. How do they fulfil this general assumption of right-handedness? How many laws cutting people's freedoms with a sausage sizzle, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and increasing surveillance, increasing ties to a socialist EU, or promoting environmental and gender madness in recent years? Very, very much. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with being right-wing.
Coalition cooperation TOP 09, Stan and KDU I would not be surprised at all, on the political map they simply belong to each other and, except for Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I do not see any obvious difference for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. However, the ODS has long portrayed itself as "the only right-wing party", and by associating with these three entities, it no longer reveals its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties consistently and cheaply refer to critics of dirigism and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Are they unable or unwilling to understand that there are many people to whom eurosocialism and growing inequality do not smell as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not by any chance hide their utter inability to argue and their groundless or blind adoration of the euro-union situation?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, politics other than the center no longer has a chance of greater success. Maybe that's what the voters really want. Perhaps they want left-wing politics under the cloak of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they cannot even identify them). I don't know. I'm certainly not one of those voters.

Prindiš, sparkler and Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the world championship
Kayakers Vít prindiš and Jiří prskavec and canoeist Tereza fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Cup in water slalom in Seu d'urgell. Prindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, sparkler fifth and fišerová eighth. The next three Czech players will be in Spain for the semi-final start in the afternoon qualifying session.
Vavřinec hradilek did not succeed from the strong representative group of kayakers, who immediately at the beginning of the ride received a 50-second penalty for an incorrect passage of the goal. Prindiš and sparkler, on the other hand, can already relax and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I set myself the goal to go down the first ride to 30, which I managed. Not that I didn't care how I ended up, because Sunday starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position," said prindiš, praising the well-being in seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then during the race it was good and today it was better. All the time it's beautiful, nice races, the audience came, so fine, " he smiled.
Even sparkler was happy. "In qualifying, one does not particularly want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first goals I was not very good. Then I drove the center perfectly, no problems and I knew that I had mileage, so came the second mistake, when I wanted to go down straight and I turned the Erka. Overall, I can not be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes from there, " said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised that on Sunday they will go to the start only at the end of the semifinal block. "I'm not a morning person, it's cold in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you want a jacket and a sweatshirt," said prindiš. "Overall, it takes the semifinal an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," sparkler agreed.
Of the trio of Czech singkanoists, only fišerová succeeded, Eva říhová finished two places behind the top 20, Kateřina havlíčková was 35th. "I rode the upper part according to my ideas, in the middle passage it seemed to me that I was not in time and not going according to the plan, but I was able to get to the comfortable track that I wanted to go. I made two putts, and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals, " praised fišerová.
The Hunter was injured in a fall from a sitting position, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the top parts of the devil's mill.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers to the injured man with proper equipment. At the same time, we asked the medical rescue service of the Moravian-Silesian region for cooperation. Medics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident, " Libor Kluz, the dispatcher of the Beskydy mountain service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found a huntsman in a designated area with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him, and then gently, but with difficulty transported on the so-called Austrian trolley through the impassable terrain.
"Transport along the route of about one and a half kilometers was slow and difficult. The injured Nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after about three hours, " Libor Kluz added.
Fortunately, according to Radan jaškovský, responsible chief of the Beskydy mountain service and an intervening paramedic, a colleague of the Hunter was able to describe in detail where the injured person is.
"We therefore found it relatively quickly. However, if he had an ambulance app on his phone, our rescuers would surely have been there sooner and at the same time the dispatch office of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," Radan jaškovský noted.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the ambulance app activated should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Step back, urged Schiller for words about opposition filth Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government should use such a totalitarian expression anywhere, much less in parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir when discussing a draft constitutional lawsuit against President Milos Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the draft constitutional lawsuit, which came up with the Senate, was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single voice in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president, and messages like, "how taxpayers' money is being spent here, how empty straw is being threshed here." And I even allow myself, I do not use harsh expressions, to quote one of them: it is opposition and senatorial filth," said the finance minister.
"These expressions were often used by the Nazis by citizens of Jewish origin, and by the communists by their political opponents. This is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for people and opinion," TOP 09 deputy chairman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairman in the autumn with the current first deputy chairman, Markéta pekarová adamová, wrote to the minister.
"I quoted one of the many reports that I received dozens of during the proceedings of the house. Their common denominator was the disgust at the constant personal dehonestations that we witness daily in domestic politics, and which was also the main motive for Thursday's session of the house. The fact that someone applies the term to themselves surprises me, " Schillerová responded for čtk.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden Bitcoins and does not know what to do with them
The central bank of Venezuela conducts internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to an instruction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and then the bank pays the suppliers of this oil company with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying the proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the minimum in 30 years. Citing information from four sources, this was reported by Bloomberg.
The sanctions imposed by the United States against the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This further exacerbated the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in global comparison, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro's effort to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency has failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways around the restrictions.
Neither the central bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It is not clear how PDVSA came to own bitcoins and ethers, nor how much value these currencies possess. The enterprise has problems obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels, since large banks are not willing to do business with entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of 700 million dollars (16.6 billion rubles) in Chinese yuan, because the parties could not find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.
PDVSA may not have the appetite to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the exchange and undergo an in-depth review, the so-called due diligence. Instead, it wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency and pay with it the entities to which PDVSA owes. Representatives of the oil company believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise when making payments with crypto-currencies.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized internet ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of the money laundering and client information problems associated with them, complicating compliance.
Cryptocurrencies, after the debacle of 2018, are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to the expectation of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen almost 20 percent over the past four days, however, since the beginning of the year it has a gain of about 130 percent.
Heavy competition for Kamiq damage. Kia Xceed is betting on a rich equipment, at what price?
Kia Xceed is a relatively difficult to classify model. It falls clearly among compact SUVs, but does not offer all-wheel drive.this item leaves the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct answer to cars like Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, the Xceed also bets on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely remind the world of the SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the Xceed can not be classified only alongside the brushed versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to it, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so who does not want to see the Ceed in the shapes of the novelty may not even see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed station wagon, the Xceed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect a basic atmospheric fourteen. The Xceed starts with a turbocharged liter and also offers a turbocharged 16-piston with 150 kW, reserved for the sibling version of the GT. Don't expect a sports degree here. Turbodiesely 1.6 CRDi is offered only in mild-hybrid design, that is, the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps to reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible in addition to the manual to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.
Soon the offer will be expanded by a plug-in hybrid, that is, a variant that will travel about six tens of kilometers only on electricity. The battery can then be charged from a normal socket.
Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price tag of the most expensive sweater amazes!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home they never wore sweaters very much," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work in six months.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
Silver stars then adorned with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but Silk will give the sweater softness," the creator praises his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
To date, the most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720 000 crowns.
If the MZ is disconnected from reality, it does not even bother much-it will let the faulty circuit fly out and replace it with a new one.
The fact is that the departure of FB from Europe would greatly help its non-Russian part (the latter under the influence of Holt is unlucky).
I think it would clean up the social climate quite a bit.
Alternatively, the channels of "Soviet fraternal aid" to some of our political parties and representatives would be better clarified.
Then the people who elect them would also have a clearer idea of whose interests they really care about.
Too bad he doesn't own TikTok.
A lot of teenagers would suddenly find out with great amazement that the sun is shining even outside...
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against the two-match penalty
Football Sparta appealed against the two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary commission for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0:3).
The flight club announced this on its Twitter and is now waiting for the verdict of the appeal commission.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's domestic cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now aiming for the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker to feature in Sunday's 11th-round clash. first league round in Pilsen.
The situation of last October could be repeated. At the time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary commission for his expulsion against Liberec.
The appeals board did not have time to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the punishment was postponed and Falta could start on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week, and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian stopped Tetteh's activity for a foul on Slavist David Hovorka, for which he received in 82. a minute from the referee Miroslav Zelinka straight red card.
The alleged spit of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomas Souček has not been proven.

Spilková steamed. In Indianapolis after the first round is on the threshold of the procedure
After the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis, golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds.on Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys and finished the opening day with a par. With the result 72 is on the divided 69. place, which is the projected cut.
24-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month medical break and did not pass in Portland until the second half of the tournament. She rested because of tiredness and exhaustion after her illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European summer series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she is not doing too well. Of the twelve tournaments she passed the cut three times, the best was 32. Hawaii. So he fights to keep the card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played by the best Korean hor Mi-jung. After the first round, he has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over three opponents.
Petra chernocká changed the image and did well! In light hair rejuvenated
Film saxana Petra černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life's jubilee in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she's helped make it happen. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra chernocká never looked like a typical grandmother, who would have her hair streaked with gray, wear sedate things and go out sporadically into society. She has always taken care of herself, and the older she is, the more she is able to indulge in looking at her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of the skin with the help of good old-fashioned indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she's changed her hair color and completely seen through.
When she came to a social event where celebrities said goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was also dressed in a yellow coat, which made her even more radiant.
Ladies should learn from saxana how not to underestimate themselves, that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks like she's 50 at the most.

About the situation in the US with a leading African-American reporter.
In the United States, new cases of police violence are coming to light, this time during the crackdown on nationwide protests.
The demonstrations, which broke out after African-American George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest, opened a debate about systematic racism, the work of the police and cases of brutality against American minorities.
Lenka kabrhelová talks with one of the leading African-American journalists, Adam Serwer, a reporter for the Atlantic magazine.
But what would increase that funding?
The union is pouring money into us in subsidies.
If he stops doing that, we'll stop having that money.
I really don't see how the fact that the union stops giving us money will cause us to use that money for something else...
You could argue that the money from the subsidies could be used better, but that's a whole other discussion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: there is not only one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test-examine the veins on your wrist. If they're blue, you're the cold type, if they're green, then you're the warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, put in the first place precisely on the parting on the basis of the podton. In the next one, look at the texture.
If you belong to women with a cold podton, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve colors are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin podton, choose such and lipstick. You can tell them by the way they gravitate toward orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green, and others-blue. In this case, congratulate yourself-you do not need to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.

The end of political news? The new law, according to critics, will not help anyway!
However, according to some opposition members, the law is more likely to absolve ministers of responsibility for elections while continuing to select their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies-this is one of the goals of the nomination law. 119 members voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of yes, the CPSU, Social Democrats and even pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection procedure before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will record ministers. "The minister will now be able to hide behind some commission decision and will therefore not have a clear, transparent responsibility," says SPD president Tomio Okamura. ODS vice-president Martin Kupka speaks in a similar way.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free status, a minimum age of 25 years, and the main criterion for selection should also be expertise.
The bill will still have to pass the Senate, and then the president will receive it for signature.
The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Sappers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
The head of police unions Stepanek resigned, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the independent trade union of police Milan Stepanek decided to leave his post. This was stated on Friday by the Czech Radio-Radio Journal. Štěpánek led the trade unions since 2005. He'll be union president for two more months. In the police even after leaving the head of the union will remain.
"I can confirm that I submitted my written resignation to the bureau this week, after which I will continue to perform my duties to the full for two months," štěpánek told radiožurnál. "I decided as a free man who does not want to be forever chained to the trade union. And who wants to live a quieter life, " he stated the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the interior. Among other things, the Union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then minister of the interior, Radek John, in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed on John's departure.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, a possible reality
Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket one. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed at which the Concorde flew. "Once the Sabre engine is operational, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And, for example, the distance between London and New York, the plane could manage to travel in one hour.
The server independent notes that the so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is exceeded five times, are complicated due to overheating of the engine. But Sabre (Synergetic air Breathing rocket engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super-cold helium, which should prevent the rise in temperatures.
"The most important thing about sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases created from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Missiles over the past 70 years have not undergone such a great development, while aircraft ones do. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and essentially create a space plane, " he added.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
My heart is like a bell and my lungs are like a non-smoker's. Just have a couple of infusions, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (CNS) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital Miroslav Zavoral, doctors did not find any "disease states"in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday. birthday.
Doctors at the president at inspection revealed slight signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused precisely by insufficient irrigation. "To fix the dehydration of the body, I will take several infusions that will get minerals into my body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, according to him, the director of ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral received several hate messages because of the medical examination.
According to the president, doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on the body. "So, a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if it were not a smoker, the liver works as if I was a teetotaler, the kidneys are also fine, and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
Editorial staff iDNES.cz she turned to the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about her health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially at the time of last year's presidential election or during some public appearances, during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to the Prague Castle, the president does not walk well due to diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and worse hearing. For the sake of his health, he limited smoking.
On vacation with only a credit card? Neo account offers ATM withdrawals worldwide for free!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include comfort, security, but also the possibility to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a credit card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, do not have time to go repeatedly to exchange offices to exchange cash. And even "vacationers" do not want to rely on the fact that cash is enough for them. Moreover, Czech banks or exchange offices do not even have some foreign currencies. For neo account, we have solved it so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are, " says Kateřina Petko, director of marketing and communications and press officer of Expobank cz.
In addition, a credit card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. With the loss of a full wallet, its owner can no longer wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he only loses his payment card, he can easily immediately block it over the phone or through internet banking. Thus, when acting quickly, he does not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has, in addition to their reliable protection, other advantages. For example, the neo account has an interest rate of 1.6% per annum, which is among the highest among current and savings accounts. Its creation and management takes place completely online without the need to visit the branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100 thousand euros, and the account management is completely free, " adds Kateřina Petko.
For everyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere possession of a credit card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with embossed Mastercard Gold and Mastercard business cards, travel insurance is an integral part when traveling abroad to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. They often do not have any additional equipment, " adds Kateřina Petko from expobank cz. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance in question, that is, whether it covers all the activities that travelers plan to take.
Basketball players on the Medal of the World Championship Under 17 years did not reach, finished fourth
Even the third world championship of seventeen was won by the Americans, who in the final defeated Spain just 77:75 despite 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't keep it because they rolled us under the basket, " regretted captain Karolína malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes they took the lead 8: 0 and dominated the entire first quarter on the court. At that moment, it seemed that the opponents would pay off the defeat from the base group 85: 88 after overtime. However, the referee whistled 15 fouls during the half and with questionable decisions helped Hungary to return to the game with a 12:2 lead.
"I am convinced that it was enough to put two more three baskets, run away to 20 points and we would not let it go. But instead came our mistakes. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch, " evaluated coach Richard Fousek.
"It was not the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they did not let anything out and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good, " he added.
The Czechs kept in the game especially Petra holešínská accurate shooting from a distance and pivotka Tereza šípová. However, the Czech top scorer had a problem with fouls and missed much of the third quarter on the court. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they already kept, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five matches were very difficult, we rotated the matches in a narrow rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Already against Spain, you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of the physicality, we weren't consistent defensively. We didn't play a quick counterattack, we missed a rebound. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't put everything together, it's hard to win, " added Fousek.
He believes that a promising future awaits his ward. "In two years, the girls were able to win the Youth Olympics, to be second at the European Championship of sixteen-year-olds, and now they are fourth in the world. It is a quality team with a good character and we need to continue to work with it and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories, " added Fousek.
The Omikron mutation is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Health and Human Services is looking into another case of a child from Adam's.
"Currently, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from adamovo, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov elementary school is not proven,“ said ciupek.
There were six cases in the county in a week.
"We are still waiting for official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the national reference laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the state Institute of health in Prague," said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from the same department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and adamovo.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who was abroad.
The association with the championship in water polo is not in any of the Listed, said ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, was being checked.
There were also players from South Africa, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California will restrict gun sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous US state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of the heartbeat of an embryo.
People would then be entitled to damages in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement came in response to a ruling Friday by the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld Texas ' ban on abortion, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that set the right to abortion across the U.S. at roughly 24. months of pregnancy.
However, the court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban in this case was transferred to the public, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual judicial channels.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which allowed the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported the maneuver of Texas to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand damages of at least $ 10,000 (over $ 220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, components for "Ghost weapons" or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of Supreme Court liberal Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant full immunity from judicial review to the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like, and also there is an improvement in the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already rolling in large numbers.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it's too early for that yet.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine should come on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater efficiency.
The amount of the curriculum calmly leave.
But reassess what they're learning.
Since the days of Maria Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a little bit, and learning phone books and copying textbooks into notebooks no longer makes much sense, and it's a real waste of time.
There's a real brutal way to go about these things.
On the other hand, how many people leave elementary school with some basic financial literacy?
And the other things he's gonna need to live?
How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home we have netbox and I pay for a telly sports package for the Spanish and English football league.
However, the latter does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I do not want to change the TV and internet provider.
Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against the law if it used its new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw € 36 billion from the EU fund to rebuild the economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would have lost a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified in view of the fact that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobro's tenure jeopardize its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is building"impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw is facing "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under Democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
"We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony," he said.
Someone killed a non-combatant homeless woman under the bridge. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening until the night of Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony refers.
"Some of the drivers, who drove along the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or along the street under krejcárkem, could have filmed the murderer, for example, on the dashboard camera. Some witness might just have seen him and described him. In short, we welcome any testimony on this case and will receive it on line 158, " said Jan daněk, spokesman for the regional police directorate.
According to a spokesman for the tax office, the murdered homeless woman was non-combative, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. At the scene of the crime, a woman lived. "Most often she moved around krejcárk, palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags," daněk added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.

Mahulena bočanova interrupted the annual detox and again sins!
More than a year ago, Mahulena bočanová confided in the flash that she was quitting alcohol. "Over the holidays, I thought I'd give my tired old 50-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. I haven't been in a good place mentally lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year of abstinence, they say, was enough, and the actress again found her way to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or good wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun until the morning. I've got a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time, " boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with the Brno entrepreneur Peter.
After the holidays, bočanová returned to the theatre season and will take part in the series "ordinace v růžové záhrada". "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was swearing. But it's getting better, " smiles the actress critically.
But to understand it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I also met one yogurt more than once, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an eviction, I will not even smell in any market, no action, golden shop on the square, maybe they do not have such a choice, but usually they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.

And I don't care anymore.
For two years I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more out of touch than most vaccine supporters.
Although rational discussion is taking place at the expert level, only extreme opinions are being brought into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Color cakes instead of robust analyzes.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states no one solves.
Ugh, I'm so relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a good day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never because of grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to bed, fought with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "catch" the stove only brought and put so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to obey, I received a couple of blows to the ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and measure) is beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in his own way whether to disobey and get it or get better and there will be no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, public pieta will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French president Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This is reported by the French media with reference to Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a piety in the Paris Invalides, where the coffin with Chirac's remains will be exhibited, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been streaming into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign a condolence book, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, then President Emmanuel Macron declared state mourning.
Meanwhile, other reactions are coming from the world and from France to the deaths of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "a Frenchman in the truest sense of the word".
Chirac was remembered, for example, by the Japanese, as the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, the French press notes.
The Museum of tribal art on the Quai Branly Avenue in Paris, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
System defense
In 1999, when Vojtěch CEPL, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, was answering a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him – whether it was a sacred document to which he swears and which he has been learning since childhood in school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save them with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch CEPL voted the question.
Recently, however, among lawyers, the opinion that the constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is increasingly emerging.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch CEPL belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But CEPL was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution, among other things, is a kind of order of government, consisting of individual rules that set out the politicians of the game.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fighting for the life of a multi-month baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the clinic of pediatric anesthesiology and resuscitation at the faculty hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told the newspaper.
The course is much simpler, easier, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period, " Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
The latter takes place in the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were on the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid-19 pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay on the resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease strikes next to adults both adolescents and several-month-old babies.
In hospitals, even children in severe condition due to coronavirus are found.
"At the moment we have a child of several months and adolescent age," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that the children's hospital FN Brno has not yet recorded any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, there were 6. December to the death of six children aged 0 to 14 years.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not only in the coronavirus department-he is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, so in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"Therefore, the application of the vaccine dose is recommended even in children," the doctor added.
The D line will be overseen by a new metro architect, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague transport company has chosen an architect to oversee the design of the Metropolitan metro. From October, Anna švarc will take over, her primary task will be the design of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro can not be viewed only as a transport structure, traveling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
A Czech architect who participated in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, for example, won a tender put out by the Prague transport company (DPP).
The tender was attended by 14 other bidders. "The selection procedure included a motivation letter and a CV. Apparently decided my previous practice from London, where in a team of three people I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the metro there," says the new metro architect. Similarly, according to her, her practice from the Institute of planning and development of the city of Prague could also decide.
The metro is not perceived only as a transport construction. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve. However, I will find out how it will really work in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas, " says švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed primarily at maintaining the context of all stations in the event that they are reconstructed," the design manual approximates.
Whether a similar tool is also a way to improve public space in the Prague Metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal, or whether it can be covered by a personality, I really do not know yet," concludes švarc.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They are visible on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing / biking in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much outside the national parks).

China gives the impression that the disease has been contained and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist jirouš: China gives the impression of having managed the disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was facing criticism for failing to stop an outbreak that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero infections.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are often helping in the fight against coronavirus, for example, even in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Hundreds of enslaved children freed from religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were almost five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were over three hundred children from five years above. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of denunciations. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were arrested during the raid, according to police spokesman jakubu Sabo, they were local teachers.
The children told the police that they were taken to the school by their parents or relatives, saying that it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the North," said spokesman Sabo to the identity of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal pretended to be a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The liberated were taken to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met with relatives.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Children's accounts banks provide for free. But it is necessary to consider the offer, because some additional services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses count on the fact that the forgiven fees will return to them one day. With a small migration of Czechs between banks, they are probably not mistaken, " says Kristýna kuncová from dtest.
"Small accounts", according to her, can do almost everything that accounts for adults. The child gets his own payment card, he can enter payments, track the movements on the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks may set up an account, but it is up to parents to teach children how to use them and also to control their payment.
"Quite flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, and so on. But above all, it can monitor what is happening on the account, either by browsing through the internet or through informational SMS. Attention, these may no longer be free, "adds Kuncová, adding:" if a parent is considering an account for his child, he should consider his capabilities and possibilities."
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: he wishes him peace
Presenter and businessman Jaromir Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any questions. In his program call and write to the boss, he publicly expresses himself on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he gleefully and wittily glosses. Although he wasn't laughing this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. The singer himself promised one very thoughtful thing.
"You know, Charles got sick, and he said it fairly, without having to poke around somewhere tabloid journalists. I do not want to comment on this, it is a serious illness, we all have great respect for Karl Gott. And I would like to wish him, of course, successful treatment and, most importantly, peace! The peace he needs now, " said the owner of the TV Barrandov.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And she waited for the news that the master himself decides to give to the media. I don't even like the various statements that his old friends and various celebrities make about his health. And for our media, I can say that we will address his illness and his person only if he shows interest in it himself. In my opinion, other media outlets should consider a similar approach."
The couple wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around valašské klobouk. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. However, her 10-year-old partner did not like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope, greatly eliminating its vocal speech. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a sack. At the moment when the dog was thrown into the water, the dog was clearly alive, " said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika kozumplíková.
The next day, the children, who were playing by the river, found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they found the body of a dead dog inside. So they called a woman who was passing by, and they ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency line 158.
"The police, thanks to the knowledge of the townspeople, found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. A man and a woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place, " added the police spokeswoman.
Expert statements from the field of Veterinary Medicine confirmed that the dog died clearly in a harrowing way as a result of suffocation, when before death the animal suffered in the order of several minutes.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this despicable way, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The commissioner of the criminal police from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both previously unpunished charges could, if convicted, spend up to three years behind bars, " kozumplíková noted.
Plane crash near Zhinkovo in Pilsen: two people did not survive the accident
The plane was carrying two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane requested permission to land at Chaloupky u klatov airport at 9: 30 p.m.," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladman. This was also the last record, at that time, according to GPS coordinates, it should be located near Vojovice near žinkov.
Klatovy airport has not flown. After the lost aircraft, which sent a distress signal, immediately began to search. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter was involved," said police spokeswoman Martina korandová. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last checked in, a helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," confirmed korandova.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, pieces fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will determine the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for the professional investigation of the causes of air accidents," added korandová.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything.
The traditionally high-profile fight for the fastest man on the planet will be on the world championships in a hurry to the silver defender Christian Coleman. The 23-year-old American is the leader of the world charts with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the top of the season was jeopardized due to a case with missed doping tests.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without filing charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) dated back to 1. April 2018, that is, to the beginning of the second quarter, however, the test itself missed up to 6. June. And because the third omission occurred on the 29th. on April 20, 2019, Coleman did not commit a misdemeanor in the form of three failed inspections within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he only forgot to update the data in the application about the whereabouts of athletes. "I don't do drugs, I don't do anything legal. A lot of athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about, " he said before the start of the World Cup.
The only defeat from six starts this year on the hundred was suffered right at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was only six thousandths of a second ahead of compatriot Noah Lyles. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run a double hundred at the World Cup.
On paper, the second fastest competitor with a performance of 9.86 is 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has so far succeeded only in American university competitions.
Defending the title will be the thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who in June at Stanford flashed with a time of 9.87. He ran the last 100 in Zagreb but only in 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
The favorites also include South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre De Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican is the 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96.
The men's 100 starts on Friday with the preliminaries and heats. Semi-finals and finals are on the agenda on Saturday. The medals will be competed at 21: 15 CEST.
A friend meets a friend and says to him: Hey, do not you want an elephant?
I got him, and he's great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, the car washes the trunk, the children play with it.
Oh, just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
All right, high-five, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is broken, there's giant shit everywhere, the car is broken, the kids are fighting, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says, " you talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."..
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The head of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of doctors from abroad study in the Czech Republic, who could stay and work here. The pediatric clinic in Prague Motol tried to get some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to get up a lot. The short-haired Kurdish woman flew to the Czech Republic from sulejmania, a city in the north-east of Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and still treats small patients in private practice in the afternoon. In addition, he teaches at the university.
World affairs are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works towards its integration.
The latter works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different, and it will be successful.

I thought of that, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I'm just starting from the fact that an ellipse usually involves 2 different units on the same level.
To borrow an example from another comment, 'Spanish oranges and tangerines', where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for 'Spanish fruit and tangerines' it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to specify it further for US forces.
But again, I'm just saying: D
Be that as it may, This is a senseless request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey Kosman Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutritional needs.
The magistrate's court in Gwent has now banned her from breeding animals for Life, reported The Sun newspaper.
Monkey rehabilitation specialists who care for Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the staff of Monkey World in Dorset and now she is again happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent magistrates ' court, she was given a 12-week suspended sentence of one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The head of the small monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further.“
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
Milly's abuse came to light after Gwent Police discovered horrifying footage on the woman's phone following a raid at her flat over drug charges.
In the footage, Milly can be heard swearing profanely.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, " Do you want cocaine?“
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the calculation of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months, and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts you learn from that prehistory three times in a row, when you bravely skip the whole 20. century?
Like you're going to carry the same things in freshman year as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of cramming, where no one, honor to the exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
Just write a 1 test and then nobody cares.
Go out on the street and ask random people if they can figure out the roots of quadratic equations and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the vast majority won't even take a bite and tell you they don't give a shit.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the fact is that people do not want and do not need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's kind of a learning curve for a lot of people who are going to need this thing.
But, like, the comment that you don't really need all this to stand at the machine, I meant it... ...because you just don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
However, the price of barbarians standing in front of these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, covid here probably never reached this size.

Which is the main reason why she can not leave Switzerland right away, " Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the nosy questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Things between Kadri and Andrea have been rocky since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she flatly refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he was upset with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's now ex-wife did not like even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally comment on things like that, and even in my family, we never really said those things to each other.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
It makes me all the more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to the words of Andrea.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what for.
Cao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
After that, he did not think of anything better than to climb to 5. floor and open the window to climb into the apartment.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently detained cchaa.
The man confessed that on the incriminated day he drank some alcohol.
And since he needed money, in his drunkenness he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to 5. the floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and is tied in effect to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

Isn't that enough of a reason?
The right to assemble shall be limited, but not abolished.

Epilepsy complicated his love of sports, thanks to the operation he has a new hope
For the first time, the parents of Honzik noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always looked into space for a few minutes, became immobile and did not react to anyone. Therefore, the pediatrician sent him to the children's neurological clinic, where doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for the doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped him from taking medication, and since the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to sports. He rode a bicycle, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. But at the age of eleven, he had another seizure, and everything started all over again.
Doctors again tried different combinations of drugs, but this time nothing worked anymore, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since he always lost his senses during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped cycling and replaced downhill skis with cross-country skis and snowboard. Although from time to time the sport gave him a fit, he never completely gave it up. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan race, but together with a friend who had him constantly in sight to help in case of an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to specialists in the FN in Motol. The doctors there, after a series of examinations, concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a lesion from his brain-the source of epileptic seizures. "I had 2 operations in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain that sensed its activity, then they could only remove the bearing. It's been a few weeks of hell for me. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires sticking out of my head, which were connected to the computer, " recalls Honza.
The operation was successful, and the doctors removed a fairly extensive bearing. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. As opposed to how he is normally alive and communicative, this was a scary change, but fortunately, after a couple of days everything returned to normal, "the mom describes, adding:" a month and a half after the operation, he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors, it happens. He's been seizure-free for three months."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and began to cooperate with the company E, with which he travels around schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to the sport gradually. "I learn how to play sports properly, how to breathe well, so as not to expose the body to sudden stress, which, however, is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI water triathlon, which meets patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes, and which takes place this weekend 28. September 2019 at veselská piskovna. But maybe next year.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "argue" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raked in, the suppression of Science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like that 30-year-old
Tl; dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together

The French chef is suing Michelin for removing the star. I suffer from depression, he claims
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. With the publisher of the red guide, he intends to sue to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competence of Michelin inspectors, who, according to him, mistook saffron for cheddar. The first trial is scheduled for November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the alpine region of Upper Savoie lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious guide Le Guide Michelin will be sued, because the conclusion of the commissioners, according to him, was not properly justified. In addition, the removal of the asterisk, according to him, occurred without any notice. "Six months I suffer from depression. How dare you mess with the health of the cooks?"Veyrat said to the commissioners.
Michelin allegedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as that the chef put Cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and these gentlemen thought it was cheddar, because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have been working with Savoy ingredients with love," he protested against Veyrat's decision. The latter is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "you are scammers who only provoke disputes for commercial reasons."The indignant Veyrat does not understand" how they could afford to say that we put Cheddar in our soufflé". "They also offended our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning, " he huffed.
The distinguished chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore calls for the exclusion of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do this. "If the business remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Pullennec, international director of Michelin.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies that he does not yet have any meaningful accusation, and the lawyer will only help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr Veyrat communicates rudely with us. But we will carefully examine his comments, " he said.
In addition to La Maison de bois, Marc veyart owns two more three-star restaurants.
The man fell headfirst from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, which was interfered with by the rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
Employees of the regional operations center received an hour after midnight Saturday emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews of zzs-medical and medical-immediately went to the place.
Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics found that the 27-year-old man had fallen from the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vitkovice caught coal.
But not as it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of the ambulance teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance vehicle transported him to the further care of the Ostrava trauma center, said Lukáš Humpl, a spokesman for the zzs Ms region.
I am more concerned than I am about the coronavirus because of the inadequate response of the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical personnel are the first line of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Cutter.

Germany reports the first case of West Nile fever from a mosquito on its territory. It's linked to climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito. This was reported by the agency dpa. Until now, all the sick have contracted the virus while traveling or by contact with sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of the disease is related to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute reported that a seventy-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. His illness was severe and he was treated for brain inflammation in a hospital in Leipzig. He's healthy now.
The West Nile virus was first demonstrated in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it has spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe and in the 90s flights to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds, and also mosquitoes that get infected through their infected blood.
The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things happened at UFC 269.
The underdog Julianna Peña was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a slayer.
Charles Oliveira in the light heavyweight did not hesitate, demonstrated against Dustin Poirier a great choke and defended the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt by technical KO in the first round.
His opponent was also defeated by Sean O'malley.
A surprise no one expected.
This was brought by the women's bantamweight bout between the notorious Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes did not lose for seven years and sharpened her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her journey to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, penova did not force herself to make any more mistakes and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with the help of a lever on her arm.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pena got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and knock it off.
Thus, the American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, although Poirier did better, the card gradually began to turn around.
In the latter, Oliveira tried to be more active, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed very well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got the opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to tap the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the contrary, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'malley scored a masterful victory, having already put a hard right back on raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he conquered it with a series of precisely aimed blows, scoring the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is nothing complicated.
Most nouns in English express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is a masculine gender, feminine gender or middle gender.
But then there is also a fairly large group of nouns, in which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unstressed form.
For example, the words" swivel "or" hip "are both masculine and feminine, in the first they are pronounced according to the pattern" machine", in the second according to the pattern"song".
For another group of nouns, different forms are already in the first case of the singular, for example:" row/row"," kohlrabi/kohlrabi " or "potato / potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is not written, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that have penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally unstressed, but gradually they take over Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is both masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender unmoved, but in the masculine gender it has endings along the lines of "Castle".
Civilization in the allotted time
Recently, I remembered a beautiful "line" from one of the great stories of Simek with Grossman, which takes place partly in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she cries well, but on someone else's grave!"It occurred to me that many world politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving very similarly.
They behave as if the planet earth is ruled by humans. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its enormous forces like a sharp gust of wind the flame of a candle. Perhaps few of them look at the famous British and American natural science documents discussing the destructive capabilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to properly" blow up " and our advanced civilization will fall from it.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes have, according to leading volcanologists, "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it must happen once, occurred as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release at least a hundred times more into the atmosphere than has been saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
Therefore, it makes no sense to restrict CO2 production by force. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more drought-resistant. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of the ice age.
Bearing in mind the still insufficiently studied influence of the solar cycles on the earth's climate, there is only one reasonable conclusion to be drawn: let us strive to keep the earth as clean as possible, and let us try to adapt to other changes with which we cannot cope with the force with the least cost!

Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to make their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What, in fact, motivates refugees to an uncertain path?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
Coal will give way to gas and core. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says ExxonMobil's European boss
Renewable resources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with hn, Philippe ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the largest global oil producers, says this. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities, where unused energy from days when there is enough sun and wind, could be stored for later, are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, where 1,200 people work and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services necessary for the company's functioning.
Three months we did not see the blue sky and choked, describes a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been battling for four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How are the authorities there and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could prime minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
People find it uncomfortable to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to shut it down.
I don't personally know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how these people are often treated by their neighborhood or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It's become a trend for victims to finally open up about their trauma.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "much of the accusations are made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The soldiers are rehearsing, draw the curtains. China is preparing celebrations at the site of the massacre
The army has been rehearsing the parade over recent weekends. Shops in the center of Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close the curtains. On the empty streets, military vehicles rolled towards the square, and warplanes circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud of their country's military prowess. But one woman said that it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other countries.
Apparently, she was referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are approaching. But they may also have concerns in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-appointed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The South China Sea port of Xiamen has already shown a special light show on Thursday night. Located opposite the island of Taiwan, Xiamen is one of China's ten most innovative cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of prohibited things is growing. Already on it are drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, the Guardian newspaper pointed out. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo erases"harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the OAR) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who studies China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The people's Republic of China was formed in 1949, when the communists under the leadership of Mao Zedong won in the struggle with the Chiang Kai-shek nationalists, who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of 60. for years, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of a so-called cultural revolution. In June 1989, the Tiananmen Square regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy protesters, both students and workers, with tanks.
Since the late 70's. for years, China has increasingly taken over the elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (the monopoly of one party and the persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (the exploitation of workers).
Czech Republic flooded houses under construction, families do not have money to finish
Prices for building materials in recent weeks and months have risen by more than 30 percent.
A lot of people have gotten into a sticky situation because of this.
It does not have the means to complete the houses under construction and banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage lending, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move to unfinished and uncompleted houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent, " says BHS economist Štěpán křeček.
We build two or three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them happen to us.
For us as a construction company it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contracted, even if the material has risen in price.
So we do without earnings, " said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house will cost five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait, " added slivoň.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
There is a shortage of construction graduates in the Czech Republic, and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
More favorable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," said hamster.
We're having a good time, and we're gonna have a better time.
But real visions are missing, says commentator ČRO-mujrozlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to the classic celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
Apart from the prime minister and ano President Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the chamber of deputies spoke to the nation this year.
What did we learn?
The ministry plans a food lump sum from 2021. Nothing changes tax - wise
The Ministry of finance is preparing an amendment to the income tax act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of finance, a quarter of employees, or about a million people who do not yet receive food vouchers, will also be able to support meals.
According to the chairman of the Association of voucher operators, David rýc, however, even a number of small companies that do not have canteens or meal vouchers provide their employees with food, for example, by importing food or by agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change anything on the tax benefit. In addition, health and social insurance will not be paid from it, " Schiller said on Friday. It added that the threshold for the maximum employer contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The income tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal ticket price. The remaining part is paid by employees, in some cases also paid by the employer, but without a tax discount. The most advantageous value of a meal ticket for employees and employers this year is 123 CZK.
I have my own topic, which I have chosen, I follow up on the Bachelor, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I will write a written part.
Stateswomen are completely calm in our country, unless a person is a total macaque and something is left in his head, then this commission will not unnecessarily choke him on theory.
For example, I studied for a week at the State University and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which immediately came to me and I had it right.
Other than those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
In my opinion, it's great when at the end of the course there is an exam, which reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
Car tuning brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the title of a long text written for The Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative afterthought, it then writes that the medical community ignored the facts about obesity for decades and waged a ruthless (and also unnecessary) war against people with excess weight, which not only scarred public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. However, now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes states at the outset is that from knowing and knowing the facts to putting them into practice often leads a very long and tiring journey. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains already in the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that this would prevent disease. However, the British Navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear effect of fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century. but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take it into account. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they became mandatory only in the sixties, as well as the first confirmed deaths related to asbestos dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery - and no matter how significant it was - always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," writes Hobbes. In American society today, almost 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
At the same time, obesity is seen as a highly personal failure of the individual, which is said to burden the health sector and reduce GDP. The fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, the truth is that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. The personal meets the systemic, when, for example, at the faculties in the training of future doctors, he devotes only 19 hours from the entire study to nutrition. Which at the time 60 process calories that Americans receive come from ultra-processed food-that is, too processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized, in turn, is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people usually experience shorter check-ups, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.
However, overweight is far from just an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980, the proportion of obesity in 73 countries of the world has doubled and increased in 113. And during that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
All right, but don't block e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can put a similar statue of Putin next to the Winnie the Pooh statue.
You still have to get her to touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that insta throws sticks under the feet of artists.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a bare minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been bugging me a lot lately, so I might have to go down to TikTok, where a lot of the artists in my line of work are very successful, and they don't give a damn about it.
In the end, I might even like something more user-friendly that doesn't suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists
Statement of the Workers ' Party of Donbass
The union-yes, the break-up-no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind took place.
In the Bialowieza forest 8. December 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of 17. March 1991, with the open benevolent attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard to the people, signed an agreement that " the union of SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they" abolished " a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Bialowieza forest, destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, inhibited agriculture, broke away from the world's largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post – Soviet space, a series of Orange Revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria-all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a"vacuum of power".
Everything that was betrayed and surrendered in haste was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
Accident on D5: Highway closed collision of trucks
The incident was reported around 08: 00 on 22. kilometer in the direction of the threshold. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through the gas station, " said police spokeswoman Michaela Richter in the morning. Traffic was able to resume around 14: 30. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by the police.
A spokesman for the Central Bohemian firefighters, Petr Svoboda, said that one truck was carrying passenger vehicles and the other was carrying plastic pellets. "Due to the large impact, the displacement of the transported vehicles occurred, which firefighters had to first secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Another 200 liters firefighters managed to pump out. The accident was caused by a fuel leak caused by employees of the Department of the environment of the Beroun town hall. The rescue of the crashed vehicles and the motorway was provided by a private company, which also removed the contaminated soil.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it with the understanding that I'll put it in the fridge and make it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday-describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be 1 day before the date of consumption discounted to 69 CZK / kg - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself-nothing.
This bullshit that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
The Germans chose Keller to head the Football Union
The new chairman of the German football association became, as expected, the current head of the Bundesliga Freiburg Fritz Keller. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronomist and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he did not have an opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April due to an affair with undisclosed income. His other predecessors Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, in turn, will go to court for possible bribery in the awarding of the World Cup in 2006.
Keller said that one of the main goals will be to return the union's confidence and take it out of the crisis. "There will be no one man show, many people will bear the responsibility. The union is better than its reputation, " said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After the election to the head of the union, Keller left the post in Freiburg.
Děčín zoo rejoices at a small macaque
"Our group currently has seven members. Her youngest member came into the world 17. Augustus was born to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, fathered by a male Hitam. The first days after birth, the female carried the cub tightly pressed to the body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she gave birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the cub gradually began to postpone it for a little while and the caretakers have known for a few days that it is a male, " said zoo spokeswoman Alena houšková, noting that the Děčín zoo has successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are so-called endemites of the island of Sulawesi, that is, they do not live anywhere else in the world in the wild. A typical feature is a black coat and a plume on the head, according to which they got the name. Crested macaques live in rain forests, mainly at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. In the diet, the fruits of forest trees predominate very significantly, which complement the flowers and leaves. The need for protein is solved by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, birds ' eggs and chicks.
"Apart from natural enemies, which are pythons, everything else has been written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals, " the spokeswoman added.

Přerov: the driver crashed near the village of Kokory: he died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic accident occurred on Friday on a flat section between přerov and the village of kokory. The 28-year-old driver, Fabie, lost control and veered off the road. The car overturned on the roof, and he remained wedged under it. Sustained injuries did not survive.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle traveling in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," said přerov police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová to the server novinky.cz.
Now recently I went to Brno on hlavas and in the underpass of the ladies handed out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigade, they can not throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agita.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's too bad the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt herself a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to hang out with.
Or if I wanted to leave her apartment early, she would cry and beg me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year but then another six months passed and she started to go crazy.
I then ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lying to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down so she doesn't get any amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are rampaging around buying a cloud of tests and rushing to positive, who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
All we're doing is making it difficult for companies, carriers, and others to have their employees put under five days of house arrest in a random number generator.
In the west, they have already stopped this antics and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, war is new, and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing hazing.
I see the good old bastard's coming back.
After several years of oppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting returns to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at the university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't care, just get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk.
When the first money earned came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to earn, he had to rustle up several certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, which made one feel like a door-to-door pot salesman.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump right on every speck and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump them all together.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or " fat " account.
Milan jakubov: the army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Šándor
There is still confusion around the funeral of brigadier general Milan jakubov. Media in the week speculated that the military last farewell to the deputy director of military intelligence planned against the wishes of the family bombastic, as only soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Defense ministry spokesman Jan pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in touch with the family since the beginning, the Friday funeral date has been valid since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honors are valid. We will only deal with the possible involvement of the media with regard to the family," said pějšek on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and will not miss all military honors, including the flight of fighter jets.
But there is still a tense atmosphere around the final farewell to the favorite general. People who have worked with the general in the past will not participate in the mourning ceremony because of the decision of the organizers!
For example, the former head of military intelligence Andor šándor (62), who met Milan jakubov 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and a "good guy".
In addition, in recent years, he regularly met with him at the celebration of the anniversary of the founding of military intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan jakubov. "I personally would go to Milan jakubov's funeral," šándor told blesko. But he can't.
"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but are unlucky, because potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that this way to privatize the funeral is not right, " said the security expert. He does not care about the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public because of the secrecy of military leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not classified, and the leaders of military intelligence are not either, because they are promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media reports are true, and the family has indeed been put on the back foot by the military, that is, of course, a family matter. I personally would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and its wishes, " concluded Šándor.
Milan jakubov died on Saturday near Spindleruv Mlyn in a car accident. The head-on collision of the Milan rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch ch. (31).
The amateur racer in the corner should have driven into the opposite direction, Milan jakubov apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. COI reveals discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, erroneous information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fair sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the business. On its website, according to COI writes that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight years. "To the consumer's electronic query as to whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people come to the table, while it allowed English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in their capacity as consumers, were not allowed to sit down at a table in the restaurant and make an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this, " a spokesperson for the COI described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Since they are not yet legally terminated, the spokesman of the inspection could not give more detailed information on the said restaurants.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small proportion of the restaurants inspected in the second quarter. A total of 139 inspections were carried out by the CAI. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it found other irregularities in 64 cases. Most of these were shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Already on Wednesday, the inspection reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and café restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, the final fines of 60 000 crowns have already fallen.
I haven't seen much of that in the corporation I work for.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management and do not stick their nose into anything.
Regular evaluation is therefore somehow happening, in the form in which it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set yourself some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also within our company a little unique-there are departments what are more "corporate".
Sometimes one gets the feeling that we are such an almost-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so we don't bother much as long as the results are there.

Let the fans be positive, wishes Hasek. Sparta awaits šlágr in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit of possibilities, we will do everything in our power to succeed. We have to manage the game and the result," Martin Hašek promised in an interview for Club TV.
In the week the goal decided the Cup duel in Jihlava (2: 1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She's relieved, but the arcade is still hurting.
Even though the season slowly spills over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav jílek talked about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta who have very high quality players. We have a difficult game ahead of us, " warns Roman Procházka from Pilsen.
When the Spartans last arrived in the Strunce orchards, in mid-May, it was a definite matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a beating of 0:4, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While back then, before the match, the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points, now Sparta loses after ten games of the new season already nine points. Experiencing one of the worst entries to the season ever.
"It is not an easy situation for us, nor for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hasek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if they will be able to use Tetteh, who was given a two-match suspension in Pilsen, but appealed against it on Friday.
Costa, děkal, drchal, panák, pulkrab, zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who as the only one of the cadre remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011, remain on numerous sick leave.
The home team, who have won the last five games including Wednesday's Cup in hlucín, should be missing only midfielder čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the match by the defender Jakub Brabec, spartan bred.
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV. exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th century. and 15. 19th century, that is, from the time of the Roman and Czech King Václav IV., can be viewed today and Saturday by people in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library released them from their vaults to commemorate this year's 600. anniversary of Václav's death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in display cases in the mirror chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open on both days from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
Exhibition of documents entitled ad Mandatum Domini Regis: from the royal office and library of Wenceslas IV. prepared by the library together with the National Archives. Written heritage from the reign of Wenceslas IV. the national archive looks from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan vojtíšek said about the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, a work on agriculture by Peter de crescentiis, which is essentially an encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictine monks of the monastery of St. George in Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century. he listed the reasons why people should look at the exhibition, according to him.
The epistles of Peter of Blois will also be exhibited, where the semi-figure of the English king Henry II is depicted in the opening miniature h (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the master of Samson's history, who, in addition to the two volumes of the bible of Wenceslas IV. he also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin anthology of John Wycliff's treatises from about 1411 to 1414.
From the library of Wenceslas IV. not a single book has been preserved in the Czech territory. This library, according to experts, was one of the most extensive and also the most beautiful book collections in central Europe at that time, because the young king wanted to build a representative library that would match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library ceased to exist soon after Václav's death. Apparently, it was looted or destroyed during the conquest of the castle by the Hussites. But several codes were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian national library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called Live and not only in the form of the Digital Library Manuscriptorium," said the director of the National Library Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition entitled What is hidden under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will also be opened free of charge in Klementinum.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a pretty dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without major hiccups.
Coming to terms with the idiotic attitude of a large part of the population in all its strata, I have a problem with this until now.
On vaccinations (tomorrow!) I'm most excited because thanks to him, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not jerks.
He would be deprived of the office of President and the capacity to regain it.
But the chances of that actually happening are, as others here have mentioned, very slim.
Besides, I'm not sure shredding a file could even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the president of a republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of a state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: the number of people under 35 who are without sex for a whole year is growing
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based People, reports the website of the daily dailymail.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sexual life rose from eight to 21 percent.
The number of women aged between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sexual intercourse in the last year is higher than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for family studies (ifs) showed.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age who report not having had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly," said ifs researcher Lyman Stone.
Among people in marriage, sexual activity is more common, for 2021, only 5% of them said that they had been without sex for the past year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
"It is true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior shifts this trend," Stone says of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60 %.
Among the "less religious", the trend has risen from 10 to 20%, " stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that people without jobs or with lower incomes are less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"So it turns out that young Czechs have a little more confidence in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher proportion of wrong answers," said Jaroslava palendalová, director of Kruk.
Men and young high school or college students are more likely to trust their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn most about the functioning of financial affairs from parents (37 percent), self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in the third place from teaching at school (21 percent).
Questions around finances consult with parents mainly women, while information on the internet is more often sought by men. Obtaining information about finances from parents prevails in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Practically minimal influence is exerted by prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key, " said palendal.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of the young.
Clearly, young people are faced with the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, their own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money rather, without savings and their own housing.
The strategy of saving and investing in fixed tangible assets is professed by 94 percent of respondents. This applies across all age groups of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The survey strategy is 100% supported by people in a marriage with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income above CZK 30,000 per month want to enjoy themselves more.
The whole issue of covid-19 is whether society should force a part of the population to behave in ways that they don't want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question, on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
I. E.for example, the question of whether if we do not order them and they die, then it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated, and he ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the CPC, is saying something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
The Brno grand prix? There is a risk of increasing the price of tickets
The most expensive item is annually before the grand prix forlisting fee. This year was about one hundred and fifteen million. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the grand prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less balance the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the plant is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. A great price there attracts visitors even from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Turan airport or the exhibition centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money, " the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for organizing, increasing registration fee for the promoter company Dorna
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- current status: negotiations on a new contract for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of public administration Filip hrůza, the organizers now have to evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The grand prix is sucking money out of public budgets for other things. To some extent, however, it is a political and not an economic issue, " he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motor event may be even higher. In the game there is a variant of increasing the landing fee almost twice.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on how much the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst-case scenarios come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount, " admitted the mayor of Brno, Markéta vaňková.
As the daily rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the grand prix. "The condition of Dorny is that advertising must be placed in places that do not occupy cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then a company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor, " explained vaňková.
The organizers can also get more money from tickets in the following years. "We need to sit down and say what the costs actually will be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets to this, " said Petr vokřál, an opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor of Brno.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"It was a great school for all who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The fact that I have something Romani in me from my father made me completely enchanted, " said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
He has much fresher memories than the series first step for the role of the decorator in the new film national class. Cina revealed that the director Stepan Altrichter had to entice him a lot. "The work was difficult, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but fun at the same time. It was shot on national Avenue, where I drove a car as a non-driver. A lot was also filmed in the southern city of Prague, " he said of the Czech-German co-production.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia award for his role in the production of the little prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "That's not how I feel. I still see myself as a kid just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me, " he revealed, adding that he did not even think about a thank you speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a child, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined myself speaking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To love each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the Czech Lion award, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So he did not last long and lay on the ground. He made it a priority. He had a workshop Vančurova stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
The title was received by Costa Rica for several reasons. For a start, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050-however, many countries have committed to this under the Paris agreement. The Central American state with a population of about five million produces only 0.4 percent of world emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
The official Tourist Organization reports that already about 95 percent of energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica worked on them for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with diverse fauna and flora, covering more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist draws. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and sets an example for other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us, " the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot, given the small size of the country (51, 100 square kilometers). Rain or mist forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitoresque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Czechia without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski area operators can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country skiing jizera fifty.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will the lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about the Lord's prayer.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we went down one of these rather wide streets, and we don't see anyone in the middle-the followers of the hare krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I escaped, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul, " she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, new German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly show that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be solved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy group, which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to dpa, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by Lukashenko's regime.

CSIS are investigating the case as damage to someone else's property and disorderly conduct, for which they face up to three years in prison.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun, who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her license for not giving priority in driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked her for help.
Then the police came for sister Celestina.
They gave her a breathalyzer test, and after they found she had more than two pints in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Slovaks have succeeded, for racist insults only pay a fine
The Slovak football association has succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for racism of fans. The national team was originally without spectators to play the match of the qualification of the European Championship with Wales, instead now the union will only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about 387 thousand).
The disciplinary commission of UEFA punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behavior of fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting trustees of the Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2:1. Both unions closed the stadium for one match and fined Slovakia 20 thousand euros, Hungary 67 thousand euros.
Slovaks after the appeal received only a fine of 15 thousand euros for insulting political cries. The next match of the national team in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales 10. October in Trnava will be made available to fans.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of Ayotzinapa university disappeared, despite an extensive investigation, the case has not yet been clarified. Allegedly, the students were to be detained by the police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened next, according to the investigation, but the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, APTN reports.
On Thursday, a memorial procession was held in Mexico's capital, families wanted to express their frustration at the fact that they still could not find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
The mostly peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not hesitate to destroy monuments, set fires around the city and blew out windows.
Even before the march, president Andres Manuel López Obrador said that he would do everything to catch them, and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained in the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, the investigators allegedly had to torture the suspects, APTN adds.
Hugo the dog does his best.
But Juraj šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies looked in American stories about dog lovers.
But in doing so, they forgot the essential thing: the regularities of the film craft.
After the cheesy film by F. brabce Gump - the dog who taught people to live, another film is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer and director in one person Juraj šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film here I watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, and so they begin to invite dog handlers, Julia's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) struggled with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julia, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and if the correct "constellation" comes, copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined-on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmir, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the she is taken to the hospital by her family so that a miraculous process of healing by a dog can take place in the heart of the Sumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what content pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A couple of shoplifters from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen coming to the den in search of "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the guest house will, of course, get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slacking as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
In addition, the creators explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters of the characters and the point and directorial guidance.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is muddy.
However much Lukáš vaculík, Jitka ježková or Nela boudová try to settle their party, they do not have much to play for.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the bohemian nature of the cameraman Vladimir holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long membership in the club of dachshund breeders - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
For a good family picture there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur-conceived stunt would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant abuse from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see how much shit you understand, but that's only because you've never tried.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want it, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to kids like that all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in his case a part-time job.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency this week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under discussion, and a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the deputy chairman of the association of travel agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan pope, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which of them it will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will depend on the German owner," he told CTK today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, CK also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own account, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised to pay its clients, according to the pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the pope described to CTK one of the cases when the hotel there threw out all the tourists offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German and who to the Czech company. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel despite the fact that the local Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook last year increased its sales to CZK 995 million, almost 21 percent more year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the contrary, the company's net profit decreased by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. From previous years, however, the company was left with an outstanding loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions-in addition to CK neckermann, it is also the Global Travel company Lufthansa city center.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have noted at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli meteorological service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasim Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are gusty and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, has filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers warned of drought long ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israeli water authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are more tank cars.
Water lines and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker truck driver, reported in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military strike against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, staying in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring "any progress" and world powers " understand that the Iranians are playing with them."

About three years ago, this happened to me.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wants from me.
In the end, I found that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, so I gave the lady a little more doubts and questions, and finally thanked and left.
You can call me a scumbag, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Museum in sEmily with an exhibition returns to the Velvet Revolution
Imitation of a normalization room with a TV in which footage of the brutal crackdown of police officers against students from 17. November 1989 in Prague. This, too, is in the new exhibition of the museum in sEmily, which is dedicated to the velvet revolution. "The basis is to imagine what happened in sEmily after the events at Národní třída," said Tomáš chvátal, curator of the exhibition.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere with the fact that the first demonstration was held in sEmily on 22. November, and then every day gradually packed up more people," he said. Among the most active were at first a group of local dissidents around Miroslav matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the spouses of the grandfathers, who spread the petition several sentences. According to chvátal, the civic forum was also formed relatively quickly. "One of the specifics is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the civic forum," said the curator.
Visitors should be drawn into the current events in the city by about 50 photographs, taken 30 years ago by Karel bárta. A video of the 27th general strike has also been preserved. November 1989 filmed by František tomíček, which will be played in the loop throughout the exhibition. At the demonstration, Ivan the voice also spoke and sang. The semilsk archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "They said: let's not get drunk with a roll, from trough to trough, we do not want violence," chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very rapid at that time, for example, already in December the people in the All-Russian vote decided that the square would be riegrovo and abolished the previous name gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to the contemporaries and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the Museum of the workers ' movement at that time," chvátal said. One room is supposed to evoke the feeling of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition, in turn, is devoted to what was after the velvet revolution. It is aimed at the first free elections. "We papered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters with us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with a beautiful motto each for his village," added the curator.

Skiers on the weekend went to the mountains, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves at the lifts covid certificate.
While skiers do not complain about customers ' lack of interest, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to cross-country trails and ski slopes at the weekend.
Skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," the director of the Sports Complex Ještěd Jakub Hanuš praised the interest.
Hundreds of people set off for the first weekend skiing in the new season also in jeseníky.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in branná in šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfekt, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or within the period after having contracted covid-19.
Except for exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René hroneš from the Skicentre špindlerův mlýn told CTK.
"We recorded only units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra bokišová from the Opava shop skiopava.
A greater onslaught is expected in the period of ski courses.
David šinták, the managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that covid-19 is not as interested in renting ski equipment as it used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on borrowed time.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, šinták told CTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, rental in the novako na Bozi Dar area is in great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested now have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said the operator of the complex pavlína nováková.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic, according to her, is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must be able to live a quality life here, like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Abroad, smart and clever people leave, who have no property here.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
With the rest, however, absolutely agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began in such a way that one fine day Orbán won, he ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a couple of tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the elections at all.
If it's a bad place to live, some traditional v4 freak can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose property can not be put on a plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood over a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand The Crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the actor on social networks posted a bloody photo of his face.
Is this a real wound, or is this a trial for filming?
London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srnc worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
Missing Czech woman according to her on Sunday 28. November around 19: 45 left work and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by 3. December someone from her associates.
Srncova, according to British media, worked as a" nurse's assistant "at the Evelina London children's hospital, which belongs to the hospital association guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
The public is also being urged to cooperate by Harriet Harman MP, who on Saturday drew attention to Srnc's case at a press conference.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care," Harman said.
Police have previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC News website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (IE CA 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine in this way either.
These are not "huge amounts", but CA 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what makes you think Russia wants a war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out on so many points that I do not even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily: D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the" concentration " at the border would correspond to.

Healthy snack / lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a break of 30 minutes and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as much as possible healthy and dietetic.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy a maximum of pizza buns and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so, unfortunately, it is.
And it's not about trees, which you must necessarily see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're banning us from off-piste skiing, but it's one of them.
Confessions of Dara about the relationship with the bear: I did not look forward to this at all
Czech showbiz pond from Friday does not live by anything other than revealing the relationship of Dara rolins and Pavel Nedved.
They have been dating since the summer, the famous football player even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a lengthy message explaining why she hid her love from them for a long six months.
"I dare to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, Sorry, Not a bear," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
She said he was the one who hit on her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the interest of the public, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both did not look forward to, but we knew that it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it's the ones who don't care at all and it pops out of the can, or us whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if any of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend fit together, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
I mean, that's what you want, that's what bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
There, in turn, Nedvěd serves for a long time as vice-president of the Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for the finalization of Nedved's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they are not married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us this, thank you.
We, too, are only human, we have families, children, pasts and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him.for better or for worse, concluded Rolins.
The opening of the pumpkin world delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová ves u leštiny (havlíčkobrodsko) - a farm in Nová ves u leštiny in havlíčkobrodsko has opened a pumpkin world for more than a month today. Decorated with thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins, the garden is dominated by massive orange pyramids. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, this year begins a week later, because the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipkov family have matured longer. Even now there are a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava pipková told CTK today.
The pips grow many kinds of pumpkins, but the weather hasn't been good for them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed, and some species did not come out. "As usual, we have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some varieties have failed for gourmets," said Pipková. Nevertheless, the farm can choose from several varieties, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and chiseling decorations through cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental gourds of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig up plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. Pumpkin world Pipkovi open regularly since 2010, past seasons attracted thousands of people. Decoration from pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or mazes made of logs. Visitors will also see animals bred on the farm. It will be open daily until 3. November.
Details of the event can be found on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. About other options for finishing the pumpkin in the kitchen they are told by the visitors themselves. "A lot of cooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired too," said Pipková. She noted that some housewives also pickled pumpkins sourly like cucumbers.

Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found lodgings together, which seems to me like the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like vranovská, francúrská, etc., this is a pretty bad address), even some parts of židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the District of Veveří is very student, královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it is close to most of the faculties of but (I do not know where exactly you start).
I have never rented, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise with Brno as such, if you still have some information missing :)
This is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it out of their own pocket or they go by the state and the state pays for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will add a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and, thanks to this, he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against having an abortion is the same to you as a vote against having a statue in the square?
Neckermann cancels all flights, it concerns five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann travel agency, has not filed an insolvency petition," šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from 26. September to 6. October.
According to šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. About 800 clients of Neckermann, who are currently abroad, according to him, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic is ensured by their scheduled flight".
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary that clients immediately contact the SOS line of CK neckermann," šrámek added.
The Thomas Cook crash happened on Monday. In August of this year, the travel agency concluded an agreement on the basis of which creditors were to invest 900 million pounds in the company.
Half of the amount was to be received from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. The latter, on the basis of this, was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. Already 20. however, in September, information appeared that creditors demanded from the travel agency to receive a reserve of 200 million pounds, otherwise the deal falls. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging / digitizing that (even longtime professionals) either somehow throw it by eye, or write something in the manner of XXX *** or ... (by convention) and make a note that it is illegible.
The truth is, it's pretty legible in this case, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on the coin.
PS: isn't it more of a Odryská empire (kingdom) than odrynská?
PSS: someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'theme' of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is a smile.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, for this anyway some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing high-standard relationships.
Besides, it's quite interesting with English, after GB's withdrawal from the EU.
Trump Considers Canceling the registration of Chinese shares in the US
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking permission for Chinese companies to trade on the stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. The shares of the companies concerned on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, pulling the entire market with it.
The stock withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. Thus, he confirmed the report of Bloomberg, which shortly before caused a shock in the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and iQiyi lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US Nasdaq and NYSE exchanges. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.
Bloomberg noted that the exact mechanism that would ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from US exchanges has not yet been worked out. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, in which they impose tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative consequences for the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using Tariffs to try to force Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC television, trade negotiations between the US and China are expected to resume 10. October. His goal is to end the trade war.

The launch of the new toll is not threatened, reports the Kremlin. But there is a change of operator in the game
The Ministry of transport on Friday began preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a backup plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract was finally terminated. In addition, the state is also preparing other provisional solutions in case the tender could not be completed on time. On Facebook, this was stated by Transport Minister Vladimir kremlik (for yes).
The office for the protection of competition (úohs) on Thursday banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/skytoll consortium, with a one-year delay. The ministry will file a lawsuit against it.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not threatened. Starting today, we are launching the preparation of a new transparent tender, the subject of which will be the services of the operation of the new toll system, which is now being finalized by the CzechToll and skytoll consortium," the minister said.
Thus, the state would look for the operator of the currently prepared toll in the tender, which will be launched from this December. So it would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system, which is now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare a new tender in time. "Based on my experience with the toll tender process, I am deeply convinced that the úohs is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and transfer the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the 12-month period," he said.
In addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a provisional solution that would solve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
Thus, the state will probably not take advantage of the offer presented to it by the current toll administrator Kapsch in the past few days. An Austrian company offered the state to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that it believes that a backup plan will not be needed. Therefore, the ministry will file an appeal against the decision of the antimonopoly authority.
On Thursday, the úohs issued a decision in which it banned the performance of the toll contract. But the ban will come into force only one year after the legal force of the decision of the authority. This is not final and can be appealed to the president of the office. The ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
The CzechToll/skytoll consortium won last year's tender for a new toll system and its operator. It succeeded in a toll tender with a bid of 10.75 billion crowns for a ten-year operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the tender process and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the tender with an offer of over CZK 13 billion.
"A frightening result of the study."Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of the population of Austria fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for the introduction of a ban on the construction of mosques. For more monitoring of the Centers of Islam, 80 percent of those surveyed.
The majority of Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices and say that the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "such a propensity for ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. Religious freedoms granted to Muslims are in danger of being curtailed."
In believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without higher education or seniors over the age of 75. The most welcoming, on the contrary, are green voters, people under the age of 30 and college students.
According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the interior, about 700 thousand Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million people. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized here as a religion since 1912.
I don't get the hate on cejl.
I've been working there for three years, and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never any problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly set foot there in his life.
Yes, most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they don't have to :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, then I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix slováček (78) without Dada and mistress gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle at the advent wreath, Felix slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I have seen the lady's wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist to blesko, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house on the vineyards, where Dada after his departure was left alone.
Slováček still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with anička, Felix and both grandsons.
Video: Felix slováček and Lucie gelemová: together again!
Felix slováček and Lucie gelemová: together again!
But we kept talking, so it wasn't Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video to the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to have fun, says slováček, who was happy to meet Lu .ko Sobota's wife Adriana or singer Kamila nývltová.
And he made it very clear.
"A travesty of justice."The scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sitting in a Turkish prison
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that pollution of water, soil and food in some industrial areas in the west of the country is associated with an increased incidence of cancer among local residents.
The researchers mentioned in particular the dilovasi industrial zone, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, international criticism despite
Despite the clear conclusions of the study, it seemed to Sika that the government was not taking any action on the matter. Therefore, he wrote several articles about the research in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began to prosecute him for leaking classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable, " the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing people sounding the alarm through the courts, the Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health problem," said Andrew Gardner of AI's Turkish branch.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental regulations despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions.
Following the failed 2016 coup, the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a large wave of arrests. Almost 80, 000 people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities also laid off or completely dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organisations accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute opponents. But the authorities argue that these are measures necessary to ensure national security.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other force that could be deployed to hospitals in a crisis.
The police are few and can not afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level is not.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for quite a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape does not have to be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountainous and foothill areas, less rainfall is recorded even in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought that prevails in much of central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage our land also amplifies the impact.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Traveler Zikmund or general Boček. The Senate handed out commemorative medals
Sixty-nine-year-old Boček, who was a fighter of the British air force during the Second World War, thanked on behalf of all those awarded for the awarded medals. "The Senate was one of the first not to forget and does not forget about war veterans," he said, among other things. "The award I received today also belongs to my friends who are no longer among us," he added.
Kubera in his speech warned against the division of society. "Let us not forget our roots, which unite and shape us all, whether we want to or not. After all, it is precisely from these values that our successful present is based, " Kubera said.
The prizes were awarded to cardiologist and most cited Czech scientist Renata cífková, longtime rector of Tomas Bata University in Zlín Petr sáha, geologist, writer and traveler and popularizer of science Václav cílek, president of the Czech Biathlon Union and vice president of the world biathlon union Jiří Hamza and František paštěka. The upper house appreciated his heroism-in January this year he saved the life of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter, pulling them out of a burning car. Former presidents of the upper chamber Libuše benešová and Milan Štěch also received medals.
Together with Jiří hanzelka, Zikmund undertook a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a lot of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of Radio Free Europe, now he cooperates with public media. Steigerwald also works as a playwright and screenwriter, the musician kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission for supervising the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
The medal was awarded in advance to Luboš Perek, an astronomer and emeritus head of the UN Office for space affairs, on the occasion of his 100th birthday in July. By the end of the year, Madeleine Albright, a Czech native and first secretary of state of the United States, and Roger Scruton, a British philosopher and political scientist who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called underground university during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia, are to receive the same award.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could hold people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and especially minefields. The images in which he is wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face have become iconic. And even then no one could have guessed that a few months later the princess of human hearts in a tragic car accident in Paris will breathe her last breath.
Now her younger son Harry has also scored, having gone to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine-clearing post in Diric, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very thoughtful. He certainly did not avoid the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost at the age of only 13.
Harry gave a speech on the spot, where he praised the efforts of the HALO Trust, which works to defuse minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community to find peace, with which comes opportunities, " he said, and also appealed to save and preserve wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on his official Instagram account:" the Duke is honored to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, to learn about their tireless mission and to speak for all those about whom she (Diana) felt they needed most to be heard, even if the issue was not exactly popular worldwide, " the Sussex royal
But royal fans may regret that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such an expedition for the memories of Diana. The two of them have had separate agendas for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to jeopardize his beloved family at any cost.

Yeah it will be so, I can barely keep in skates on the ice, I don't know what it is to play hockey and this tactic (what I tried in the Franchise Hockey manager) is also a total fool.
And whether you're a hockey team" Medvedev Russia "or" Lama China " so to lose by two goals even though you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is leveled.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who prick, what the judges notice do not notice whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it is probably with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And IMHO if it were the other way around, it is as always another time, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be a classic "voni lost" vs "we won".
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha
The world championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana mezuliáníková was eliminated in the 800 metres and neither Rod player Romana maláčová nor hammer thrower Kateřina šafránková, who defended her eighth place in London last year, qualified.
The race on Friday will be completed by the hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters on the third attempt and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 CM, 450 CM was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 CM.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship only at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth run on the penultimate sixth place and even the time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her to advance to the semifinals. She was one and a half seconds behind this year's maximum. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was in a fight with my opponent in the corner, which took a lot of energy out of me. I thought I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start running again, so that was a little awkward. I can't be completely satisfied, " said the Czech representative.
She was glad that in the finish line she overtook at least one rival. "She really wasn't doing well, so every opponent she beat was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately, " she added. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie nanyond from Uganda in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best eight-hundredth runner of recent years, Caster Semenya, is missing from the spring, who has too high a level of testosterone in her body, but, like some other runners, she refuses the treatment that has been prescribed by the rules of the IAAF since this year.
In the heats of the 100 meters confirmed the role of the number one favorite American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one below the limit of ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is aiming to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semi-finals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the number two in this year's charts with a performance of 9.86, did not start and was expected to compete with Coleman, who has a 9.81 this season.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form already in the qualification of distance runners, who reached the distance of 840 cm with the first jump. No athlete has made it this far in World Cup qualifying in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's table by 865 CM.
The Slovenians beat the Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the Premier title of European champions. With the support of almost 12 thousand boisterous fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions defeated the poles 3:1 and are the first finalists.
Who will be called up in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team performed much more compactly in the semifinals than the Polish world champions. These included only the beginning of the opening set and, with luck, the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players surpassed themselves in defense and from the players in red and white jerseys, only the native of Cuba, León, actually scored.
However, in the Home lineup, both smecters Čebulj and urnaut presented themselves in life form, as well as the second all-rounder štern, who soon replaced the lackluster Gasparini. The poles paid for the fact that they won all previous matches at this euro in a masterful manner, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy battles in the playoffs with both Bulgarians and Russians.
With the poles this August, the Slovenes lost in the Olympic qualifier in Gdansk 1:3, but they returned the defeat at home. But now the sold-out arena in Ljubljana Stožica will leave. After today, however, they have a certain second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championship Slovenians finished eighth, only behind the Czech national team.
Planet-friendly. The night of scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit CTU and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University I would visit the Department of anatomy at the Faculty of medicine, which is not accessible to the public at other times," advises National Coordinator of the night of scientists Jitrenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try their hand at working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to čzu and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navrátilová. Nine laboratories will also offer guided tours. The motto of this year's night of scientists is "friendly to the planet".
Coronavirus: the number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
Saturday 11. the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections in December.
5766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 per 100 000, 871 per 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since 13. October.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, this is the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing the "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the British health security authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died on Omikron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson cabinet minister argued that the quiz took place "virtually", via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees in Downing Street, gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is growing to remove Johnson from the prime minister's post.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is facing elections in the spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European importance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes constituency boundaries to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is so that everyone can in practice vote where he wants.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from the constituencies decided to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about not if Fidesz would win, but how much, and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and seats.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will not in an effort to keep the power play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of László Kövér, president of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, was leaked to the independent media, in which he tells secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.

I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, parents mom does not have much patience, I do not either, dad has it for a long time, but then it blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a little terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they no longer knew.
I have a tendency to deal with things by force, I used to fight quite a bit when I was little, now I hit something for discharge, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the arm (so I don't get too much in the face), so never anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I can't tell the extent of my explosiveness, but I'm sure my upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer" educational, " but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks up something, it is probably impossible not to at least slightly prznit their children, so I do not blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the op should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call those who make laws in this quality cunts.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're worried about a power outage?
Can you really count on the fact that people want the product and buy it, and you will have something to pay the mortgage on?

Scientists in their study are looking for toddlers with a congenital defect called valgosity of the ankles
Valgosity (displacement) of the ankles is a congenital defect that affects five to ten percent of children. As a rule, it is treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by both healthy children and children with a diagnosis, to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless, " explains Marta gimunová, head of research at the mu faculty of sports studies.
Parents of both groups of children can apply for the study through the website, where the registration form and all information is available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty children healthy. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes, and half will not.
"The moment when parents should sign their child is the moment when he starts to take the first independent steps, typically letting go of furniture, for example, which he clings to when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, half of the participants also include wearing the tested shoes," notes gimunová.
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
What will the process mean for Slovakia?
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges hradecký bek Nedomlel
In his case, increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defenseman Richard nedomlel will go in Friday's game against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartans player is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, even though they have never worn the Prague club jersey.
"Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull out," says Hradecky Bek before Game 5. an extra-League round.
Hradec Králové will try to stretch its winning streak, which currently counts three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the fans most appreciated, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can not watch the matches that were. We need to focus on the matches that are ahead of us now, and play in them the same, if not better, " warns the Hradec Kralove defender.
Hradec Králové should not look back on last year's record with Sparta. In three of the four matches they lost, they took points only once after winning in Prague after overtime. In addition, the leadership of Sparta in the summer brought several significant reinforcements and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we will talk about, this year they are really charged," admits nedomlel before the first match of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinity.

Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie bílá (53) is a seamstress by profession and her own name is Hana zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie bílá knew from a fairly early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a young girl, she performed at the cultural house in her native otvovice, where she still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. At that time, a singer was born in me, " she admitted to Pulse Radio.
Her father, however, was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to take the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said,' craft girl, craft. Get your feet on the ground!'He even talked me into going to the local Glassworks. The glassworks are down, I'm pretty good. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs with money," she added with a laugh.

Commentary by Jan Šindelář: managing railways as a company
The election of heaven, although apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the inability of the state to give the roads a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, it does not change because one of the members resigned. Provisorium lasts.
The selection procedure itself was a farce from the beginning, because the requirements for candidates were significantly relaxed, especially in the field of practice. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have been reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced guys from the management of logistics giants and transport enterprises. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, those concerned know that they played only the role of an epic backdrop in the political game.
Perhaps the heavenly will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best boss of the railways of all time. However, at least in the beginning, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of a political newsstand. České dráhy is facing a difficult time, having to cope with competition in the liberalisation of the market and the lack of staff in operation. Missing drivers, shifters and mechanics. What is the motivation for further work and respect for management, when the state behaves in the top management like an elephant in a china shop?
The second important group is creditors. We will see how they interpret the games at the head of the tracks next spring, when the tracks will defend the rating. What is certain is that lenders perceive instability. The sad thing is that every year someone else comes to Moody's to defend the rating. The agency did not escape frequent changes in the management of railways and political influence on the company, it criticized them already this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement coined the slogan that the state should be run as a business. For starters, it would be enough to run one large state-owned company as a company, and not as a state. České dráhy is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if they were led by the best. They applied, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political issue. But then we can forgive ourselves for the competition antics.

The next government ends, and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of prime minister Andrej Babiš is over and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the government interrupted the consideration of the draft submitted to the government by the Ministry of industry and trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities united in the platform against deep-sea storage, but also with the union of cities and municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options in deciding on the repository, which is promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law from the minister Karel Havlíček, which the platform has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities in particular: the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the choice of a site for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the management of storage sites to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a project almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians in permit procedures.
The proposal lacks a system of compensation settings for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its authorization and operation.
Representatives of municipalities, realistically, according to today's legal norms, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their observations or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of exploration or construction work.
The Codecision of Municipalities called for by the platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s. r. o., concluded by the SÚRAO and following on from the contract with lawyer Jan zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is expected to be almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from hrádek and spokesman for the platform against deep-sea disposal, said: after the ministers of industry, who only postponed the settlement of the position of local governments in the search for deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the union of cities and municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a major construction project in the same way as the directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep underground storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep underground storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for potential storage is subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.

And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun newspaper.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body made furniture crack.
"I shoved everything in my mouth," the actor said in 2018 in an interview with AARP.
I wanted to take it slow this time.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can no longer afford to sit still, said for ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If this is some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was a formal text or a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain boss.
To all this, there are more kinds of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc.has several bosses, right, and so the "boss" is something like the Lord / Ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all needed to defeat in order for the game or level to be completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like half-life, where bosses are, but the player does not directly deal with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
Well, then there are the mini-bosses.
It is a simple monosyllable to somehow translate boss just can not, Czech and other languages it somehow does not solve (interesting is only Catalan, which translates boss as the final opponent).
It is, in short, for a story or game in general, a significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of some level or task.
And where are the spectators? Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, since the pilgrimage to Doha, athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the rousing atmosphere that prevailed at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite to the "biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified her backdrops will be are growing.
"Tickets for the destination are sold out for all the evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The top floor of the Khalifa stadium with a total capacity of 40 thousand spectators is already covered with colorful sails, on which the flags of 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar went to a territory where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it does not have sunk roots.
So let's not be surprised that last week only 50 thousand tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, that is, in terms of less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered sections of the stands. Therefore, according to sources of the British newspaper giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) give out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, and also to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF Athletics Association, comments positively: "this is how we can inspire the next generation."
Rich Qatar in the past won the world championships in handball and cycling, after athletics will come football in 2022. The financial offers of the oil power will always be lucrative even for the rich sports federations. Such is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and leave aside the absence of fans in the stadium, we will not prevent a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by the IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the whole scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally begin in October for athletes.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this at least with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises ultra-modern and attractive championships. That it's 37 degrees right now? Already now the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are also intended to give television viewers a detailed look at what is happening in the athletes in hundredths of a second before the starter shot and just after it.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra srncová since 3. December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She's been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since 7. December.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28. November.
British police have been looking for her since 3: 00. December.
Because of her, Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kateřina rendlová confirmed.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman, a Labour MP, was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in putting up flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are extremely worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by a Tesla agent.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, attacks increased significantly.
A large campaign in connection with the Tesla agent we have seen 18. November.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is supposed to arouse the user's attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as a copy of the 11,2021 receipt corrections...exe, " said Martin jirkal of ESET.
Spyware contains features that scan internet browsers and other programs, for example, email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
Malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it subsequently sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the invaders is growing again.
In November, spyware formbook also remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November intercepted rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October data, formbook weakened slightly in November, but still stands behind almost a fifth of all detections.
Attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3 days., 10. and 15. November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an extension .exe, which bore the name request for specification.
However, the name účenka also continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and dampening of activity is registered by security analysts with the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major attack campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.
The demos of today's smart guys who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated jerks.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Judging by the footage of the parade along the embankment and from my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of about 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment, as well as the bridge and the opposite embankment communication.
That is means people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek mokrý.
That the constant discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only the antivaxers themselves, the antirouškáři and co. they couldn't fill or pay for a parade this big.
The actions of the Dead Dog Association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and equipment.
It is difficult to say what movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-and multi-dose one.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or a centre-right movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, since it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action of scientists, to which humanity is rightfully proud.
End of stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has instructed the formation of a new government Kirill Petkov from the anti-corruption movement we continue to change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the last government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties, preaching the fight against bribery and abuse of power, could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From the "secretly" taken footage is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, fears grew over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, for whom the London police have been searching for several days.
Petra srncová was last seen two weeks ago on her way home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her current employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived also calls for information about the worker of the children's hospital.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry a lot about her," Lucy O'connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srnc worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
Missing Czech woman according to her on Sunday 28. November around 19: 45 left work and headed home to the district of Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by 3. December someone from her associates.
Srncova, according to British media, worked as a" nurse's assistant "at the Evelina London children's hospital, which belongs to the hospital association guy's and St Thomas'.
"We are extremely worried about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of medical institutions said in a Twitter post.
"We would encourage anyone who may have any information that could help locate her to contact police," the statement continued.
Zdeněk dvořáková kocourková, an amateur painter of children's rooms in šumperk (and also a regional pirate councilor), was given an anonymous notice that he was infringing copyright with his paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of krteček in šumperské pokočíky do not violate the law.
In the mouth above the Elbe, the moon saw a hole in the road in the form of a channel without a hatch.
It was a matter of life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it allegedly did not respond, the hole went green.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to "deal with the situation intensively".
Microplastics have reached the human intestines, confirmed for the first time a study
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. A team led by Vienna University Professor Philipp Schwabl has published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human stool. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia-however, tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in the samples of all subjects studied. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.
And it would actually be kind of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the cosmetics industry, or produced by breaking up larger pieces-are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and sodas; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the digestive system of man is only officially confirmed. There were about 20 microplastic particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness knows that this is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is-and what effect microplastics have on the "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up, for example, in the liver. "This is the first ever study of its kind and has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of the occurrence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health, " says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, no other solution is known than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult-the first task facing governments and authorities will at least be to stop its steep increase. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than today. The current rate is a staggering million bottles bought per minute. Around eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans every year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infects the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already adopted restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example, has banned plastic bags under the threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering small-scale bans (the well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the environment is heading in the same direction. But critics say that such measures, while Nice, are completely inadequate.
