Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients finally face their fear in the most extreme way.

Previously, the target date was the end of January.
He said the U.K. government will provide additional support to ensure vaccination campaigns are also accelerated in the country's Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Content warning: I'm going to write something a little detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think that we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything about such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes....
But even talking in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help with this in every case.... I know I can't.
But it never makes it any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.

Basketball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg's derby debacle at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be counted on.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in the belly".
This did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby still more than the bare result the way of the appearance disappointed.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma is representative: The three-point quota was just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from young John Patrick) on no less than 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and didn't implement what we trained for."

While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants avoided a total debacle and came up to eight points, after they had already trailed 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to complain.

Help with first own campaign
Congratulations to Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffin's Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and tripping over my own feet at the very first Encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the rest of the plot is to unfold.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Persuade, Act, Threaten, Spot the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers.
If the heroes don't notice them, the goblins lie in wait for them in a hollow way and flank the cart three on the left and three on the right, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two possible solutions
1. the heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village sheriff, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. if a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 is?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll definitely take many of your ideas to heart, and I have more confidence in my narratives now too.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race the broadcast was interrupted to let the F1 pre-reporting start on time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident meant that the schedule was way behind schedule, they still could have shown the last (scheduled) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again ignorance of the rules by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that it is allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this subject.
On Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility existed for Verstappen.
In my opinion, you should simply know such elementary rules if you commentate on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It's also not the first guessing game as to what is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both just have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them seem simply unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings totally a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he obviously doesn't take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the practice sessions than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
While you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone doesn't let me overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repeats.
All in all, Sky really is the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a decent broadcaster.

The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outlet or similar...and you are ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be placed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent, if once water would run backwards, that the water from the basin runs through the pump....
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first U.S. man in space, a TV host and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, clad in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a Nasa astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were the company's guests of honor; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
She said he had to work hard on his missions and do everything himself.
She was just along for the ride, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back into space right now, the presenter said.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again braked by large parachutes.
The International Aeronautical Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth to be the limit for space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space excursion: on the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Or because people seriously want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.

GDR handmade model old building electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of Modelleisenbahner ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One of the locomotives is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished for operation.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be capable of hauling 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this line.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager propulsion AEG was to supply the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the road numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and subsequently found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
At the Reichsbahn repair facility in Dessau, it was determined that all six locomotives were worthy of refurbishment.
[4] When an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight service arose as the re-electrification of the Central German network progressed, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reconditioned in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were given priority.
It was only when it became clear that the number of E 94s could not be increased any further that the E 95s became the focus of refurbishment.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They were transferred to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were used in a separate rotation schedule mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control system of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
It often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
In such cases, the stevedore, who was always riding on the locomotive, had to use a hammer and a wooden wedge to loosen the contactors again while the locomotive was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of locomotive downtime.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and with most of the splitter classes, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted electric locomotives to be manned only by one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn from service in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive's exterior began to be refurbished with the goal of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is now in the care of the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Arnstadt Museum-Bw with a new interior and exterior paint scheme, with the transformers having been checked and five traction motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in service until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved their worth due to their reliable propulsion and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the locomotives were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.

To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status until now.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the corona virus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he said, he has refused because the communication should not be about himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind, he said, "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid 19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote further.
He did not ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, he said, so sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
He added that there was prioritization in Germany when it came to vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own information.

Infertility treatment with PKV / What is an "insured event"?
Hello everyone,
we were some time in fertility treatment, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
First things first:
We had applied for the infertility treatment in advance with the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and performed 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill PKV for them.
We again applied to PKV for coverage and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we performed more attempts than promised, logically settle the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second attempt is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insured event begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have informed us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insured event?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!

"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost to the EU
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
In the long term, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments, he said.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposing this, this is happening at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, he said, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail when a member state gets it into its head to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
Moreover, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said, adding that a fundamental agreement on asylum policy is becoming more difficult because the "border protection, border protection, border protection" line has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guards, migrants have again attempted to cross into Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained Sunday night and taken back to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said Sunday.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza, she said.
According to reports, one soldier was hit in the face and had to receive medical treatment from a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to stop departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response has been pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"That's where the EU has brought its market power to bear and shown its determination to operate with hardball and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs, he said.

In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank Group division - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight deposit accounts.

Film search help please
Hello Dear All,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
One is the modern age (real world).
On the other hand the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and a plot develops.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
The passage is also the tomb of the soldier, I think.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If this means something to you I am grateful for any answer.

No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity swallow even larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need for everyday use remains well organized and separable from the photo gear thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
Here, the closure flap houses a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thereby considered different "filling levels": there are namely 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: when you're carrying not only your photo gear, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side to access camera gear in the right main compartment, for example, while everyday items stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you're headed to Scotland in the fall.

Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
Tuned discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the disc cooling, while the gates improve the cleaning of the brake discs and pads.
Aesthetic features of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car by attractive and eye-catching appearance.

Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered luminous chunks in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked what became known as the "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous towns in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was Coloma or Bust!
In this game, you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and making a name for yourself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You'll also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent territories.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You'll have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can use fine adjustments to develop your individual play style.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the map where they can take actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the matching locations.
When a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, pitching tents, fording rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The praiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each turn, changing the actions available.
This continues until the bragger has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a gunfight in which players must defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, at which point the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good, because my dear head is thinking up everything that can be thought up.
Before I get carried away here ... in short: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing my Ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I mention nothing more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that might be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with the teaching profession and was sure that this is it - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'll google other job postings."
And it's only been six months.
The times before that I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can always change my mind.
But right now I am absolutely done.
I had the last month so little free time that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacations, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my end of the day was my end of the day.
That's when I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is going well, in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it's not already doing that.
I ask myself whether I want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your posts here - or whether I shouldn't go back to my old job, where I was valued, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work kind of boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back in the same place in a year's time and be dissatisfied.
You realize, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas on how I get out of this situation, that I am completely finished and virtually at the slightest thought of it begin to cry.
I won't make any decisions right now so emotionally, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.

Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, resulting in, among other things, the combination of advanced modeling technology with "Valve Reactor" circuitry that perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amps are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amp better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a sealed enclosure and bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
VOX's "Tone Room" software even lets you correct and bend historical facts on the virtual plane until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Since then, of course, it has been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, resulting in another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to satisfy all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the punch and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power amp that determines the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances and sonic character of a tube amplifier.

Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data are available on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists continued to dare not predict when it might end.
Indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Millions in damage
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new spits of land with a combined size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
The most severely affected sector was banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.

Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
There is something seductive about the many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and crackling excitement.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peacemaking "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked Christmas with gift-giving.
Before that, gifts were given to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as the Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots of children in particular with gifts.
Protestants took offense at this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "worship of saints."
For these reasons, they opposed the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such matters of detail so narrowly, it upsets only a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the custom of St. Martin with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's parade.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots outside the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christianized countries, there is a merry huddle over who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white ruffled beard, which has little in common with the rather severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Magi give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

In Hollywood spectacles, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully inside.
Smart Stone", on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in no less than six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither power supply nor batteries.
Place the "light stone" in any place that receives sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes provide a firm hold if needed.
The matte white plastic cover itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
"Smart Stone" discreetly hides its solar panel inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.

As dusk falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow automatically; you decide for yourself in which color: There are no less than six attractive light colors to choose from - in addition to daylight white.
The light is also switched off automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predefined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I am currently still having a lot of problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as media.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free at school (which sucks for geography).
I currently just take a long time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every lesson actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the assignments in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe some geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time efficient way.

Retailers fear for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered may enter most stores.
Retailers think this is unnecessary and complain about a drop in sales.
They also have a possible solution.
In the view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized that sales of non-daily consumer goods were plummeting.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers conducted by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business, he said.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," Genth said.
Accordingly, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retailing and in the online sector, he added.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G when shopping does not bring us forward in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deter customers and require high staffing levels, he said.
The ribbon scheme must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the wristband received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in the retail sector - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, the real estate group specializing in shopping centers, also spoke of difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent.
These figures are now sure to fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, the company is trying to find solutions for the centers and get them approved.
These include the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof once at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel - can enter all stores without being disturbed." dpa

After the release of our new high end full range driver B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also have offspring.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal is a suitably designed foot directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Based on the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level should be achieved in terms of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it performs remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 has been tuned with a slight treble rise.
This is common with full-range speakers to optimize the bundling that increases strongly to high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outward, the high frequency range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM, which are worthy of reference, ensure fine dynamics that are second to none.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolving power and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning to plan appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the cabinet, the countersink of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer will add more material.
After all the panels have been cut (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point, so that you can later feed the cable through there without any problems.
With the help of a router, the speaker opening now follows in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be inserted flush.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the bevel, as shown in the picture "Detail bevel".
Then you start the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side panels on a flat surface in front of you.
Now glue the back panel, the lid, the front and the bottom onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued in the process.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, e.g. if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to attach the second side.
This is followed by all the panels of the base, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear panel is facilitated.
Then use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with it.
The base plate is then glued firmly to the base of the cabinet and also screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) the screw connection points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the cabinet has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear panel.
To do this, push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base up to the terminal opening and let it stick out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the cabinet the cable is led to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in place, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely sealed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue on the opening and seal it that way.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed tight with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut in two and loosely distributed in the cabinet.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
