In my opinion, the literature program was created by Balzac-aged ladies based on their interests.
From 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belle-lettres, of course, from the point of view of those same Balzac-aged ladies.
But the psychology and agonies of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not that interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of characters.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige Mattress 105х195.
The Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The two sides of the mattress have different firmness: the medium firm surface is made from coconut fiber and natural latex, and the moderately soft one is from a natural latex slab.
The spring unit with 1,000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Another advantage of this model is its breathable materials.
The latex perforated for air permeability is naturally well-ventilated, as is the coconut coir.
This ensures a healthy micro-climate for the sleeping area.
There is also an extended warranty for this mattress.
The official warranty from the manufacturer is valid for 5 years, but the mattress will actually last longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is delegated to the removable Jacquard cover that comes with the package.
You can buy an orthopedic pillow to complement the mattress, which is recommended to keep your spine in the optimal position during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of each side — coconut anatomically supports the back and latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn your brain on and kick that sort of relative out!
Better to have none than this...

I recall the feasts and guests in my parents' house with terror.
Guests are at the doorstep, but the cutlets are still being finished roasting, and my bedraggled mother is cleaning the floor.
Good God, he was already exhausted by the time he sat down at the table.
And then you have to do the dishes and tidy up the house.
For a week before the holiday you are hauling groceries about; two days of cooking and a day of cleaning after.
And as for the guests?
It is all great for them, and the cake is brought along as well.
Since then I have disliked holidays and guests.
Even for my own family I lay the table with minimal effort.
But I make them tasty snacks; I bake very often just like that.
Germany: a fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, in the fall at the latest," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, the increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the Omicron new coronavirus strain.
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, reinfection with Omicron is three times more likely than with the Delta or Beta strains.
Evidence of this comes from the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, the manufacturers BioNTech/Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omicron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of coronavirus Omicron.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness is significantly lower with two doses of the vaccine: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"It indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating rate of the vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows it very convincingly," emphasized the expert.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21® company.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally designed to be used in both ice and cast fishing.
These vibs have a higher specific weight than their close-in-size analogues, which certainly has a positive effect on the application nuances of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper finlet made of strong and resilient plastic, which creates additional degrees of vibration during vertical and horizontal retrieval.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite an aggressive game as a "winter vib" in plumb fishing.
A simple monotonous animation is often the best for fishing, which means moving the rod up and down almost without any pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with submerged aquatic vegetation, snags and other obstacles you can get caught on.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for zander or large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when you need a point and aggressive bait feeding.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the initial vertical.
Also, Bet-A-Vib is equally successful when used during winter fishing for pond trout.
To please it, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS — NanoSound) or without it (SL — Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib play plumb can annoy a passive pike that does not react even to live bait.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy during cast fishing.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fish line and braided cords even of large diameters.
When fishing for pike, zander, ruffle or perch, in addition to flat, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with scratching on the bottom.
If you are fishing in a muddy area, you can change the front treble to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snagging.
Bet-A-Vib is one of the most stable to use and, as a result, one of the best for fishing among the baits of its class.
It can be used with equal success in both relatively shallow and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
So many young idlers sit on old parents' necks.
The "golden youth" are, for the most part, a lot of dyed-in-the-wool layabouts who know nothing and are good for nothing.
Abundant life leads to idleness.
Possibly Mishustin meant this quite significant part of the population.
Surely you are joking.

Libya claims 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) Wagner.
This was announced by Khaled al-Mishri, chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, on Sunday, December 12.
"Currently, there are more than 7 thousand PMC Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They have airplanes, too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," according to the Anadolu Agency quoting his words.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication's informant, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and a port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, notes the agency's publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries — CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," says the article.
According to the media, the Wagnerians allegedly fought in the Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the personnel lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
To recap, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries earlier approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating in it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single voting day for the election of parliamentary deputies and the head of the state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," notes the article.
Against this background, the High Election Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, reports Sky News Arabia TV channel.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes — "we defended, restored the peace in Syria", "the decision on Nord Stream 2", "the whole world is intimidated by our cool weapons", "we took over Crimea".
The main failures are "the conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world," says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Government of Dubai has completely turned away from paperwork — all government services have also become exclusively digital
The Government of Dubai has announced a complete phase-out of paperwork and a transition to digital technologies.
All government services to the population will also be provided only in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirates News Agency WAM.
"This day marked the beginning of a new digitalization stage for all aspects of Dubai's life — we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now internal and external document flow will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms in all the government institutions of Dubai.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and public utilities, police, municipal bodies, the courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to electronic government and digitalization of document flow in Dubai started in 2018.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million man-hours and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said earlier that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Well, Dana, concerning the birth dates and the age of the child, it is stupid in itself; it is the same with the class and the group in kindergarten.
But I do not think there are many such ditz.
And if there are, they clearly do not give a damn about anything, including the family.
My mom lived with her two brothers and grandfather and grandmother at 3 Vladimirskaya, on the 1 floor without bars.
They first knocked on the door, then the window, then they decided not to beat around the bush, they broke the window and climbed in, but grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people definitely knew that someone was at home...
Automotive manufacturing and exports in Turkey dropped below the 2020 level
The manufacture and export of Turkish-made vehicles drastically fell in November in view of the Turkish lira's devaluation.
As a result, the industry's performance based on results for 11 months was even lower than last year's result, according to Bloomberg with reference to the Turkey Automotive Industry Association.
According to the Association, the output of Turkish automotive manufacturers in November amounted to 115 thousand vehicles, which is 20% lower than for the previous year.
Exports amounted to almost 75.9 thousand vehicles, which is more than 25% lower than for the previous year.
And, if based on the results of the first 10 months of the current year, the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated a positive year-on-year trend, the results for 11 months of 2021 show that the automobile output was 0.3% lower than last year's figure.
Such a decline is associated with the drastic devaluation of the Turkish lira exchange rate, which dropped by 29% against the US dollar in November.
This has led to economic slowdown in all industries.
More than 500 SMBs receive a loan extension in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov discussed the situation around the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports Kazinform's correspondent.
"According to the information from the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, in pursuance of the instruction by the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, Order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 'On Approval of the Procedure for Granting Loan Extensions to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses' was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to a deputy's request.
He recalled that in accordance with the procedure for granting loan extensions, banks and organizations involved in microfinance activities were to grant extensions on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMBs, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The extension period ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the SMB's choice.
The borrower's application could also indicate a different extension period.
During the extension period, the borrower enjoyed the suspension of any claim-related work, arrears notices and the collection of fees and other payments by the lender," said the Deputy Prime Minister.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for loan extensions from 603 SMB borrowers, 553 of which were granted extensions amounting to 9.7 billion tenge.
MFOs received extension applications from 131 SMBs, 95 of which were granted extensions amounting to 105.8 million tenge," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonary specialist Puryasev suggested that people with low immunity can have a mild form of Omicron
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system can have a milder form of the disease than people with strong defensive mechanisms in the body
Pulmonary specialist Sergey Puryasev explained why the Omicron coronavirus strain may prove to be less dangerous.
The reason can be found in the origin of the virus.
Scientists assume that Omicron originated in the body of an HIV-positive person or a person with immune deficiency disorder.
So, while mutating, the virus did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Therefore, it is more aggressive.
As the immune system did not respond, it spread extremely fast.
"It seems to have more spike proteins than it should, and its antibodies remained at the same level during mutation," comments pulmonary specialist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may have a milder form of Omicron than people with strong defensive mechanisms in the body.
It turns out that a strong immune response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
It happens in the case of pneumococcal disease, when young 30-year-old people die and 60-year-old people recover like from a common cold.
"Young people have a strong immune response, it's crazy: where it could just have shaken its finger, it takes a musket to kill a butterfly," concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous adverse effects, the most unpleasant of which is pneumonia.
Pulmonary inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
While the first type can be treated quickly and successfully, in the second case, you can only reverse symptoms — all hopes rest with the body.
The first symptoms of pneumonia are the onset of body intoxication: high temperature, weakness, feeling unwell.
Then respiratory symptoms appear: respiratory distress, throat irritation, cough.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain may also indicate that the disease is developing.
Meanwhile in Russia, the growing generation aged 12–18 may be subject to vaccination by the end of the year.
Virologist, Head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov noted that this category suffers severely from COVID.
Teenagers attending school have the maximum number of contacts.
"It is the most socially active group, just like pre-school children," Pavel Volchkov, Virologist, Head of Genome Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology stated in his interview with the Moscow 24 channel.

Immunologists suggested a hypothesis why obese people fall victims of COVID
The report's authors have examined the fat tissue left from bariatric surgery and discovered that fat cells, also known as adipocytes, could get infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fat tissue, macrophages, were also infected while showing a severe inflammatory response.
The scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID, and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding different organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses could lurk in the fat tissue and use it as a container in order to avoid the immune system response.
SARS-CoV-2 can probably act the same way.
The biologist announced reasons for the development of dementia
In his interview with Sputnik radio station, Semyon Golosheykin, Ph.D in Biology, named the reasons for the development of dementia and talked about ways to prevent it.
According to WНO data, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as the systematic loss of cognitive function — as time passes, the person orientates himself with difficulty, even in familiar environments.
Golosheykin pointed out that the most frequent reasons for dementia are neurodegenerative diseases, head traumas, some infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.
Certain factors increase the risk of disease development.
Hypertonia, diabetes, high concentration of cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism are among them.
"On a behavioral level, social isolation and the absence of active cognitive performance may also play a role," he said.
Addictions like smoking, excessive drinking, sleep disorders and an inactive lifestyle also cause the development of dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduced levels of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be either an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors of its appearance," the biologist added.
To prevent the disease, WНO recommends maintaining the proper level of physical activity, practicing cognitive skills and abilities that require involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the chair professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of FGAOU VO RNIMU to them.
N. I. Pirogov, Head of the Department of Cognitive Deterioration of the Federal Center for the Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, talked about the reasons behind memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on air on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the general inspector in the repatriation antiques department of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiques of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of the ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all the smuggled artifacts are recorded in the archives.
Department employees are now working on returning them to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that, upon their return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities contacted Interpol with a request to help find Pharaoh Tutankhamun's bust sold at auction in London.
Christie's Auction House held an auction on July 4, where a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
Tutankhamun's head, depicted as the son god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
It is not known how the relic got to Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of the archaeological research of "tomb raiders".
"Not counting the Crimean Tatars" — and that is right, as the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are a separate nation (related to the Turks).
If you want to add, then it is only 42 thousand people — that is how many (Kazan) Tatars live in Crimea (per the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation is made up of two words!
The Turkic language family is the only thing they have in common.
FT: Credit Suisse to obtain access to the personal mobile devices of its employees
Credit Suisse demands that its employees provide access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The issue is that the Swiss bank does not provide corporate communication devices to its employees in Europe and the USA, and offers a discount to buy a mobile phone or a smartphone from its partner telecom operator instead.
According to the applicable rules, the bank is able to view information on corporate devices provided to its employees, as these are used to contact colleagues and clients for business issues.
The bank takes advantage of its right to check mobile devices in emergencies, for example, if an employee uses the device to have a meeting with a client that has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, when most employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to expand the scope of this rule to cover all devices used for business purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management established a deadline for employees to familiarize themselves with the new rules.
Credit Suisse did not provide any official comment on the new regulations.

Part 4
Sergei Yesenin's last year of life — 1925 — was fruitful in terms of creative work, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his ego.
He is already beyond any literary associations, he broke with imagism, he is all by himself, but famous, popular, sometimes much scolded by critics, even wickedly, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
Over 60 poems were written throughout the year, many of them are real masterpieces; the cycle "Persian Motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, "Soviet Russia" collection.
And the main success — in late June in the 25th year, Gosizdat entered into an agreement with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
None of Sergei Aleksandrovich's poet contemporaries was honored in this way; he is the first!
In addition, this promised very good money — under the agreement, remuneration was 1,000 rubles a month for 20 months (a factory manager, for example, earned 300 rubles a month, an engineer — 200).
Money was needed that year as never before.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophia Tolstaya, it was needed to set up the family home, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life was seemingly getting better, there are reasons to rejoice, but for him everything is painted primarily in gloomy tones, as if the nightmare from "The Black Man" poem (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) was materialized:
My friend, my friend,
How sick I am.
Nor do I know whence came this sickness.
Either the wind whistles
Over the desolate unpeopled field,
Or as September strips a copse,
Alcohol strips my brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had a significant breakdown, looks bad, is clearly ill.
Drinking bouts and nervous breakdowns happen more often.
And the reason, presumably, is not only alcoholism...
However, if somebody gave Sergei Aleksandrovich such a diagnosis as alcoholism, there are no original documents left.
Let's say, those referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in Professor Pyotr Gannushkin's clinic near Paris (Yesenin will go to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
At the same time, there is more than enough evidence of the poet's drinking sprees, related scandals, police arrests scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the terrible love affair between the poet and the green serpent evolved rapidly.
In the late summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed at his friend's, imagist Ivan Startsev, for a short time.
It is amazing, but Yesenin, with his quite good income, never had his own home in Moscow or Peter; he stayed in rented apartments, hotels or with acquaintances.
Startsev recalls:
"He came just to stay overnight, and, in most cases, he was a mess, drunk.
Once, returning at 4 am, Yesenin fell down the stairs...
Falling down, he scratched his face and he was wheezing.
Coming to his senses a bit, he started coughing endlessly, spitting blood all over the bedsheet..."
Yesenin, after a trip across Europe and the USA (prohibition was in place in the States then, but Duncan took lots of alcohol with her), confessed:
"I saw nothing there, except taverns and streets...
I even stopped recognizing people in the end...
And, he was drinking, of course...
I was drinking because I was tormented by sorrow".

Son is now almost 16, and has long since lost his burning desire to act the fool.
All the energy is directed to the choice of what he is going to do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age, or my husband who had periodic problems with the law right up until the time of the wedding.
Father is taking care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl break down in tears at the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it is not a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon"
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used the refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to repeat such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs made the corresponding statement in his interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus "stopped Lukashenko" for a while; however, he is "actively searching for new ways."
The Polish minister is also certain that illegal migrants will now be used as a weapon "throughout the world."
As kp.ru already reported, the European Union has introduced the fifth set of sanctions against Belarus.
It covered 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe declared its intent to expand the scope of restrictions against the Republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
As a countermeasure, Minsk introduced a food import embargo on a large range of goods from the countries that had decided earlier to impose sanctions on Belarus.

"The hat is not for Senka": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
Velvet jackets prevailed at the social events of 2021.
Perhaps, the first person to declare his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.
His example was then followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket that was inappropriate for the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize environmental award ceremony and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
Lionel Messi also tried out the trend a few weeks ago.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons wore the same.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to data from the service's analysts, obtained by Gazeta.Ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and slim fit, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets — they choose velvet suit sets less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
This season, velvet jackets are presented in the luxury segment of almost all brands — Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent.
The Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the "House of Gucci" movie premieres, is considered to be the most desirable.
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be confident that the velvet is made of silk.
It is a special weave technology that creates a dense fabric with a hairy outer texture and smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, consequently, do not last as long.
Lamoda Fashion Expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that when it comes to a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or design but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you are going to a party or a formal event, explains Vakhoshkin. It will also be appropriate for such situations when 'Black Tie' or 'Creative Black Tie' dress code is specified in your invitation."
Another important criterion, which when is met allows to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"First of all, a man in a velvet jacket should get into a right progressive well-off crowd, according to the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion Krasavchik Brammell. — The owners of velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to coinciding social events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with things that are just as elegant: classic pleated pants, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, tassel loafers, cufflinks.
Things that are too simple and casual will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from Krasavchik Brammell are convinced: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will be inappropriate, but if it is "one of the heads from those who run the event, then — yes, such a thing will be just for him."
If an employee is lower in rank, and his goal is to move up higher in the company's complex hierarchy or wheedle out financial bonuses, than it would be better not to put on a velvet jacket.
Management will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "the hat is not for Senka", according to the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
The tone is unnatural, it sounds so forced.
And it does not relate at all to the pretty face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the excitement of the other people.
But I wish success in life with all my heart!
It's all about money — alternative energy is well-lobbied, meaning it's paid for.
Billions in investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity increased.
Traditional energy is not losing either — gas, and oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they're being sold now.
The demand for fuel is crazy.
The kopeck is dripping.
So who's losing out?
As usual — the average consumer.
Do the problems of the Indians really bother the sheriff?
Therefore, you shouldn't treat western politicians as idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did what they had to.
For a good reward.
He did not see one single good-looking person in the photos from the article.
Just the sort of mediocrity within the statistical average for passengers.
Possibly if such characters are so confident in their good looks that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then it is likely that nobody is going to take the seats next to them.
But that is entirely because of the psychological imbalance and ignorance of these "beauties", and certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "the slave who is aware of his slavish condition and fights it is a revolutionary.
The slave who is not aware of his slavish condition and vegetates in silent, unenlightened and wordless slavery, is just a slave.
The slave who drools when smugly describing the delights of slavish existence and who goes into ecstasies over his good and kind master is a groveling boor".
An immunologist stated that revaccination in 4–5 months contributes to a response to Omicron coronavirus strain
Revaccination in four to five months can protect from the new Omicron coronavirus strain.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov who called the revaccination in six months, in terms of the emergence of the new strain, a "very long period."
"For previous strains, such a period was enough, but now the best way is to get revaccinated in five months, and for people with chronic diseases — in four months," said the expert and called for revaccination along with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination ensures good neutralizing antibody titers.
"If a person had two vaccinations and a booster vaccine, or if they went through the disease and got vaccinated, or vaccinated and went through the disease, they received 'hybrid immunity', i.e., lots of antibodies are present, and neutralizing antibodies are enough," specified the expert.
G7 warned Russia of "massive consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
Members of the G7 (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement after the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have massive consequences and a severe cost" for Moscow, but the document did not describe specific actions.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," statement says.
Furthermore, the ministers call on Russia "to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments on the transparency of military activities," recalling the words that U.S. President Biden said in a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support of France's and Germany's efforts in the Normandy Format on reaching full implementation of the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the Foreign Ministers of the G7 also declared.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.
They warned that "Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response."
We confirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the right of any sovereign state to define its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
"We will intensify cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier today, Elizabeth Truss, the head of British diplomacy, claimed that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her statement, this meeting has shown the "united voice of the G7 countries, that account for 50% of the world’s GDP and send a very clear message that the invasion of Ukraine would have massive consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of the antiviral activity of citizens who received two doses of the drug against COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way of protecting against the severe illness when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The study's authors concluded that the Omicron strain could trigger a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if no additional measures were taken.
Ukraine's Minister of Defense accuses Germany of blocking NATO arms shipments to Kyiv
Oleksii Reznikov, head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, has accused the government of the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of preventing Kyiv from buying deadly weapons from NATO.
In his interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of counter-sniper systems and rifles for striking drones.
There is also a mention that Berlin later softened its stance on the rifles, acknowledging them as non-deadly weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to make every effort to obtain the above-mentioned weapons as part of the bilateral agreements with its allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
However, as FT points out, the position of the new German government headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on permitting weapons supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect deliveries of weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership attributed its refusal to supply weapons to the risk of military escalation of the Donbas conflict, despite the fact that "Russia was occupying" part of Ukraine's territory.
The diplomat is convinced that Germany will hold the same "illogical" stance under the new chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Kyiv counts on Berlin's help to equip its navy.
They expect Germany to be "Ukraine's partner in the technical sphere," the president added.
It was also mentioned that spring this year marked the visit of Robert Habeck, the co-leader of Germany's "Green" Party, to the republic, where he advocated selling defensive weapons to Kyiv.

A three-room flat.
It was.
Of course the project, the permission and the new technical passport are all in accordance with the law.
In the entrance hall a bookshelf and a large wardrobe were built.

It is really tasty.
I also add a few onions and a green apple to it.
Give it a try.

Russia was not on the list.
There we go!

Mercedes registered a protest against Abu Dhabi Grand Prix results
The German Mercedes team, with driver Lewis Hamilton as runner-up at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after Red Bull racer Max Verstappen, has registered a protest against the final race result, reports the Formula 1 press service.
Mercedes believes that during the race, Formula 1 rules 48.12 and 48.8 were broken.
In the first case, the German team contests the decision of the stewards for the lapped racers to return to the same lap as the leaders.
In the second case — Verstappen overtook Hamilton before the permitted "restart" zone.
In addition, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result, where Verstappen beat Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula 1 World Championship, is provisional, and it is unknown when claims of Mercedes will be reviewed
G7 warns Russia of the consequences of invading Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned Russia of "serious consequences" in the event of continued military aggressions towards Ukraine, as indicated by the parties' final statement.
The meeting's participants also condemned Russia for increasing its military presence at the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have large-scale consequences and a serious cost," it says in the statement published on the United Kingdom government's website.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative said that they were "united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
At the press conference in Liverpool, the British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned that Russia will face "major consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce its aggression against Ukraine," she said (as quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the Liverpool summit, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by Russia's military build-up on the Ukrainian border, the parties must return to negotiations.
This referred to negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke in favor of the "Normandy format" dialog on Ukraine.
Maria Zakharova, representing Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that, by urging Russia and Ukraine to return to negotiations, the G7 countries "admitted their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways to return money stolen through online stores are revealed
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts during a conversation with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of big losses if the bank card details fall into the hands of fraudsters, it is recommended keeping the main funds on a card or a bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be set aside in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use the protective 3D Secure technology, you can initiate the refund procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions made without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility lies on the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," said the representative from Promsvyazbank.
Artur Zaremba, an expert at the international payment provider Ecommpay, emphasized that the buyer is entitled to apply to the bank to dispute a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores return funds to the customer themselves if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, member of the Public Chamber, head of the Safe Internet League, reported that 11 thousand appeals on different cases of fraud were received in 2021 alone: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU laws
The newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the Belarussian border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, Russia's troop buildup around Ukraine and the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline situation.
Although Scholz declared his aspiration for good long-term relations between Germany and Poland, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations from each other.
Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to act against Nord Stream 2, which is designed to transport Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's effort to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin announced its assistance to Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European court fined Poland, having established that the judicial reforms adopted by the right-wing Law and Justice party infringe EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its supreme court has ruled that national laws have priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the US, has not made any public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
American officials declared to members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about halting the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, reports a high-ranking US member of Congress on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these statements, but on Wednesday, Scholz warned of the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, watch more carefully.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and room, so you can partially see the second window.
And, in general, the people who have doubts don't know the original layout.
And I am very familiar with such apartments and can easily see how the layout was changed.
Let all be well with them.
I am always amazed when they write about substances for cleaning the sink, toilet, window sills, faucets.
Do you wash them once a year at Easter, so you have to scrub them so much.
Just don't let it get dirty.
MinTsifry intends to grant residences to writers
The Government will grant the federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers.
MinTsifry, which will establish the fund, informed the Parlamentskaya Gazeta that it will be used for writers' residences.
MinTsifry is preparing a draft Presidential Decree on establishing the fund to support Russian writers.
The explanatory note clarifies that the fund will be entrusted with taking care, among other things, of the intended use and preservation of buildings and structures that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Literary Fund.
"The Russian Federation has inherited a significant amount of real estate that used to belong to the Literary Fund of the USSR, including those located in Peredelkino writers' village in Komarovo village Leningrad Oblast, and others," the MinTsifry Press Office told the Parlamentskaya Gazeta.
According to the draft decree, the Fund's articles should state that the Fund "is being established for the purpose of facilitating literary activities by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
As MinTsifry explained to our publication, "'creating conditions for creative work' means the creation of residences for writers that would have comfortable conditions for creative work, based at transferred real estate in different regions of Russia."

Doctors warned about the danger of prolonged use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of the uncontrolled use of blood thinners after the COVID-19 coronavirus infection and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Irina Yartseva, general doctor and immunologist, said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can cause a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood thinners are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the in-patient facility, had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent the excessive formation of blood clots) if medically required.
She said that obscurantism is happening now — everyone takes anticoagulants for a long time and then gets complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (cerebral hemorrhage) with this background.
Sergey Tokarev, chief preventologist of the UFD, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medicine, told URA.RU in the course of a conversation that Russians now often use anticoagulants randomly even before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-medication.
There are citizens who decide to start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And doctors notice bruises during the preliminary examination before vaccination.
He pointed out that it is extremely dangerous to take any medicine without finding out the cause of any symptom.

A plumber who found money in a church wall will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in a church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the large Lakewood evangelical church where pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising wealth and prosperity for devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cauley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags with money and checks under the insulation.
He handed the find over to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Osteen.
"I wanted to hear him say: 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done,'" KPRC-TV quotes him saying.
Apparently, the find is connected with a theft that happened at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
About 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in checks, which were kept in the church safe, were stolen then.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cauley could not lay claim to this amount because the reward had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the reward and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will get 20 thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.
Tanya, her comments, her behavior — it is what characterizes her "as a real person".
That's why the attitude toward her is so negative.
And it isn't because "she is financially much richer than all scribblers", as they write here.
There are richer people, but they don't behave so rudely, so obnoxiously, as this madam.

"The situation is even more serious considering that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for holding New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, and other events, which implies an increase in the tourist flow," noted Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazil government obliged tourists who are not vaccinated against Covid to follow the five-day isolation period.
A scheme of complete protection against COVID-19 is revealed
Anatoly Altstein, virologist, doctor of medicine, honored scientist of Russia, in a conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against the coronavirus infection.
According to him, it can be achieved by injection and by using a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal use, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are produced. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies) are being produced.
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision on double vaccination yet," said the physician.
Sergei Tokarev, chief preventologist of the UFD, in turn, said that the main advantage of nasal vaccination combined with injection was the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help because in this case, the body's protection should probably reach its maximum.
Earlier, Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseinov, said that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new episode of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture seen in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I said this to my dog (he is long since dead) — if you are ready to exchange a warm house, food, kindness, love, and games for a bitch in heat, on you go.
But he was a well-trained doggie and quite smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of the cases.
It is not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I have held back many owners to stop them from running after a dog, though they lamented about 200 thousand fleeing (pomskies), taken directly by the hand and lead to the other side.
Eventually the "200 thousand" chose the owner and not the doggie that was running around somewhere out there.
Mass anti-vaccination protests continue in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets of the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the plans of the authorities to make the covid vaccination mandatory.
Starting from next February, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the health policies of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some people were holding signs saying "It is a false pandemic", "I will not get vaccinated".
A large protest against health passports was held in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightspots.
The decision to introduce health passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country following the increasing number of coronavirus infection cases.
More than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes in Luxembourg.
The protest started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with enforcers.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
Law enforcement officers responded by using water cannons.
Nikolai S., even Wikipedia doesn't have a unanimous opinion on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also named the "first Russian doctor, medical doctor", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think that they both deserve this title.
I only agree on one thing with Zakharova: the Americans only brought death and plunder to any country they appeared in.

WHO has found Omicron in six dozen states already
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus Omicron has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain can have disastrous consequences.
The WHO reported on the strain's spread rate.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the high spread rate of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts fear that, according to preliminary data, the new strain can beat the Delta strain spread rate, the same as the Indian coronavirus variant, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Previously, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that currently several hundred people officially have Omicron in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths caused by the Omicron strain, and more than 2 thousand people will be hospitalized every day at its peak.
The British healthcare system will not be able to handle this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to Omicron — this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Curious Belochka, you're right, talking online is completely different, chatting is easy and effortless, but when you meet in person, there's nothing to say.
Yes, and to see the man in person, maybe it's not what you expected, it didn't hook you — hence the attitude.
When you meet your man, then your opinions will change.
And once more, the Soviet period is being called "the time of demons".
Yes, people believed in God much more honestly then than today.
Yes, and they were brought up pretty much in accordance to God's laws (love your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today — money at any cost.
One has little faith (none at all, in fact) in chatterboxes such as Globa, but even if that's the case, the time of demons arrived in the 90s...
Our communal apartment from Bolshaya Zelenina in Petersburg, more precisely Leningrad, still keeps in touch.
Of course, we're not the closest friends, but we try to keep up the warm relations of the older generation.
Maybe it's because there were no strangers in the apartment, rooms weren't let out, and there was always the siege brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, quit it!
Human young, particularly those of male sex, are strong, active, energetic; they make mischief, shove, scuffle, and fight just like their young counterparts in the natural world!
It is just a shame they are not so soft as puppies or kittens, and so bruises, bumps, and scrapes are the usual state of affairs, and not any sort of boomerang!
What for?

Are you always so agile that you have never bumped into someone by accident and have never injured yourself?

$135 billion went into apps — Hi-Tech
In 2021, there has been a 25% increase in user spending on apps, and a 8% increase in the number of downloads.
The most popular ones globally were various video services.
The video editor CapCut had the largest number of downloads, while users spent the most money on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending showed significant growth from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significant was the growth in users' in-app spending, which increased by 25%, reaching a record-breaking 135 billion.
This data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented its report on the mobile app market in 2021.
In 2021, global economies emerged from lockdown into post-pandemic recovery.
"Would the 'return to physical' stall the growth of the app economy? Not at all," the report's authors believe.
The leader in terms of downloads was India, which had around 20% of all downloads.
It was followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Just as before, iOS users spent more than Android device users: iOS accounted for 65% of all in-app spending.
The most downloaded app of 2021 was the video editor CapCut.
It was followed by two Indian apps: the video service MX TakaTak and the online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the Top 10 in terms of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, users tend to favor VPN services (there are two of those in the Top 10 — VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services for creating and streaming videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the Top 10 includes two more services of this type — Moj and SnackVideo).
"Users spent the most money on video sharing and online streaming apps," the report's authors say.
YouTube is the leader here; the Top 5 for user spending also includes the video service TikTok, the streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The top spots in terms of monthly active users are held by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, with Microsoft Office's mobile version closing the Top 5.
In Russia, the year's leader in terms of downloads is the shopping app AliExpress.
It is followed by the Zenly service that detects your friends' locations, and once again CapCut.
The Top 10 apps also include: the online karaoke service StarMaker, the online clothing retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, the online cab booking service DiDi, a YouTube client called Pure Tuber, the Dixie retailer's app and the online store Samokat.
All around the world, people adapted to the pandemic by transferring their lives into the mobile space, which may be one of the key conclusions here.
The most successful industries were those that helped people get closer both virtually and in person," says Lexi Sydow, head of market research at App Annie, regarding the report's results.
The mobile games sector's revenue for 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games with no or almost no plot, and minimal visual work.
The Top 3 most popular games in the world were Count Masters, Project Makeover and Brigade Race.
In Russia, the most popular games were DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the key trends for next year, the company's analysts mentioned TikTok's user growth to 1.5 billion, the increased popularity of financial apps, such as the Robinhood investor app, with Generation Z, and the continued growth in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians were warned about a new fraud scheme
Attackers started looking for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, product director at the company Ivideon, deepfakes are the main danger associated with the spread of video communications.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the victim.
In this way, the neural network manages to accurately reproduce the patterns of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that, by using a deepfake, attackers could call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of the person to send out for blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, because a skilled attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
Alexander Vetkol, leading system engineer at Varonis, in turn, noted that, psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies that use video.
David, I am going to add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local attitude did not allow heavy use of make-up or to wear short skirts, to show legs in stockings or tights.
It is a province, but there WAS such an item in the shop.
Muslim women also used make-up and showed thighs in big cities.
It is that way in Dushanbe as well; that is a big city, the capital of the republic.
Many fashionable ladies, but no such cosmetics.
Five actions that will help to avoid diabetes mellitus are specified
Problems with blood sugar levels are one of the most common in the world.
However, some people make little of it, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing formation of the disease.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking schedule — reducing the number of different drinks and switching to regular water have a positive effect on the metabolism.
Sweet food raises blood sugar levels to a dangerous rate when consumed in excessive amounts.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The disease does not only appear because of an unhealthy diet but also of habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus, you need to move a lot.
Specialists advise sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight but also protect from sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
You need to eat a lot of fiber to protect against diabetes.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thereby contributes to a sense of fullness, the release of digestive juices and increased digestion.

Doctor Pavlova told about "weekend migraine" among workaholics
Several factors may cause discomfort during weekends
The reason for feeling unwell at the end of the working week frequently lies in the "weekend migraine", the renowned Endocrinologist, PhD in Medicine, Senior Research Associate of the Fundamental Medicine Department of Moscow State University, Academic Advisor of Systems Medicine Clinic, Zukhra Pavlova told on her Telegram channel.
According to her, it is most widespread among workaholics who suffer from headache, fatigue and weakness in the weekends.
Doctor Pavlova noted that apart from fatigue accumulated during weekdays, there are many intrinsic reasons for the body's negative response to changing circumstances.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep longer, spend the entire day on the sofa, most likely, eat more and drink less water," the doctor argues. "Due to a lack of caffeine, we suffer mild withdrawal symptoms.
Overnutrition and dehydration cause distress and fatigue."
Getting up late is another factor.
So, if you wake up three hours later than usual, you can experience the so-called jetlag.
It is experienced by travelers who change several time zones.
In order to determine which factor plays the key role in discomfort, Pavlova recommended tracking major changes during weekends.

South African scientists declared low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against Omicron
RSA declared low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against Omicron
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa made a study and reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron coronavirus strain.
"According to estimates, it (the Omicron neutralization level) corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness (level) of 22.5% against the infection with symptoms; therefore, … the ability of the vaccine to provide immunity against the infection is doubtful," according to the study report published on MedRxiv.
Meanwhile, the specialists noted that the vaccine may prevent severe disease.
The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine earlier forecast that the Omicron coronavirus strain may cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalization than last year.
How much hidden sugar is there in usual food products?
Sugar is not the best source of healthy nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type two diabetes and also cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that hidden sugar may be indicated by an unfamiliar word in the product's composition — an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may indicate several dozen names, which in fact mean sugar.
Some of the most common and widespread names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), laevulose (fruit sugar), molasses (molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed food, and also to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar vary in taste, but no matter the name of the ingredient in product contents — syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white — it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, because you need to consider not only the amount of sugar indicated on the package by the manufacturer but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc., initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Therefore, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose its importance for Germany in 25 years
Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"So that in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Sholz noted that Germany remains committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is essential for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the USA put out a statement recording Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and coalition treaty discussion, it was stated that the European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline does not yet "comply with the regulations" of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!
I used to visit these parts in the year 1985.

Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account hacked
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Twitter account was compromised by hackers.
The violators were able post a fake message.
According to this message, India supposedly acknowledged Bitcoin as legal means of payment, and has already bought cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked that the new messages be ignored.
The Prime Minister's representatives said that Twitter reacted quickly, restoring access to the account.
The Indian Prime Minister's account had been hacked before back in 2020, with calls for donations to a fund in cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
The third referendum in New Caledonia that took place on December 12 ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial result declared at noon on Sunday, December 12, the majority of the population of New Caledonia voted against their territory's independence at the referendum.
At the same time, participation rates during the third voting were much lower than in two previous ones.
According to early results published by the local government, 3.51% (2,755 people) of voters voted for independence, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
Voter turnout was 43.90%, more than 80 thousand New Caledonia citizens took part in the voting in total.
As France-Presse agency commented on these early results, the "outcome of the voting left no room for doubt", because independence supporters called on electors not to participate in voting.
While being the initiators of the referendum, they came out against holding it on December 12, considering that the new epidemic COVID-19 outbreak on the archipelago would hinder the implementation of a full and "honest" election campaign.
Therefore, this non-participation led to the third victory of the French New Caledonia supporters, after the referendums that took place in November 2018 and October 2020.
56.7% of citizens voted against independence in 2018 and 53.3% in 2020.
Separatists stated that they reject the results of the last voting and will appeal against it to the UN.
As reported at the Elysee Palace on Sunday, December 12, Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, should speak about the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence significantly revived the last weeks of France's presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates stated that the territory should remain part of France because it is "the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia should certainly remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated several times.
Valerie Pecresse, the Republican candidate, also supported this claim by publishing a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, where she urged Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he will not take a stance "because it is not his responsibility."
At the same time, the President added: "France would not be as beautiful without New Caledonia".
In return, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced the "strong aspiration that the choice of Caledonians would become the choice of France".
Sveta, hey, hi!
I was a bit... rather rude to you, I'm still embarrassed, ashamed.
Thanks for not turning your back on my channel.
On the topic: I'm not an artist, I love drawing, but I end up with an inspirational scrawl.
But as an artist to not an artist in the slightest: what would you change here?
Just don't forget that the food was NATURAL, therefore obesity was not as common as now.
But medicine was terrible — leeches, garlic and broths.
Now they'd have you back on your feet right away.
And it has nothing to do with food at all.
Turkey has tested the world's first unmanned aerial vehicle with laser weapons
Turkey has successfully tested the world's first drone with laser weapons.
The Eren UAV was tested at distance of 100 to 500 m, reports MIR24.
The vehicle can neutralize explosive objects with a laser at a distance.
The maximum flight altitude of the innovation reaches 3 thousand m.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV should enter service with the Turkish Army, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without calling upon sappers.
The agency points out that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Salt, sugar, black peppercorns and sweet peas.
Sometimes a clove was added, it does not interfere.

Well, that is all.
Why should I want salmon; you cannot know what it is with this amount of money; pink salmon is a fine fish.
Bread, dairy butter, salmon.
An awesome sandwich.
WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the USA
WSJ readers criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, where he described his vision of Russian and US relations.
The author of the publication expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces the readers of the danger coming from Moscow and gave a number of insulting remarks about the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on western countries "to present a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the American professor's position.
"The article contains quite a bit of misleading information," RIA Novosti quotes one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to 'lose', and Ukraine is not our land.
"Neither the USA nor NATO allies would ever engage in a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another one commented.
The patches can also be used in the lip area.
The hydrogel used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patches is a high-tech polymer that ensures increased absorption and the transfer of highly concentrated natural plant essence to the skin, adjoins the skin tightly and brings a sense of freshness.
When transferring nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the collateral loss of moisture and makes the essence penetrate deep into the skin's layers.

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck in the area of the Kuril Islands
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
The earthquake's epicenter is reported to be 231.8 km to the north-east of the town of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus occurred at a depth of 92.5 km.
Seismologists previously recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing next-generation jet drones
ANKA-type jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) will be produced at a new Ukrainian-Turkish plant.
This was announced on December 11 by Oleksiy Arestovych, external adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office.
It means that they are capable of acting against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest is Turkish avionics: the frame and the like," as he is quoted by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA vehicles, Arestovych said that it is about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is the next generation of drones after Bayraktar, which are better than the last "in all specifics".
Arestovych concluded that the plant should produce the first batch of UAVs by the end of next year.
The ANKA aerial vehicle was created by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
Turkey's authorities had been developing it in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
A day earlier, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the joint forces' military operations in Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the country had begun the construction of a plant to build modern unmanned military aerial vehicles.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukraine's Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in Kyiv Oblast where they would train personnel and test and maintain Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The Ukrainian leader's press office called this memorandum "a real big step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at Singapore Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from it because of the nearby protective net.
The confrontation ended when employees from Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all the zoos in Singapore, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to deliver them to a quarantine institution.
It was reported earlier that in Phnom Pehn, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and walked the city's streets.
The animal voluntarily returned home the same day, people were not hurt.
Specialists warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to specialists, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to get certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, on the contrary, exceeding the required dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Nutritionist Ben Kitchin, Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, advises monitoring the amount of folic acid you consume throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this number upward or downward.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk or other food that contains folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
As it, among other things, is contained in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
About 75 thousand people could die in Great Britain by April because of the omicron strain
British scientists predict that up to 75 thousand people could die in England in the next five months because of the spread of the omicron coronavirus strain if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic prediction of the specialists, who are members of the scientific advisory group for emergencies under the British cabinet, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded by April 2022, and about 175 thousand patients in total will be hospitalized.
In addition, hospitals will take more than 2 thousand infected people daily at the peak of morbidity.
"Serious coronavirus control measures may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overloading if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines cannot exclude infections," said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency stated: if the spread rate of the omicron strain remains at its current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
In this event, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom by mid-December.
As of today, there are 1898 detected cases of infection with the Omicron coronavirus strain in Great Britain, 633 of which were detected in the last twenty-four hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid stated that in reality this figure may already reach 10 thousand cases.
I wanted to write a witty comment, but I have read up to this spot:

Worldwide demand for superyachts has increased by a quarter
Superyacht construction this year and orders for the next year hit all-time records around the world despite appeals to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.
According to the International Ship Registry, the number of yacht orders amounts to 1,200 vessels — a quarter more than in the previous year.
According to the "Guardian", in an era of combating the effects of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the means and appetite to build a floating fortress that costs 50 million dollars pounds or more will not fall.
However, their numbers are growing.
This year, the number of vessels ordered is 25% higher than in the previous one.
Brokers say that there has not been such a commotion on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are afraid to be infected onshore and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
While all these people used to go to the office and meet their business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working remotely and meeting via Zoom.
The broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are ready to pay more so they can get their yachts at least one or two years earlier.
"People just yearn for freedom and the super-rich people can afford it," he says.
Many people in western society criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that wealthy people are not willing to understand that space travel, life on a yacht and private jet flights during times of distress stir up society, because the elites do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call governments to action and propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, however they understand that this will be extremely hard to implement given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their specifications.
The sterns of 27 out of 1,200 vessels are more than 100 meters in length.
Norwegian billionaire Rokke is building the 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.
After launch, she will become the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht features a "moon pool" and a submarine to explore the sea depths.
Helipads and open-air cinemas are common for existing superyachts, but some of them, like, for example, wrestler McGregor's yacht, feature a fighting ring. Richard Wilk, professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana University, says that the carbon footprint left by the super-rich is negligible compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
But it has a symbolic value considering that there are just over 2,000 multibillionaires in the world.
It is just another example of hyper-consumption by quite a small group of people.
Scientists discovered that the emission footprint left by billionaires is several thousand times bigger than the footprint left by an average inhabitant of the planet.
While a single person produces 5 tonnes of CO2 per year on average, the major contaminator of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
By the way, two-thirds of the emission footprint was produced by his 162.5-meter-long yacht Eclipse.
Even when the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and order them to bring the yacht from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean Sea, for example.
Superyacht owners get no sympathy from other people when they complain on YouTube, like Gina Rinehart, Australia's richest woman Australia who owns mines on the continent, that there is no space to moor their giant vessels.
Also, it is difficult to understand her pleas to build marinas for more than 50-meter vessels.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of colon cancer was determined
American scientists determined the weekly volume of alcoholic drinks that increases the risk of cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that consumption of four or more alcoholic drinks a week is linked with the increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the chance of disease development increases with the increasing amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, the risk of colon cancer is higher for moderately drinking men than women.
Scientists cannot specify the exact reason for such type of oncology, they are just pointing out that certain factors lead to a destructive process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not have the slightest idea how far four-legged pets have actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have carried out various experiments to find out for certain how the animals' intelligence is developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's; however, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in the Sciencealert publication.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they know nothing about politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to fool their masters.
Experts believe that members of some breeds show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistical data is not yet enough for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses — Labradors, for example.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and their ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is prepared to bargain between the USA and Russia
The USA and Russia will "bargain" on Ukraine joining NATO, according to the article of analyst Alexander Kochetkov for Glavred.
In his opinion, in the very near future Washington and Moscow are going to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States regarding Ukraine not joining the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the statement by the American leader Joe Biden that any country is entitled to "join any alliance."
If you receive a deliberately unacceptable offer, well, for example, to sell your relative into sexual slavery, you would not bargain, but just tell them to go to hell.
However, they are going to bargain about Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia is not going to invade Ukraine, but rather strives for dialogue with Kyiv.
"Preparations are discreet, fast and immediately turn into an aggressive strategy; you do not wait for the troops to be discovered and counter-force to be deployed," he noted.
China stimulates the railway transportation industry
Cutting-edge Chinese technologies attracted companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries to a Chinese international railway transport and equipment production expo held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan province, /Central China/ in 2021.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow for automatic troubleshooting of train faults, according to company representative Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos Railway, which began operating earlier this month, have now been equipped with technologies that guarantee improved rolling stock reliability and performance.
Over the past six months, China has considerably stepped up its exports of railway transport, and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed "China's speed".
In May this year, the first double-decker electric high-speed trains developed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd.
With a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour, the trains will run on railways in Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
A subway train developed by the company for Turkey began trial operations in November.
The train will run on a subway line linking downtown Istanbul to the city's airport.
This line will open next year.
It will be the fastest subway line in Turkey, with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"Chinese railway equipment manufacturing is one of the industries with the highest innovations and the strongest international innovative competitive edge," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
"The industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, independent research and development, China has built an advanced rail equipment manufacturing system, with complete supporting facilities and large-scale operations.
The country ranks first in railway electrification and operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways, according to Feng Yaoxiang.
Biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Semen Golosheykin, PhD in Biology, listed the early signs of dementia in his interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to him, the early signs of dementia may include forgetfulness and a range of moderate cognitive disorders, such as difficulty concentrating, planning and deterioration in abstract thinking.
Currently, there are ongoing debates that hearing loss may also serve both as an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of its risk factors, according to the specialist.
Golosheykin pointed out that dementia may be caused by neurodegenerative diseases, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and deficiency of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most frequent causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that currently, healthcare professionals are unaware of an effective dementia treatment.
Therefore, timely prevention is recommended.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active socializing help reduce the risk of dementia.
The WHO also recommends moderate physical activity and regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive engagement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations to take various dietary supplements; however, their effectiveness and suitability are still being discussed in the academic community," said Golosheykin.
"The World Health Organization recommends moderate physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive engagement of memory and logical thinking," said Golosheykin.
Earlier, a UK dementia research charity stated that the disease increasingly strikes people in their 40s.
Healthcare professionals listed early signs of Alzheimer's disease.
Problems with vision may be considered as the first warning sign due to which the patient develops difficulty in recognizing objects.
Specialists listed another sign of developing dementia — aphasia, or a condition where a person fails to find the right words to express what he wants to say.
A neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychoneurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the physicians' council established under the ombudsman of Georgia, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading to his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, mood changes," said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond standard limits and the ex-president should now be sent for special rehabilitation.
"We call it neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili started sabotaging the receipt of medical care after he was disciplined by corrections officers.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to quash his sentence and restore his former rights.

Protests against COVID passes in Spain
Spanish cities Barcelona and Valencia saw protests against mandatory certification for COVID-19 vaccination, reports Europa Press agency.
In Catalonia's capital, about 3 thousand people participated in the protests.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for any visits to bars, restaurants, gyms, retirement homes and nightlife establishments.
Many people came to the protests without masks.
Using messages on their posters, they blamed the state for its totalitarianism and demanded it respect people's choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment establishments and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared medical tyranny and called the vaccine an experiment.
In Spain, from the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 mln coronavirus cases were recorded, and more than 88 thousand patients died.
In Russia, restrictions for the non-vaccinated are to be introduced.
Draft laws on the unified QR-code system were introduced to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit public venues, cultural institutions, public catering and retail facilities upon presentation of a vaccination or disease recovery certificate, or a certificate of medical contraindication to the vaccination.
The same rules will be established for rail and air transportation.

Steep ascent: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help the country establish its own world-class resorts
China hopes that the Olympics will not only engage 300 million citizens in winter sports, which will allow it to generate the 1 trillion yuan set by the president Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped remote provinces.
The Thaiwoo Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located close to the venue for the Winter Olympics, is becoming ever more popular with the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure development, landscaping work is being performed in the region: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 are large enough to host international-level competitions.
Many Chinese regions with resort locations, including Zhangjiakou, experience problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting stay at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regular visitors.
However, this is still far away.
Game-planning consultant Justin Downes says that, since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
One of them is Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing.
Downes believes that, despite some substantial changes, it will take many more years to establish a ski culture here.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed, and need the infrastructure for recreation.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chongli, not far from the Winter Olympics locations.
He says that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Since the completion of a high-speed railway from Beijing to Chongli two years ago, the locals have enjoyed plenty of work.
More and more stores selling winter sports apparel and equipment are opening in the country.
Food service outlets with national dishes are opening on the slopes.
Now there is even a COVID-19 testing station on Thaiwoo.
China's plan is to grow a thriving winter sports industry, pushing its athletes to lead in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment to reach world-class levels.
According to the WHO, more than 500 million people worldwide could fall into extreme poverty due to the pandemic
More than 500 million people worldwide could crash into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic that slowed down the progress of universal health coverage for humanity, declared the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On the occasion of International Universal Health Coverage Day celebrated on December 12, the WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In these reports, they stated that the pandemic led to interruptions in healthcare services and caused extra stress within the healthcare systems.
In this regard, the scope of vaccination has been reduced and fatality rates related to tuberculosis and malaria have increased for the first time in 10 years.
The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes over 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they are forced to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people are virtually devoid of social support.

Reuters: Taiwan minister was cut off from the Summit for Democracy at the White House's request
The speech by the Taiwan Minister for Digital Technologies Audrey Tang during the panel discussion Summit for Democracy organized by the United States was transmitted without video mode, as the recording of the summit on YouTube shows.
With a reference to sources, Reuters states that the video was disabled at the White House's request.
According to their statement, the reason for this was a map where Taiwan was highlighted in a different color than China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tang was prepared by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries by their degree of safeguarding civil rights.
On the map, Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were in red as "closed".
When the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced with a screenshot noting that the opinions of the discussion participants "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by Taiwan's Minister might have been contrary to the "One China" policy that Washington adheres to.
An agency source stated that after the map was shown, the United States National Security Council contacted the Department of State accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy organized by Washington was held on December 9–10 and was attended by representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil groups and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During "Day Zero" of the Summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Novaya Gazeta Chief Editor Dmitry Muratov called on the establishment of an international fund through which corrupt money would be given to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit had an "anti-Russia and anti-China attitude."

Our country is creating close to no workplaces.
And those it does create are not particularly well-paid.

SKETCHES OF A RURAL MUSCOVITE.
Do not put it in one pile — bad people exist, you could have complaints about them with a specific reason...
but what does it have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund and all the rest?
Write that they are "scoundrels who never returned the money".
But how many children they have and when is none of your business as long as they are not going to hang those children around your neck.
Besides, what gives you the right to judge them if that is out of the question?
It's probably just in education...
Selected (by themselves) parents dictate their own rules, openly spitting on already existing ones.
And what if this affects other spheres of life, legal procedures, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
And what if Dad implements his parenting and educational technique?
It would be terrible and a very bad example for others.

The MFA described the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the USA
In an interview with Izvestia, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of cooperation had lead to sad conclusions, and the problems between two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospects for improved relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have gone with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the USA to enforce its approaches on Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect Washington's position to change.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, at a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow was ready to restore dialog with the USA.
A virologist warned about the hazard of COVID nasal spray vaccination outside hospitals
People vaccinated with the COVID-19 nasal vaccine may be allergic and need medical help, thus, the first nasal vaccination points should not be organized in airports and shopping malls.
TASS was informed of this by Sergei Netesov, virologist, RAS corresponding member, Head of the Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology Laboratory, Novosibirsk State University.
Organizing nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping malls is easier, but I would do this only in medical institutions at first.
The reason is the risk of allergic reactions, though minor, but it is desirable that the person sit by the doctor's office for a while afterwards.
Doctors have special allergy relief kits that are effective in just a minute or two, which is sometimes crucial," says Netesov.
According to the virologist, one could think about vaccination at shopping malls after experience of using the medicine is accumulated.
He has also highlighted that it is important for a nasal vaccine to contact the nasal cavity during use.
Here, there is a probability that the vaccine will not reach the target if the patient blows the nose if congested after spraying.

Alexander M., please remind me, what style was used for the marathon at the 2021 World Cup?

Here's a question — what is Klaebo doing on the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get on the ski track if he was behind before the turn at the gate?

Then the belt on the HPS broke.
Then we got stopped by the traffic cops.
The organized column was going, and their vehicle broke down.
Need to tow.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk; the driver is inexperienced.
And to him — what kind of a drunk are you?
Not tripping, not falling.

I think that he's stuck in the adverts, why would he be unhappy.

The United Kingdom recorded 1,239 daily cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant — RT in Russian
1,239 daily cases of coronavirus infections with the new Omicron variant were detected in the United Kingdom.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron variant were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with the new kind of infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of those infected with the new COVID-19 variant reached 3,137 people in the United Kingdom.
Previously, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated that, in the worst-case scenario, the coronavirus outbreak caused by Omicron variant could result in the death of 75 thousand people in England by April.
Peskov warned Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions about suffering
The Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions if "aggressive actions" against Ukraine continue, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself," said the Kremlin spokesman on air on the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this".
It was reported earlier that the USA is considering imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at making it difficult to convert rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank Herman Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, the vast majority of participants do not want to secede from France.
This was reported by the French channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of voters opposed independence.
3.51% of the South Pacific archipelago's residents supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
Voting turnout that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout was due to the calls by the separatists to abstain from participating in the referendum in light of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to reschedule the referendum.
The referendum of October 2020 saw New Caledonians say no to independence from France.
The region already had a referendum on independence back in 2018.
Most residents supported the archipelago remaining within France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20 thousand kilometers away from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
There are approximately 270 thousand people living on the archipelago, which has a special administrative and territorial status.
Under the 1998 accord between Paris and New Caledonia's administration, the region could hold two referendums on its independence two years apart.

WHO tentatively considers Omicron to be less dangerous than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively considers Omicron to be less dangerous than the Delta coronavirus strain.
In addition, there is data on the reduced effectiveness of vaccines in case of infection with the new COVID-19 variant.
According to information as of December 9, Omicron was recorded in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigen profile of the Omicron strain protein make it possible to assume that the vaccine has reduced effectiveness against the infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary conclusions made in South Africa, it is assumed that it ("disease severity" — Ed.) may be less severe than in case of Delta," is stated in the WHO situation report.
The organization notes that almost all recorded Omicron patients in the EU have a mild disease or no symptoms.
In addition, according to preliminary data, the new strain spreads faster than Delta.
Two Omicron cases were recorded in Russia.
"The patients were previously immune," reported the Gamaleya Center.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable evidence that the new coronavirus variant is less dangerous than the other strains.

Four scenarios for Zelenskyy identified in Ukraine
Vadim Denisenko, a former member of the Verkhovna Rada, listed four possible scenarios for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2022.
According to him, the state's leader could lose support from the West and possibly agree to make compromises over Donbas.
Denisenko shared his opinion in a publication on the Glavred portal on Sunday, December 12.
The first possibility, dubbed "the perfect storm" by Denisenko, is Ukraine losing support from key Western countries that would come to an agreement regarding the country's future without its involvement.
Such a turn of events would contribute to a serious crisis that Kyiv could face in 2023.
"At the same time, the prices for critical goods that we traditionally export fall <...>, and there are internal protests and adversity between the government and FIG (financial and industrial groups — Ed.)," added the former official.
According to Denisenko, there is also another scenario — "war against everyone."
This prediction will come true in the event of highly turbulent world politics causing a number of problems for the Ukrainian government.
This situation might force Ukraine's leadership to compromise on Donbas, which could lead to a conflict within the country.
In late summer, Zelenskyy's standing will weaken; according to the ex-deputy, this situation has a 50–55% chance of occurring.
The third possible scenario for Ukrainian politics is a conflict between those groups of people who disagree with Zelenskyy and the president, which may result in the seizure of control over the security wing, and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
Under this crisis scenario, Zelenskyy will start "reformatting power," added Denisenko.
Yet another scenario is Zelenskyy's transformation into the "father of the nation."
This could be caused by an event that will deliver a severe shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to elicit a reaction from international partners and encourage increased support for Ukraine," added Denisenko.
The ex-deputy believes that this scenario could materialize as a result of a natural or man-made disaster, or Russia's aggressive actions.
Russia itself has more than once dismissed any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.
Moscow says it is the Ukrainian government, NATO and the U.S. who are increasing the level of military activity near Russia's borders.
Earlier, on November 11, survey data from the sociological group Rating showed that the Ukrainian president's popularity hit an all-time low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest it has been since his election as the head of state.
According to the predictions of analysts, in the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelenskyy and 14.5% for the country's former president Petro Poroshenko.
Notably, only 19.3% of all survey's participants expressed their support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story on the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it is very sad to hear.

We also celebrated the other victories, how we supported Salnikov, the football players, all the Soviet athletes.
I once watched a documentary movie on TV about a Central American country, and there they rolled watermelons along the gangway on to the ship, like barrels.
The watermelons were enormous.
In my youth I worked a lot harvesting and loading watermelons in Astrakhan Oblast and never saw a watermelon that weighed more than a pood.
I buy watermelons that weigh 4–5 kg right from the melon field and no earlier than the beginning of August.

Poet arrested for an act on Red Square: "A quote from Yevtushenko gets you 10 days — that is the power of poetry!"
Earlier this week, Alexander Volchenkov, a 21-year-old poet, was arrested for ten days.
The HSE student was detained in Red Square with a banner, which had the #apoetinrussiaismorethanapoet hashtag written on it.
This is a quote from the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A report was drawn up for Alexander on the grounds of repeatedly violating the rules of public protests, which is an administrative offense.
The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square during a rally in support of Alexey Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole — now, regrettably, it has lost its appeal; to highlight the overall decline of culture in Russia; there was also a bit of hope to inspire unknown poets to post their poetry online with this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and study his message in more detail.
How did the police officers treat you this time and before during detention?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your act?
This time the employees were more tactful, the detention was as polite as possible, however funny this sounds in a certain context of this word.
In Pushkin Street, the OMON officers took and took in a tough way.
They asked in a typical way about the motives.
When they heard, they basically looked with understanding, if not with appreciation.
Except for the police lockup being breezy on all 4 sides, everything was as proper as possible, but I knew what I was signing up for.
And if after the act at least several people start writing their poetry under this hashtag, I won't sit through these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, in private, you may speak even in the language of the tumba-yumba tribe.
But at public and official events they speak the language of the people around, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native tongue through an interpreter.
This is nothing more than a protocol, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian fluently but still turns to an interpreter for help.
Also, at official events, transcription is done in the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the transcriber does not need to know several languages.

Researchers explained how potatoes help fight age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace nutrients, which help improve blood circulation and lower the cholesterol level.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
Moreover, potatoes help fight age-associated disorders.
Due to the high content of fiber, they are good for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular consumption can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the root vegetable rather than fry it in oil.
The Daily Express warned earlier that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products containing carbohydrates that quickly break down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction of its production in personal subsidiary plots and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.

But some of them, such as Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix, managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain renaming, he adds.
For example, Lostfilm, which is found in both Yandex and Google search results, has pirated copies of the Netflix TV series "Squid Game" and "Nezhnost", an original TV series from the biggest Russian video service Ivi (Part of the AIV), by movie director Anna Melikyan.
Kinogo, also found by the search engines, offers the new cartoon "Encanto", but in terms of quality, this is a so-called camrip (a pirated movie copy filmed in the cinema).
Filmix, also available through the search engines, offers "Univer. 10 Let Spustya" series from TNT TV channel (part of Gazprom-Media).
Svetlana M., I hate to tell you, but I don't care whether sonny is offended because of his mommy or not.

"This idea developed by Poles" — it would be truer to say that Poland only adapted for itself the idea of the year 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "Ukraine is not Russia" had also appeared in the year 1848.
Basically, it does not change the essence much.

Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A vast circle framed by "molecules" of light provides the space with the most uniform and brightest illumination.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the character and natural essence of each item, does not become irrelevant and allows you to effectively set accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightless design.
Due to the thin, almost invisible cables, whose height can be adjusted, it seems as if the chandelier is floating in the air.
Metal golden fittings and matte-white miniature lamp globes easily complement any palette, and the pendant chandelier and pin-up lamp presented in the collection will be a ready ensemble to illuminate the living room, bedroom, hall.
Well, to the taste and color, as they say.
I very much liked Tarkhuna — not the modern one, of course.
There were very tasty juices on tap from tall glass cylinders.
Three portions of syrup are too much for my taste.
The two were just right.
Dimax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces of different softness — very firm and slightly above average.
The product's composition includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively in the best way.
Springs: a micropackage independent pocket spring unit is placed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 absolutely autonomous springs per sleeping area.
Their functioning is what provides the unique point adjustment.
Micropackage is the highest frequency of all Dimax pocket spring units, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of coir and natural latex layers are placed on the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the slabs.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long borne a classic status, because it gives the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomic properties.
If coir provides proper support for the spine, then latex ensures that the surface adapts to a human body.
Cover: the model is supplied in a quilted knitted Aloe Vera cover.
It can be made either removable or fixed at the customer's request.
Total product height — 27 cm, recommended load per sleeping area — 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period — 3 years.
The mattress has all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability for use.
The orthopedic foam used for the mattress has CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will be looking for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies are preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the planet's atmosphere, reported Aktualnaya Kamera on Sunday.
The goal of the missions that are to be launched in five years is to assess the habitability of Venusian clouds and then to look for life there.
For the project, the Tartu scientists proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was believed that the clouds of Venus, which is the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic to sustain life, but Venus was probably an Earth-like planet originally.
A sample should be brought from Venus during the third mission.
Assuming we discover life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to that on Earth or if it is in fact different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that terrestrial life did not originate on Earth.
If, however, it differs, it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, the head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder team.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of the metaverses gained popularity in fall this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was rebranded as Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the biggest player confirmed that a new format of digital communication between people was underway.
It means that business in Russia, like in the rest of the world, will invest in its own metaverses and their further monetization.
Metaverses are worth viewing as the continuation of existing real-world trends.
On one hand, this results from the trend of distant interaction during the pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a result of the aspiration of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models for them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend toward asset digitalization, when any rights, securities, artwork and even money are digitalized.
Anya, you're right, changing diet is a conscious process.
When you start to eat properly, you no longer want anything too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we will have traditional holiday Olivier salad and dressed herring, but nobody will make me fill myself with everything straight away.
You can eat a spoonful, try it — and it's enough.
After all, we really have ten days off ahead, you can make any tasty and healthy dishes.
But how much hellish work, time, resources she needed for her training.
And, having made 5 quadruple jumps, she ended up without gold.
She also understands that she won't endure the 4 years until the next Olympics, so she will never be Olympic champion.
And anyone who has not just done the sport or can't imagine all the circles of hell that she endured, DO NOT JUMP IN AND CONDEMN HER.
The British Economist could not give any forecasts for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give any forecasts for 2022, as, in his opinion, such attempts will prove to be a complete failure.
He wrote an article about it for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of uncertainties, and any trend may change the situation.
He suggests that the coronavirus pandemic remains the key factor, and the second one is inflation.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase is temporary.
As the specialist noted, before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of the infinite generosity of central banks is a spent force," and now is the time to get back to the relations where interest rates considering inflation will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that in view of the pandemic, sticking to a very soft economic policy, according to some experts, may lead to new burst of inflation.
Moreover, it is worth focusing on the issues of productivity growth, increase in the level of poverty, and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Mikhail Shulgin, Head of Global Research Department "Otkritie Investitsii", reported that positive expectations from the USD exchange rate for 2022 still remain, however, growth potential will be less significant.
Among risks for the USD exchange rate, Shulgin listed the FTS monetary policy, oil price variations and concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
But there is one good thing: if one compares themselves to themselves, there were less containers five years ago.
It is better now.
Progress is being made, but sluggishly.
The problem is this: there are many environmental initiatives in the cities, but people do not know about them.
All kinds of eco-taxis that take waste away from home.
At least a recycling site — it is used by social outcasts.
It is rare for anyone to bring glass or metal there.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
As of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on buying new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale — the state spent approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leader in terms of revenue on the Russian market.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell 325.7 billion rubles worth of cars, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai has even more significant growth — more than 35%, and its revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also a leader in terms of the increase in the car's weighted average price — for Hyundai, it increased by almost 21% over the year, up to 1.94 million rubles — only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had stronger cost increase dynamics.
At the same time, the sales volume of Korean brands did not grow significantly: according to statistics from the car manufacturer committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars during the same period than a year earlier in terms of quantity.
Hyundai — almost 12% more.
Japanese Toyota round off the top three sales leaders in monetary terms — Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on this brand's cars over 10 months, which is 14% more than the previous year.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a factor of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) — the German premium brand has increased its sales (by 37%) and the car's weighted average price (by almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has both good growth in sales and weighted average price — more than BMW, for example — hence the greater growth in the financial capacity, explained the general director of NAPI Tatyana Arabadzhi. —
Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year, demonstrate fantastic sales growth performance."
Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators in terms of income growth dynamics (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on this brand's cars over 10 months.
There are companies at last year's level in terms of financial capacity whose car sales in units fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is even in the red — over 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on this brand's off-road vehicles and pickups of against 12.4 billion rubles the previous year.
Amid problems with the supply of car components and production disruptions that affected the global car industry, car companies keep constantly adjusting prices — AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times in the year, the last increase (by 8–10 thousand rubles) happened at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers also regularly rewrite the prices of their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase — in addition to the car shortage, inflation contribution to this, as well as the car concerns' desire to win back their past losses, experts say.
With the car shortage, I think many car groups have even been able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put into the car price earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, car industry analyst at VTB Capital. —
I believe car manufacturers are feeling very good financially right now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the car cost, observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert specifies.
In the long term, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mostly due to inflation and the sophistication of the cars' design, predicts Bespalov.
As the supply grows, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the car cost growth slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from the volumes, says Sergey Burgazliev, independent consultant on the car industry.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now trying to get the most profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes. —
Increased car production is not expected for at least the next half-year, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by peoples' uncertainty in their future.
Against the background of the current market situation, cars turned out to be a good object for investment — a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original cost, states the expert.
Biden expressed his opinion on the relocation of US military forces to Ukraine in case of a Russian invasion
U.S. officials never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There never were such plans," said the head of the White House in answer to a journalist's question about whether the USA had rejected such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the USA and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the USA will deploy their forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 — all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred commitment to protect from any Russian attack," stated Biden.
Earlier, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to the Russian President, emphasized that Moscow had no intentions to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow saw a problem in Kyiv's military use of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are getting closer to our territory".
I walk out of such interviews immediately.
If at the interview they already want me to put up with being shouted at, waiting for hours, drinking some sort of balderdash and then washing the cup, it is dreadful to think of what the work will be like.
I will find a normal place for myself, without an HR layer, where you talk to the leader directly.

If a scammer calls from such a number, pretending to be an "officer from the interior ministry" or other law enforcement agency, it is not effective to immediately hang up, and you probably won't manage to blacklist it in time.
Because, to confirm his lie that he is affiliated with the law enforcement agencies, he will quickly call again and continue to intimidate and persuade.
The people need recommendations that are more useful.
What nonsense...
I really don't believe it was like that.

The movie of Alexander Sokurov's student received the European Oscar for best film editing
According to Moskovsky Komsomolets, the Russian movie "Unclenching the Fists", which was nominated for the Oscar, received the European Film Academy Awards (also called the "European Oscar") in the Best Editing category.
The award's jury, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the excellence of the filmmakers.
The movie "Quo Vadis, Aida?" by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia) received the maximum number of awards this time.
The female lead of the movie is a UN translator who is trying to save her family during the Yugoslav War.
As for the drama "Unclenching the Fists", filmed by Kira Kovalenko (alumni of Alexander Sokurov), this movie tells the story of the uneasy relationship between an autocratic father and his coming-of-age children who want to break free from father’s care in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that the movie is nominated for the Oscar film award as the best foreign language film.
As shown by the regular friendly meetings among the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey you are, in my opinion, ill-informed, to put it mildly.
Just yesterday the president of Azerbaijan approved of the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KamAZ enterprise.
