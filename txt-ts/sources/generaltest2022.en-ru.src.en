A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee.
So to note, I didn’t witness this.
I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job.
These two guys came to the store.
One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law.
After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it.
This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door.
Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid.
When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him.
I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle.
I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on.
But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set.
He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados
President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states.
"We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming.
Everything," he said.
"And obviously it has some impact here."
At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm.
The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history."
He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate.
"All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said.
The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change.
"As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle.
"How are we going to handle this?" he continued.
"Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen."
Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution.
"So we have to act," he said.
Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms.
"I promise you.
Whatever is needed.
Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said.
He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government.
"I want folks in all these states to know.
We're going to get through this.
We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said.
"This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans."
The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts.
"I do plan on going," he said.

Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13-7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.
Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team.
Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench.
Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks.
For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.
Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle.
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.
It concluded an exhilarating spell of end-to-end rugby in which the rivals took it in turns to attack from deep and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13.
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing a brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report
Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization.
POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.
Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus.
According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.
Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test.
In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.
The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.
The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.
According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes.
In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.
The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently.
Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).
In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.
As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.
"I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee.
We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.
This technology is currently before commercialization.
However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed.
Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials.
The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters
Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK.
They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march.
Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.
"All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram.
Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it.
An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.
UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it.
It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade.
The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council.
The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse."
Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city.
The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march.
A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest.

We still don't know the reason he was killed.
A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist.
The whole community are shocked.
May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents."
Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager.
Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him.
This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances.
There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible.
We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us.
I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why.

Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size
Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage.
Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage.
I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone.
I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case.
After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data.
After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do.
I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable.
Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue.

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests
Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago.
Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act.
Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence.
Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement.
Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations.
Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement."
All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground.
Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out.
It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns.
We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again.
We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said.
Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019.
Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU.
"We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure.
The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said.
Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.
Their heart was in the right place, but unfortunately, because of the way it was funded, the activities of the downtown manager were subverted by the city.

Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned.
I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300.
But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not.
If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all.
It might just narrow your deficit that one day.
An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though?
That’s a no go.
If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place.
Maybe start with 300 deficit.
Hope this helps!

Missed Out on Shiba Inu?
EverGrow Might Be The Next Big Crypto To Explode in 2022
Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.
A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!
Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.
Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO (fear of missing out) to pile into the meme-coin.
Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.
In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future.
Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so.
There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack, and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.
Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts.
One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1-to-1 with the USD.
The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.
With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.
With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation.
Yesterday, CoinMarket Cap placed an alert on EverGrow's page, confirming that the data error had been fixed.
The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.
However, EverGrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error.
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.
Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.
If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.

He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him.
How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop.
My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.
These neighbors and I share a fence.
It separates our back yards.
Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard.
I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc.
but this dog is insane.
The maintenance guys are afraid of it.
So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill.
I can't even use my yard at this point.
That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop.
I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence.
Owner says no.
I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.
Owner says no.
(Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.)
Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan.
I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*.
Like, I saved and invested in this.
Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker.
There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked.
When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up.
My speaker shakes the table.
It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.
The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it.
The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays.
Edit some grammar errors
Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL.
This can seriously harm and even kill an animal.
Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested.
It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit.

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions.
This isn't even necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now.
> Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently.
Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough?
It also makes for some terrible UX.
Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?
And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean?
> This is in contrast to Google.
Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share.
I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps.
That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.
The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough.
Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests.
"Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement.
The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue.
The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26."
On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.
Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring
Got just the one Christmas tree?
Then you could be behind the times.
This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring.
More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol.
Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia.
Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours.
Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.
Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself."
British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites.
Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees."
Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more.
Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep."
Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber.
Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response.
In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state."
He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era.
"Christmas can be a pretty stressful time.
A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things.
That is always good for sleep."

Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills.
While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia
The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced.
"We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic."
He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE.
The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy.
"If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated.
According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list.
In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week.
According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak
Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club.
Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday.
It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground.
Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday.
The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool.
Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat.
Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results.
Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed.
Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

Wendy Rogers Calls New Zealand PM 'Lenin With Hair,' Claims 'Satanic Communists' in U.S.
Republican Arizona Senator Wendy Rogers on Sunday called New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern "Lenin with Hair" and warned against communism in the United States.
Rogers appeared to be criticizing Ardern's COVID response as she referred to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in a Tweet she posted along with a short clip of the prime minister.
Rogers didn't further explain her criticism of Ardern in her Tweet.
In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID misinformation and New Zealand's efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic.
"More bold Christians are needed in office to counter the satanic Communists in both parties," the Arizona Senator wrote in another tweet on Sunday.
Her Tweet was met with ridicule from different social media users, with one person tweeting back: "Please offer your definitions of Communism and Christianity, because I don't think you understand either."
"I see that Wendy is going all out today, trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy," another person tweeted.
Rogers has been vocal about her stance against communism before on social media.
In September, she called Labor Day a "Communist Holiday" without further explanation.
Her tweet was mocked among social media users, including The Arizona House Democrats, who replied: "Says the heart and soul of Arizona's Republican Party (prove us wrong)."
"You do realize that if you keep falsely calling all good things communist you're only going to make communism more attractive, no?" asked another social media user.
Republican Senator Wendy Rogers warned against communists in America and called for having more "bold Christians" in office.
Writer Shiv Ramdas also denounced the tweet by paraphrasing her own words: "'working is Communism.'"
Separately, Rogers has frequently suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and called for a new election.
"I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be conducted.
Arizona's electors must not be awarded fraudulently..." the senator tweeted in July.
In July, Rogers campaigned for the election to be decertified and previously launched a petition that she claimed gained 663,000 signatures.
"Things are really taking off!
Let's get to 1 million ASAP.
Audit results are coming soon, more states are coming online," she tweeted in September.
The Trump supporter has also pushed for debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Newsweek contacted Senator Rogers' office for comment.

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece
The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates.
France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates.
Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table...
We also signed the contract with the Greeks.
Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon."
The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates.
The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning.
Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."
This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.
With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.
A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.
It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
He denies wrongdoing.
The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.
In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.
The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser.
Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.
The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says
Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.
Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.
"Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting.
It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress.
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months.
The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks.
"The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said.
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.
The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported.
The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord.
The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2?
Specifically 2.10 "Over"
Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting.
Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this?
Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?"
A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time.
I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations.
I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday.
Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs.
Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time.
I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son.
He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person!
He clearly sucks at damage control.
Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5
An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others.
The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.
The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.
"Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.
They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said
In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.
The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).
"We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.
People got excited," DeBerry said.
"We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border.
He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office.
It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday.
Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow.
Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues.
The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there.
Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government.
The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages.
Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner.
The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.
Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday.
She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage.
She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border.
Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries.
On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels.
Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure.
His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

Russia warned of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacked
The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.
US intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.
Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate.
"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources.
"We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future," the draft said.
For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a "red line" it will not allow to be crossed.
Mr Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
In 2014, Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to slap sanctions on Russia.
The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow's "red lines."
The G7 comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union.
"We call on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities," the G7 said in the draft.
"We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the draft said.
China's Xi and Russia's Putin dominate the G7
Pope calls for 'serious international dialogue' to defuse Ukraine tensions
Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, today called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.
He said he was praying for "dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons."
Weapons are not the path to take.
May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine," the pope told thousands of people in St Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.
Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10% of the population in the former Soviet republic.
Separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay "a terrible price" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course
I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course.
The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module.
Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only.
The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth.
I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules.
The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.
If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.
Here is the course intro

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas
Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus.
So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers.
But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view.
My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic.
Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance.
On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not.
What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child?
I dread to think.
I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing.
For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right.
It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020.

First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife.
I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P)
Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right.
Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone.
I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way >.<...
So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day.
Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc.
While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history.
Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial.
How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts.
Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such.
Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things.
Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms.
This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me.
What I am after is the other side of the picture?
As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff.
So how was the response from 'the old gang'?
Did you keep doing stuff together?
Did you slowly drift apart?
Still chat or invite one another to events?
Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats.
Kinda the opposite.
I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt.

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me.
When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause).
Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”.
I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car.
A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental.
None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).
None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim.
They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage.
Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department.
I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.
If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

Android hardware Cleaning tip
Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.
They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles.

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80
She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said.
Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.
"I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010.
"Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series.
Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.
Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died.
Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D
The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays.
On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.
These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.
I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it.
How come we never saw the main shuttlebay?
It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility.
Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13.
In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.
Couldn't they have done this on TNG?
We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.
We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space.
The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."
We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?

Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans
Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation.
Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings.
Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power.
There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow.
Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported.
A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall.
Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital.
Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued.
Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency.
The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes.
Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road.
Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said.
Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow.
The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas.
An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning.
Many roads were temporarily blocked by landslides in the south.
Elsewhere in the northeast and southeast of the country, heavy snow has hampered or temporarily blocked traffic.

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list.
You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag.
A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality.
A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance.
Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available.
Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow.
Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one.
Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole.
The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number.
The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood.
To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip.
Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners.
External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying.
Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used.
Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area.
Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering)
Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use.

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk
South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.
"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.
I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.
A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.
Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

Move the trailer!
Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop.
I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster.
No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it.
The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something.
Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella.
The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly).
Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster?
Me: No, the owner drove yesterday.
Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster!
Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it.
Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there.
You know we need to have access to the dumpster.
Me: but I didn’t park it there.
Why don’t you talk to the owner about it?
Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah
Me: It was not me.
The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way.
From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.
I have gone to the mall.

We had power go out a couple of times.
Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately.
They are security now.
Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands).
Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there.
Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again.
Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave.
As well as every cart brought to the front.
Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.
Step 6: Return said cold/produce.
Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc.
Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out.
(Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go).
It's really dark, even upfront.
No way can we let customers just hang out.
I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't.
Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay.
I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later.
One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on.
They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen.

Oh, so glad you asked, I have a lot to say about this.
Yes, there’s been a pretty drastic change.
I have been overweight/obese since I was 3 years old, so existing like that is all I ever knew until age 30.
The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.
damn.
supportive.
I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit.
One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss.
Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.
Unsurprisingly, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.
At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.
When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it.
Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it’s in excess these days).
The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.
When I was bigger, people really didn’t pay me any attention.
Like, little to no eye contact.
No saying hello or smiling at me as we pass on the street unless they knew me.
Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment me.
It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.
I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.
Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it.
I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project.
Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc.
Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that’s just platonically.
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol.
It is DAUNTING.
I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.
It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually.
Huge shock to me.
I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet” is NOT the way to go.
I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw
A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world.
"The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
"People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it."
He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it.
The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years.
It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government.
Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more.
Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability.
"I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors.
Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days.
Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing.
The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software.
Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software.
Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous.
New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released.
The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said.
It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

Liz Truss pledges another £75m in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting
A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced.
The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."
It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what co-ordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers.
The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.
Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.
The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.
We are determined to do all we can for the people of Afghanistan."
The additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
It will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.
The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO).
Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations.
The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.
David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would "help us save many lives."
"What we are seeing on the ground is heart-breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis," he said.
"Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."
This week the UN's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was "happening before our eyes" and urged the international community to take action to stop "the freefall" before it leads to more deaths.
Martin Griffiths said: "It's getting more and more dire by the week."
The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.
Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.
Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that "considerable capacity" was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul "Pen" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane.
The Prime Minister has called the claims "complete nonsense."
At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.
The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south-east Asia's "economies of the future" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said.
The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region.

The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was.
Needless to say, it was chaos.
At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was.
I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks?
straws?).
Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7."
Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off.
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there.
A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not.
He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8.
I'll help you find them, ma'am."
As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know".
Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line.
As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her."
HA....told you so!
I doubt she's coming, isn't she?

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up
The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys.
After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game.
When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks.
The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning.
Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury.
The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity.
This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players.
Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups.
It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88).
Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands.
Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts.
We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area.
Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."
Hey r/Military!
I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.
Hello everyone!
I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force.
Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.
You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.
In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.
However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.
If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such.
I am just wondering how is it for other countries?
If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?
What do you guys think about mandatory military service?
During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.
Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military.

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system
I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories.
Not much to say here.
The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly.
I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them.
“Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.”
To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular.
I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on?
Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline?
“Sure, OP.
I am saving money to move.”
This is really rare.
My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever.
Where is she moving?
To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry.
I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer!
It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work.
So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city.
She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine.
Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.

Water heater temp and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment).
Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold.
If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?
Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied?
Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice!
I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation.
It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.

I was buying new tires.
I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website.
I printed out the page and took it to my local shop.
It was part of a chain.
The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout.
Don’t know where he got the higher price from.
Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout.
He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price.
He was gracious about it too.

Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS.

Boris Johnson teeters on edge of favour with Tory MPs
Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks.
And some Tory MPs hope he'll continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.
The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.
First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year.
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface.
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however.
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.
But it could have been worse.
There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.
Ministers will quietly breath a sigh of relief no pictures of these scenes have been leaked - yet.
While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic.
The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen.
On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson "thanking his staff" and used it to play down the party scandal as "hype."
He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."
Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a "one rule for them" narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson.
Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge.

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life'
Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected.
The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning.
The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings.
Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services.
It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country.
More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27.
Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7.
STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row.
The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers.
The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute.
"Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said.
A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland.
"This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said.
"It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime.
For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."

Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help
I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders.
I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question.
I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc.
I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question.
He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping.
He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily.
I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone.
I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it.
He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away.
How was I supposed to have known he needed help?
He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite.
This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help.
He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.
